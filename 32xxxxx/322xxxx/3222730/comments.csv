,Thijzer,2007-02-04T18:26Z,"When I tried to run setup.bat, only for a brief moment, a black box appeared. Then, when trying to run the game, after the first screen, it says an error : Error in loading mas file options/options.mas. What should I do?"
,Thijzer,2007-02-04T18:30Z,"I found out what it sayd in the black box:

Can not execute the selected programme."
,Thijzer,2007-02-04T18:43Z,"In the MASPAK.EXE file, there also pops up a little text box saying this

EA F1 2000.EXE .mas Packer (c)  2000
Left in intentionally for the CLS guy with the inferiority complex :)
Good luck finding the bug!

and then it says usage: and then the file location. When typed that in at CMD, it says that it has incorrect syntaxis, what should I do?"
