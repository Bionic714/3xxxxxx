Alright here is a real treat for you,two shows by bands that don't exist anymore. I filmed both these shows and if you like bands like Snuff, Leatherface and China Drum then you will love both of these.
The first is Guns And Wankers which has Duncan from Snuff singing and playing guitar instead of the drums. The second is Hooton 3 Car who hail from same part of the UK as Leatherface and China Drum.
Trust me you will love these shows. Enjoy!
