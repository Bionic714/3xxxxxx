,TunaTron,2004-07-25T09:23Z,"Är ny till BitSpirit så ni får urskäkta om det gåt lite knackigt...

Undrar om jag inte byter tillbaka till Azureus iaf :/"
,TunaTron,2004-07-25T10:18Z,"*gah!* BitSpirit bara muppar sig så jag skiftar tillbaka till Azureus! Kommer ta en liten stund eftersom Azureus måste ""kontrollera datan"" som ligger på en extren USB-disk. När det väl är klart kommer jag seeda i några dagar..."
,TunaTron,2004-07-25T10:40Z,Såja! Nu kommer det seedas det i några dagar =D
,sam_gamgi,2004-07-25T15:33Z,Gött att du fortsätter med seedandet - ser enormt mycket fram emot att få ner detta paketet :)
,Gruckel,2004-07-25T21:51Z,Tack så mycket undrade vad som hännt med den tidigare har suttit ganska länge på 96% nu :P
,TunaTron,2004-07-26T16:49Z,"Ibland beter sig Bittorrent lite mungo. Fastän du i själva verket kan köra allt problemfritt så visas det ändå som 99,9% är klart.

Förslår att du prövar ändå!"
,Gruckel,2004-07-26T21:33Z,Spelet fungerar perfect men manualen och nfo filen går inte att få hem till 100% av något annledning :P dock så hade jag manualen sedan tidigare :/
,sc00by,2004-07-28T00:12Z,"Alltså än en gång, tusen tack! Du har räddat min dag. Riktigt trevligt också med alla covers och det."
,BizzyBone,2004-07-28T20:30Z,funkar inte... Först installerar den disc 1 sen frågar den efter disc 2 o sen disc tre o sen disc fyra o sen disc fem o där säger det stopp. Använder alcohol120. Och ja jag har mountat alla discarna Hjälp nån??
,TunaTron,2004-07-29T04:57Z,Många har haft det problemet...Vet att bränna ut skivorna har funkat för vissa. Det är det jag skulle pröva först antar jag.

,dostov,2004-08-11T12:49Z,"Det står att det blir ett fel när jag installerar hur jag än gör varför?

Är det dåliga saker någon laddat upp eller är det bara jag som är dum?"

,TunaTron,2004-09-27T19:37Z,"För det första så vet jag inte varför jag har med cracket alls, för det fungerar alldelles utmärkt ändå. Det är ju trots allt bara ett ""NoCD-crack""

För det andra så anser jag att istället för att låta nedlåtande så kan du visa uppskattning att jag faktikst la upp den över huvudtaget. Alla gör missar lite då & då. Dessutom behövs igentligen inte ens cracket som sagt..."

,Midvinter,2004-12-22T05:25Z,Tur för er att det här spelet är out of production. Annars hade jag vridit nacken av er för att ni piratar det enda sanna spelet i världshistorien.
,jammer,2004-12-24T01:19Z,"tjo, har ju orginalet med tob expansionen.

tänkte spela det igen men min cd 1 e trasig så tänkte kolla om det skulle funka att ladda hem ca 10 % av denna torrent för att få hem cd1.

eller måste jag ladda hem hela skiten?"
,TunaTron,2004-12-27T16:46Z,Beror på vilken klient du använder... I BitComet & Azureus vet jag att det går att väla vilka filer som skall laddas ner.
,rillebanck,2005-01-03T22:38Z,Vaddå cd5? finns väl ingen cd 5? jag är helt förvirrad:S:S:S

,zubutix,2005-01-19T20:43Z,"har någon lyckats installera hela spelet på hd:n? så att man slipper hålla på med cd skivor. Har aldrig använt daemon tools förr, så tänkte köra det när jag fått hem BG2 och testa.

fungerar det? nån som har provat?
"
,zubutix,2005-01-20T07:35Z,"jag försöker installera direkt på hd:n. Jag har packat upp alla filer, men det står att filen inte hittas (för TOB och SOA)!!!???

hur fan gör man?

snälla hjälp. Jag har inga cd skivor just nu så jag vill installera direkt på hd:n

TACK"
,zubutix,2005-01-20T07:38Z,"alltså... det finns ju för fan ingen SOA??!! kollar igenom allt jag packat upp. man måste ha SOA installerat för att kunna installera BG2 TOB står det.

Det finns även en mapp som heter CD5. kanske den som spökar för vissa här?

hjälp!! har nån bara packat upp och installerat?

please help me"
,zubutix,2005-01-20T07:44Z,"eller har jag fått allt om bakfoten? skulle man ha SOA innan man laddade ner denna torrent?

När jag kör patcharna står det att filerna inte hittas. och när jag försöker köra nån av setuperna så står det att jag måste ha BG2 SOA installerat innan jag forts'tter med denna jag laddat ner... suck suck SUCK

fan"
,zubutix,2005-01-20T07:51Z,"finns ingen SOA med bland filerna. endast TOB. man MÅSTE ha SOA för att installera detta... har letat bland filerna an kvart nu. SOA ÄR INTE MED.

bra!"
,zubutix,2005-01-20T08:00Z,"totala MB när jag packat upp allt är drygt 3-400MB!!?? men det var 3.07GB att ladda ner...

alltså jag blir tokig. 

snälla. hjälp. efter jag packade upp allt med rar så fanns inga ISO filer med. Det är bara ett setup directory. som man hoppades skulle fungera"
,zubutix,2005-01-20T08:05Z,"vill be om ursäkt för allt gnäll. hade aldrig använt daemon tools som jag nu testade. Andra iso filen körde jag med daemon tools, då installerade jag SOA som man alltså först ska installera

sorry"
,zubutix,2005-01-20T18:51Z,"JAG HAR NOCD CRACKEN OM NÅN VILL HA.

Kör daemon tools och börja mounta CD1 sen är det bara att följa instruktionerna (att byta ""CD"" alltså). Efteråt kör du bara den fungerande nocd cracken, och voila, game on.

messa mig och lämna en mailadress om du behöver nocd:n


"
,zubutix,2005-01-20T18:56Z,"***JO, efter ni mountat (installerat på HD:n) kör ni PATCHARNA (eller en av dom, minns inte), sen NOCD cracken.

,karlozo,2005-06-04T13:52Z,alltså då jag försöker installera så kommer den till 37% och sen vill den att jag sätter i cd 2 och direkt efter cd3 o sen cd4 o sen cd5... men jag har bara 4 skivor..... vad gör jag?

Det här har jag letat efter länge :-D"
,Yupik,2005-06-20T13:18Z,"NooB here, and sorry i don't speak swedish. I downloaded this file but never worked with .ISO before. heard i had to burn image onto cd. I use Nero. Here is the problem...i unpacked every cd and put it into separate folders. when i try to burn the image in Nero then i cannot choose the unzipped file. I could burn the whole rar.file since it is an ISO but would the game still work? and how about the autolaunch? every help is apreciated.."
,k11u,2005-07-02T15:15Z,"Yupik you don't ""unzip"" the .ISO files they are binary copies  (images) of the actual CD. When using Nero Express just choose Disc Image and then just choose the .ISO file and burn away...And there's your BG2 install CDs"
,Jambalah,2005-07-02T16:57Z,"Buggade sig för mig med när jag försökte med full installation, frågade efter cd5. Löste detta genom att bränna ut alla skivorna istället för att mounta dom."
,Helixa,2005-07-04T01:26Z,som sagt...vid full install vill den gärna fråga efter cd 5 (som inte existerar). gör en recomended install istället så borde det fungera...
,simpen,2005-07-04T14:50Z,"Hur installerar man detta spel egentligen? Kan inte någon göra en mini tutorial?

,Fenster_,2005-07-29T18:31Z,"Hey btw. Another good advice is: USE DEAMON TOOLS ! i've tryied with alcohol, and ive tryed manualle, but the only thing that worked was deamon tools. Just mount the first CD with it and then it should work :)"

,Juventinos777,2005-08-13T21:08Z,Hey asshole do you know that the 2nd iso is destroyed?
,Khamero,2006-01-04T20:46Z,"I am sorry to find that the rumored fifth disc is NOT the first one. at least not what I have found so far. -_-  You can run a minimal install and then install ToB, but its still buggy. Managed to make a char, not in SoA, but ToB, only to have the game crash when I try to have a closer look at a neclace. I did manage to make it run without the crack though (as the crack was specifically for the full or recommended version). 

Summary, the fifth CD is not the first, or any other CD that came along with this torrent. The game can be made to work, but just hardly, and with bugs here and there, especially in the interface. 

I´ll be looking elsewhere for this. Anyone who has a decent torrent of BG2, with or without the expansion, please get it up here!"

,Senapsburk,2006-02-01T20:33Z,"Efter att jag läst om problem som folk haft med att installera spelet och att cracken inte funkade var jag tveksam till att ladda hem 3.1 GB.

Så här kommer lite info till de som funderar på att ladda hem spelet:

Använde daemon v4.00 och mountade cd 1, tog full install. Fick frågan om cd 2, cd 3, cd 4 och vid 95% av installen cd 1 (fick aldrig någon fråga om att sätta in cd 5). Efter full install av SoA installerade jag ToB och sedan  ToB_patch_26498 och sist NoCD_crack 26498.
Innan jag startade spelet körde jag BGconfig för att ställa in ljud och grafik. Har spelat i 30 min utan crash, ljud eller grafikproblem.


*********** SPELET FUNGERAR ***********"
,Senapsburk,2006-02-01T21:58Z,"Some info to people that cant understand swedish. Here is a translation to english, from my previous post.

I used daemon v4.00 and mounted cd 1, took full install. Got asked to insert cd 2, cd 3, cd 4 and at 95% of installation cd 1 (I never got asked for cd 5). After full installation of SoA I then installed ToB and ToB_patch_26498 and last NoCD_crack 26498.

Before starting the game i ran BFconfig to set sound and graphic. I have played for 30 min without any game crash, sound or graphic problem.

yes, cd5 is missing.

yes, you can play the game. How?

Install as directed, load cd1-2-3-4 and when it asks for cd5 unmount either cd 2,3 or 4 and mount ToB. Install ToB and play.. BUT! DO NOT EXIT THE SoA SETUP! it will remove all the files (as they are temorary since the install is not complete!)  Its fuckd up, i know :P  but hell... atleast you can play the damn thing after wasting time on DL'in it right? Just minimize it or put it down in the corner of your desktop...

- When asking for cd 4 mound it
- Now it will ask for cd 1 and not cd 5 (mound cd1)
- Now start the game. It will tell you to put the cd2 in the real drive, so either burn the cd2 ISO or use the program ""Starforce nightmare"". This program will allow you to disable the cd-drive and make the game think that there is no real drive. The game will still ask you for the second cd, but now you can mound the cd2 in the drive and PLAY.

Set deamon tools to 1 drive

install the game on the minimum instalation

whenever it asks you to insert a new cd during the instalation just unmount the one you ahd in and then mount the one its asking for

when you run the game and it asks you to insert cd 2 all you need to do is minimise the game and mount cd2 with deamon tools

hope this helps"

The bug is...it's like something is constantly pressing a hotkey. If I try to find traps it'll automatically stop as if someone kept on repeatedly issuing another order.

On my mage, if I was holding a wand in the FIRST quick item slot it'll repeatedly have me select a target (with the star and moon cursor). If I have potions in the first item slot it'll continuously drink them until they all run out (it happens on NPC party members too). I can't cast spells (or my NPC party members) because I can't get to my spellbook (using the cast spell on the bottom action bar, as if someone kept on 'canceling' it). It's a really weird bug.

,jojojo80,2008-12-02T23:55Z,"This is a fantastic torrent.  I want to say a few things.  First, concerning comments - Besides the three or four people who actually know what they're doing, tere are 9 pages of useleess comments, most of which really sour my attitude toward the intelligence of the human race.  It boggles me that someone wil post, ""HELP, IT DOESN'T WORK,"" right after someone fully explains what to do concerning the install! 

Second, please stop with your - .BINS DON'T WORK, YOU NEED MAGIC ISO or whatever other program your wailing about.  You need Daemon tools and Daemon tools only for this torrent and out of the 100's I've successfully installed, I have never needed more than Daemon tools.  Stop saying it doesn't work when you're not even bright enough to make sure you have the latest version, please! Because I am sure others will attest, we are sooo tired of your blabbering about what works and what doesnt when you are wrong.  Some people really need some help and are sincere.  That's fine.  Your cursing and birrage of 6 comments in a row, all in caps and five year old ""you = u / thanks = thx"" notation is not.  

My biggest suggestion is to study the program your using before you use it and especially before you say it doesnt work.  Is it so hard to figure out that you can say ""recognize all files"" to mount a .bin and that a .cue is not even needed? Really.  And I didn't study this crap - I learned it on my own by having patience and READING and not just going nuts and trying to install something as if I were cramming a bagel into a toaster. Thank you.

After the download, open your latest version of Daemon Tools and mount cd1 .iso.  If it doesn't autorun, you know what to do.  If you don't, find another hobby.  Next, do a FULL install.  When asked for cd2, don't unmount.  Just mount cd2 on the same drive and continue until it asks for cd 1 again.  Mount cd1 and finish install. If you dont want to install tob, use cd2 to play.
Next mount the tob.iso and install, once again a full install. after this you can decide to play by mounting the tob iso or doing the patch / nocd crack. If you want to do this, which I reccomend, take the patch out of th download folder and place it in your BGII directory, then install.  You must do this prior to using the nocd crack. For nocd, simply extract the file to you BGII directory and overwrite your .exe and that is all.

This game is awesome and so is Pirate Bay.  Many of the people on hear are great and I don't mind lending a hand when I can.  If your a leecher, well there's nothing I can do, but as a computer wizard in training I am now casting a fatal error spell targeted at all your rigs.  May your hard drives crash to the point of no return as the cores of all your processors vaporize

,jojojo80,2008-12-02T23:59Z,Oh and Japan Alex - What are you talking about the .iso is the .rar file? This is what I mean.  The rar is nothing but a few jpgs. The iso's are right in front of your face.  This is how people get confused and a simple torrent turns into a megaspamposting disaster.

,Chadathin,2009-01-22T18:06Z,"Oh, and as far as the nocd crack goes, I haven't messed with it at all, but who needs it? Do a full install, mount discs one at a time with Daemon or something similar, patch it and play. You don't need discs after a full install, and even if you did, you could just remount easily. I fail to see why the nocd crack would even be useful unless you didn't do a full install."
,UnknownMonsta,2009-01-26T19:39Z,"Before I get flamed for asking how to get this thing to work. I just wanna let you know this is the first out of I don't know.... 30 games I've ever had trouble getting to work.... I can get it installed no problem. 

However, I can't get the crack to work. I tried burning each CD to a disk, and that'll get me to the menu where it asks if you wanna play Shadows of Amn or Throne of Bhaal. 

Well I select shadows, it asks me to swap disks, and BAM the game freezes. I tried loading with said disk and it still freezes... I've also tried mounting the playing disk with PowerISO and still no luck... So guys I'd appreciate some help, and I'm going to go ahead and thank you in advance...."
,shinateku,2009-01-27T02:05Z,"alright I'm having a slight issue. It isn't with installing, the comments earlier helped with that, but rather with the starting of the game.

it tells me to configure first since it is my first time.  thats cool, so I configure it.  then I click ok and it doesn't start the game nor does it let me play the game from the launcher (just tells me to configure it.)  any advice would be appreciated"

You can only do  ""MINIMAL INSTALL"" everyother one asks for a 5th disk which isnt noti ncluded int his torrent. BUT! i havent tested it yet, u can FAKE it by following these instructions. These are directly from the bio ware website here

http://www.bioware.com/games/shadows_amn/support/faq/index.html?faqID=40#1.29

Minimum to Recommended Install

1. Do a Minimum install.

2. Edit your ""baldur.ini"" file. Change the line ""Install Type=1"" to ""Install Type=2""

3. Copy the following files from CD2 to your BG2 directory, where [cddrive] is the letter of your CD-ROM drive and [BG2] is the location of your BG2 install

[cddrive]\CD2\Data\CREAnim.bif ===> [BG2]\data\CREAnim.bif
[cddrive]\CD2\Data\CREAnim1.bif ===> [BG2]\data\CREAnim1.bif
[cddrive]\CD2\Data\GUIMosc.bif ===> [BG2]\data\GUIMosc.bif
[cddrive]\CD2\Data\MovHD0.bif ===> [BG2]\data\MovHD0.bif
[cddrive]\CD2\Data\NPCSoCD3.bif ===> [BG2]\data\NPCSoCD3.bif

[cddrive]\CD4\Data\CD4CreAn.bif ===> [BG2]\data\CD4CreAn.bif

You now have a Recommended install.

Minimum to Full Install

1. Do a Minimum install.

2. Edit your ""baldur.ini"" file. Change the line ""Install Type=1"" to ""Install Type=3"". Also, you will need to edit the [Alias] section. Make the following changes where [BG2] is the location of your BG2 install

[Alias]
HD0=[BG2]
CD1=[BG2]\CD1
CD2=[BG2]\CD2
CD3=[BG2]\CD3

,spearthebigones,2010-03-08T03:36Z,"Bill_Oreilly 

I had the same problem on Baldur's Gate I where I couldn't hear the voices while playing the game.

It's a real easy fix, at least for Baldur's Gate I! You simply need to change your sound setting on your computer so that the speaker setup ""configuration"" is set to ""stereo"". These old games weren't designed to play surround sound and that's why it mutes the voices."
,RealDream,2010-03-21T14:57Z,"Where's the last CD?
I find CD 1, CD 2, CD 3, CD 4 and CD ToB.

Everything is installed, but some areas need another cd to mount. The Expansion CD. Where is it in the torrent?

Specifically: I'm travelling to Watcher's Keep (ToB area) but the game tells me I need another CD. ""Place Expansion CD in Drive D."" I've the ToB CD mounted, and I've tried to mount the other CDs as well, but none works. So is there a ""hidden"" Expansion CD in the torrent or not?"
,OlbrieN,2010-04-30T13:44Z,"Okey guys, I had problems with this game. After installing the game like bigdicknick8463 said, I still couldn't manage to play the game. The game started, the movie comes on, but when I have to chose between both games SoA or ToB it would ask to insert the expansion disc and that it wasn't inserted in Drive.

I managed to work that out, and now I play the game without any problems.

First you should do this


Minimum to Full Install

1. Do a Minimum install.

2. Edit your ""baldur.ini"" file. Change the line ""Install Type=1"" to ""Install Type=3"". Also, you will need to edit the [Alias] section. Make the following changes where [BG2] is the location of your BG2 install

[Alias]
HD0=[BG2]
CD1=[BG2]\CD1
CD2=[BG2]\CD2
CD3=[BG2]\CD3
CD4=[BG2]\CD4

3. Copy the following directories (and all their contents) from the BG2 CDs to your BG2 install folder, where [cddrive] is the letter of your CD-ROM drive and [BG2] is the location of your BG2 install

CD2
[cddrive]\CD2 ===> [BG2]\CD2

CD3
[cddrive]\CD3 ===> [BG2]\CD3

CD4
[cddrive]\CD4 ===> [BG2]\CD4


Now, after doing this, you must do for cd5 too. 
CD5 is located in the .iso file BG2 ToB

So...

CD5
[cddrive]\CD5 ===> [BG2]\CD5

Also you should change your alias for CD5 too...

[Alias]
HD0=[BG2]
CD1=[BG2]\CD1
CD2=[BG2]\CD2
CD3=[BG2]\CD3
CD4=[BG2]\CD4
CD5=[BG2]\CD5

Now I think you could manage to play the game, but... I also changed the configurations of the game. I'm not sure that is needed, but I think it is.
Go to where you installed your game, open BGConfig go to 2d 3d options, and put a mark on 3d animations, use 3d acceleration, 32bit texture.

I hope it works, like it worked for me =d"
,newslimepirate,2010-05-08T03:20Z,"It seems I have found a solution to the CD5 error. I searched on other forums and found that many people (and myself now) got it working using this method. (I got it working on my first try installing this game, so whether it would have worked had i not used this method, I do not know for sure)

Note, this worked on the FULL install. I did not attempt the recommended install.
Simply, mount the image for the CD you need, allow it to install its portion of the game, and then it will ask for the next CD.

At this point, UNMOUNT the current CD, wait 5-10 seconds, mount the next CD, wait 5-10 seconds, and continue with the installation.

Sounds too simple to work, but nevertheless it works as it did for me as well as other people on other forums.

If all done correctly, it should ask for CD1, then CD2, then CD3, then CD4,
AND THEN AT AROUND 95% IT ASKS FOR CD1 AGAIN.

After you mount CD1 again at the end, it will finish installing, then play a short video trailer, then you will be completely finished."

,Bakbar,2010-06-07T08:49Z,"Okay I have just a small problem. I downloaded everything and installed with no problem, and just played for an hour with no crashes.

However, the no-cd crack doesn't work. I copy it to the directory folder and it tries to apply a patch or something. I already patched the game beforehand.

I can still play the game by mounting the disc, but a way to get the crack to work would be appreciated. Or maybe another crack somewhere."
,copiedname,2010-07-21T08:34Z,"I was getting an error during RECOMMENDED installation, when it asked for CD2, I clicked the CD2 folder, but it said file not found. I found fix,  when it asks for CD2, DO NOT specify a folder, simply mount CD2 and click ok/next. This worked when it asked for the other CDs as well.

Not sure if this works with minimum/full, but it worked for me."

For nocd, simply extract the file to you BGII directory and overwrite your .exe and that is all."" i cant figure out how to do that... can somebody help me? i would appreciate it"
,Kyully,2010-08-14T17:06Z,"Goddamnit people, Disk 5 actually means Disk 1, the first, play disk. The answer is just a few pages back, you people could be less lazy, eh. Also having problems burning and/or mounting images when you never did it before is nothing retarded, you have to start somehow after all, we all did. I will make a detailed guide after downloading this torrent if people still need it."
,Kyully,2010-08-15T03:55Z,"Okay, so here's the guide. Just follow there steps and you should do fine.

1 - Download this torrent.
2 - Download a tool called ""Daemon Tools"", or ""Daemon Tools Lite', it makes no difference. Just google it.
3 - Install Daemon Tools, start the program and then create a virtual drive. Just search for ""Virtual Devices"", then ""Add SCSI Virtual Drive"".
4 - Again in ""Virtual Devices"", click on the virtual drive and then click ""Mount Image"", then search for the ""BG2_CD1"" ISO file located in your torrent folder. It should automatically pop-up the Baldur's Gate II instalation setup. If it doesn't, go to your My Computer and then click on the mounted image.
5 - Start installing the game. After a while a message should pop-up asking for you to insert CD2, so just follow step 4 again, but this time mounting the ""BG2_CD2"" file. Go back to the setup and press OK. When CD3 is asked, just mount it. And so goes for CD4. It then will ask for CD1 (or CD5, CD0, whatever, doesnt matter), just mount ""BG2_CD1"" again and press OK.
6 - After the instalation is done, a promo video will be shown. When it ends, your setup will say that the installation is done and you may play, but don't start the game just yet. Go back to Daemon Tools and mount the file ""BG2 ToB"". Another setup will pop-up. Install it, it's an expansion.
7 - Finished the installation, go to your torrent folder (where the disks are located) and search for the ""BGII-ThroneofBhaal_Patch_26498_ENGLISH"" file. Just double-click and install it. It's very quick and it'll be over before you know it.
8 - Still in the torrent folder, search for the ""Baldur's Gate II - ToB - NoCd Crack 26498"" rar file and extract it (if you can't extract the file, download WinRAR, google it). You'll have three new files. Run one of them, ""Baldurs Gate 2 ToB v2.6.4.9.8 Crack"". A program will appear, which you'll press ""Apply Patch"". It should search and create automatically a crack for your Baldur's Gate game. After all of this is done, just run baldur.exe in your install folder and it should start.
PS.: If while cracking a message like ""BGMAIN.EXE : not found or already opened !"" pops-up, this is natural because the crack is shit as are the people who made it. No matter what you do, it won't work. But it won't affect your game, you just need to mount ""BG2_CD1"" again and start baldur.exe.
9 -  Don't forget to seed at least in a 1-1 rate. Share the love!"

,bamfbamf,2011-07-10T16:56Z,"Um don't keep running setup.exe?

When you mount an iso for installation it starts setup.exe by default... so after you've installed you have no reason to keep auto-running setup to reinstall the game.

Just go to wherever you installed the game and run the actual application file, or better yet make a shortcut of the game when you install and turn off daemon tools autorun setup otherwise every time you mount it will simply try to run the setup.exe."

,sutoko,2012-04-25T02:25Z,"Easy way to install this;

Extract all the ISOs into one folder, install game.
When it asks for CD1, mount it with UltraISO or something, point the installer to the virtual drive.

Install ToB the same way, extract to a folder, install from there.

Install the patch, you can get a crack from GameCopyWorld that will crack any version of the game and you're done.
