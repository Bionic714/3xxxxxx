We usually don't release games from Japan.
But this game is both English and Japanese.
It just came out early in Japan like the other fighting games
on the consoles. Readme, installer, character speech
and text in story mode is Japanese.
Movies, Menu text and other sounds etc. is English.
        
For users who don't know Japanese,
we have included a translated config.exe in the HOODLUM dir
on the CD so you won't have problems with game configurations.
