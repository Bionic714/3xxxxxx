Bästa i Castlevaniaserien och ett utav de bästa på PSX överhuvudtaget! =D"
,negativeions,2005-01-07T21:30Z,"Does anyone have the Japanese ""greatest hits"" version of Castlevania: Nocturne in the Moonlight? (Symphony of the night in North America)... I read about how it has some improvements and bug fixes. If someone could post a translated version of that, that would kick ass..."

,The_ChOsen,2005-07-03T21:58Z,"Är det någon som vet om man kan köra det här spelet på xboxen? Det vore guldvärt om man kunde göra det. Har en emulator som heter pcsxbox, går det att använda den kanske?"
,Ichi Killer,2005-07-07T15:22Z,I can´t get it to work. I´vetried  burned it on cd and run it with swap magic.. how to do? thanks/Ichi K
,ExceeD,2005-07-30T19:06Z,The_ChOsen: Jaa det går att använda den men då måste du fixa bios för att köra. det gör jag. Men för det mesta så funkar det bäst att köra på skivor. //ExCeeD

,DJCoppy,2010-03-30T00:21Z,Please people compair the filesize with other torrents before u complain. You can't probably hear any sounds because there ain't no sounds in this psx rom!
,endopivot,2011-02-10T21:17Z,"For those who are having problems (years later lawlz?) Just use ""PSX EMULATOR"" from emulator zone. ePSXe is crap and requires too many plugins for too many games. But ""psx emulator"" is self contained and works with 87% of the ps1 games out there. All of your mainstream favorites will work and doesn't require stress unlike ePSXe. I hope this helps."
,dono1990,2012-08-19T08:47Z,"Anyone having issues with choppy video or sound should burn this at 2x , playstation 1 and 2 often can't read CD's burnt at high speed."
,miketrad,2012-08-31T15:04Z,"For those looking for an ISO to burn and play on the console, this is not the case. Those are .bin and .cue file for emulators."
,miketrad,2012-09-04T15:33Z,"actually, nevermind that. These files can also be burned as images, my bad."
