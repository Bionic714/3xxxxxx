Ultravox second album. With John Foxx. Co-produced by Steve Lillywhite.
Very different from the more famous Vienna/80Â´s/Romantic stuff that I found awful then & now. 
The 3 John Foxx/Ultravox albums are all very good and quite different from each other. 
This one starts off with the lamest track on the whole album "Rockwrok", skip that on your first listen as it is not representative of the album at all.

1. Rockwrock
2. Frozen ones
3. Fear in the western world
4. Distant smile
5. Man who dies everyday
6. Artificial life
7. While I'm still alive
8. Hiroshima mon amour


I would be very happy if anybody could post their first album "Ultravox!" and the third "Systems Of Romance".
