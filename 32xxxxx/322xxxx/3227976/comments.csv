,chox,2006-11-23T13:43Z,"somebody fucked up this torrent because it seems that everyone who download this it stops at 97,9%....now don't fuck around seed this because I and about millions of other people want it..."
,Zurr0,2007-04-01T04:08Z,"Lame, so I like everyone else seems to be stuck at 99.7% LAME.......... :/"
,Zurr0,2007-04-06T22:02Z,"I seem to be the only seeder as of April 6th 2007, I'm not gonna seed this much longer because I've been stuck at 99.7% forever now. Meaning I the only seeder does not have the full torrent. I advise everyone else leeching to find a different torrent. I only have 6 of the 9 songs so....whoever originally seeded this sucks cause they never gave the full 100% or somewhere down the line someone didn't. If anyone else finds any Shiva Chandra, give the link!"
