I would be very gratefull.

,Lomechuse,2004-07-10T01:49Z,"I dont have it but i can find it.

As I dont know this album and I am willing to discover it.

Let me a few days to download it and I'll make a torrent as soon as I have it.

Thanks for your support.

Dub music is so great.

,Lomechuse,2004-07-10T01:55Z,"My mistake.

I thought No more Babylon was a song from Pierpoljak.

You made me discover a new band.

As soon as I found something about them (both : Pierpoljak and No More Babylon).

I will share it."
