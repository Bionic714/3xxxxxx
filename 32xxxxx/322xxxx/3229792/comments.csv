,doclucas,2006-04-21T17:23Z,Actually it's using explorer.exe to send the information to eblaster.com. You can block it easily with a firewall...
,maree464,2006-06-26T19:07Z,How would you do that?  I use windows xp firewall.  I would love to use this program.
,karma_iroq,2006-08-13T17:44Z,so.. someone would have reported this is if it was a virus right?

,invisghost,2008-03-07T02:53Z,"Spector uses windows explorer to contact eblaster, so all you have to do is block it from the internet with pretty much and good firewall and you will be fine. Good Wishes!"
,EpicPhail,2008-06-09T00:49Z,"Does this only work on your computer or is it like Win Spy, where u can send the files 2 other ip's and then remote connect 2 them?"
,Uglytroll,2008-06-20T01:07Z,"LOL, learn how to make an entry in your HOSTS file located in C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\Etc.
Put eblaster.com with a redirect to 127.0.0.1 (your comp) and it will never kill the license.

Sheesh... remember people... Google is your friend

,1sh0t1kill,2008-08-10T17:00Z,"I too scanned this with Norton 360 and came up with 2 threats. a Trojan horse and some sort of spyware. Norton removed both and rendered this dowload useless. 

Don't download this, it's a waste of your time. "
,BleedingCello,2008-09-02T07:33Z,This software is a descendant of the Netbus Trojan horse...and it's a keylogger for christs sake!!  Did you not expect AV to pick it up?  No...something more descrete you say?  Set an exeption on the AV software you're using!  Easy as the host redirect Uglytroll posted...right?!
,inmiserysshadow,2008-09-15T22:25Z,"hey has anyone found a way to block the connection to the internet servers so this program doesnt get de activated?  I tried that workaround but it failed, and I cant find anyone who has done it.  i am trying to use the newest one..6.0"
,JSt.O,2010-12-31T17:29Z,Norton detected a trojan horse in the keygen
,venus32,2011-05-16T11:09Z,"Hi, I need some help:
Why does Spector Pro keeps recording even in inactivity?

It wasnâ€™t like this before, it just started recently. It suppose to stop recording when all activity has ceased. I have the ""Inactivity timeout"" marked and set to 3 minutes, but still it never stops recording, I wonder why. I remember having this problem in the past and it only got solved when I formatted my PC, but I don't want to do that.

Tried unistalling, but didn't work.

Any idea?

Thanks in advance.
Regards. "
