Alright here is an amazing show by the German band Terrorgruppe, this is just brilliant and anyone who likes there punk rock should get this, you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!

I have also included the first time i saw them which was on a talk show on German tV called Arabella, its a classic bit of TV.

Terrorgruppe-The Bizarre Festival "Rockpalast" German TV 23-August-1998 SVCD 35 Minutes

Terrorgruppe-Eich Bein A Punk Arabella Kiesbauer Show 1995 SVCD 3 Minutes

This is in SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
