Mischief 3000 is the second coming after the huge success of the first Teckademics movie, Mischief. The DVD/VHS features our team on an underground cross country rally remenisant of the Cannonball Run, during the spring of 2002, starting in NYC, with stops at Graceland, Vegas and ending up in Hollywood, CA.

The rally features exotic and import cars being put through hell and top speeds of 200 mph. The Teck/DTM Power BMW M3 outran the cops while filming the whole 3000 mile jaunt. It was also equipped with a police scanner to stay one step ahead and to record the frustration of local Highway Patrol and State Troopers.

Mischief 3000 also features pro-skateboarder Josh Kalis, racing Playmates, DTM Power Australian streetracing, extreme auto launching, drifting, hot models, US streetracing, crashes, burnouts, feature cars, import shows, racebikes and the kind of mindless mayhem you would expect from the worldÂ¹s leader in import streetracing movies.
