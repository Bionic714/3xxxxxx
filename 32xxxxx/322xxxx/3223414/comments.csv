,Toystory12321,2009-03-28T12:16Z,"Works fine, but the installer doesn't.
1) Once downloaded, select all the .rar files, right click and select ""Exract here"" it will take a few mins to do this. 
2) Run the Regsetup file
3) Click the toy2 launcher

This game brings back lots of memories but the camera in it sucks xD"
