 |                   [Final Fantasy IV & Final Fantasy V]                    |
 |                                                                           |
 |        Final Fantasy IV was originally released for the SNES in           |
 |        1991, with Final Fantasy V following the year after; both          |
 |        are clearly products of the pre-PlayStation era, before 3D         |
 |        graphics and FMV cutscenes became the norm. That said,             |
 |        these re-issued classics have been brought into the modern         |
 |        era with the introduction of new FMV sequences that beauti-        |
 |        fully illustrate the plot, but the majority of the gameplay        |
 |        takes place in good old fashioned 2D. Fortunately, when the        |
 |        storyline and gameplay are this compelling, the lack of            |
 |        visual flair really doesn't matter.                                |
 |                                                                           |
 |        Final Fantasy IV was the first game in the series to               |
 |        demonstrate the kind of in-depth character development that        |
 |        would make the later titles so successful. The plot centres        |
 |        on the activities of Cecil, a Dark Knight and commander in         |
 |        the Imperial Army, who resigns his post after a crisis of          |
 |        conscience, and is forced to undertake a series of dangerous       |
 |        adventures, and eventually battle the evil Zemus. It was           |
 |        also the first Final Fantasy game to feature the "Active           |
 |        Time Battle System", which revolutionised turn-based RPGs,         |
 |        and ensured that FF IV was a massive success in both Japan         |
 |        and the US.                                                        |
 |                                                                           |
 |        The ultimate enemy in Final Fantasy V takes the form of a          |
 |        tree, by the name of X-Death, but the real danger is posed         |
 |        by his equally evil (and far more fearsome looking) henchman,      |
 |        Gilgamesh. It's a game that's regarded with great affection        |
 |        by aficionados of the series, thanks to its innovative "job        |
 |        system". This effectively allows you to assign a job (ranging      |
 |        from Warrior or Magician to Magical Dancer) to a character         |
 |        at any time, which will bestow appropriate skills to the           |
 |        character. Clever use of these jobs in conjunction with            |
 |        skill-boosting items can create a bewildering array of             |
 |        different skills and abilities, lending FFV an impressive          |
 |        level of customisability.                                          |
 |                                                                           |
 |        Both these games are established classics of the RPG genre,        |
 |        and have stood the test of time remarkably well. Although          |
 |        they can't hope to compete with the visuals of contemporary        |
 |        RPGs, their storylines and gameplay more than hold their own       |
 |        in the 21st century. Fans of the Final Fantasy series can't        |
 |        afford to miss these fascinating blasts from the past, and         |
 |        anyone looking for compelling role-playing gameplay will be        |
 |        surprised by how well these two titles have aged.                  |
 |                                                                           |
