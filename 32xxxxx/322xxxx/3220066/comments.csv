,michaelrwatson,2012-01-01T10:00Z,"Quality is good, with hardcoded English subs for Russian dialog. Also Polish subs in separate file. Aspect ratio seems to be off a bit but can easily be adjusted in VLC player, Core Player, Quicktime player, etc. Thanks!

Great cast too: Willis, Richard Gere, Sidney Poitier"
