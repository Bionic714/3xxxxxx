,Wiggen,2004-07-11T11:24Z,är det stand-alone eller måste man ha civ3 installerat?
,solanum,2004-07-11T16:53Z,Ganska säker på att du måste ha Civ3. Det finns dock seedat här på trackern så det är ju inga problem.
,lundberg2410,2004-11-30T09:40Z,Där är nogenting fel med lyd filarne. Spellet sluttar och talar om att där saknas nogla filar. Hvor hitta jag dom??
,duochjag,2005-03-18T16:37Z,Är det någon som vet hur man får det att funka? Spelet låser sig efter en viss tid.
,djo0606,2005-04-08T23:28Z,Nån som har lyckats att installera spelet? Det blir typ nå konstigt när man ska extracta r27 nå sånt

,Florentin91,2007-10-08T16:41Z,seed please
,Deppe309,2008-10-26T22:22Z,"everything is ok, until i click to play the game, it says ""please insert civilization III: conquests CD-ROM"" what to i have to do?"
,djdesi,2008-12-20T07:26Z,"4) Copy over the cracked game .exe files from the CD.
5) And then play :)

===========

It means that the icon that you click to play or start the game should be replaced by the .exe file from the crack folder.

Hope this helps. Also would like to thank the uploader and the seeders for keeping this torrent alive. It was uploaded in 2004... WOW and now its a few more dats to 2009.. ;)

Happy New year all..."

,haligonian,2008-12-24T02:51Z,"ok, it is installed with Daemon Tools, but when I run it I just get the ""Error"" window poping up with the ""send"" or ""don't send"" error report buttons.  this tells me absolutely nothing about what is wrong.  any suggestions? i tried reinstalling twice."
,jmhimara,2009-01-18T17:30Z,"man , i've used deamon tools to run the bin/cue file and when the instalation begins ,it says that ""civilizaion III wasnt found instaled in my computer"" when like 5 minutes before I was playing civ 3.pls can anyone tell me what to do"
