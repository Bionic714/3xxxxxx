Of course the Stooges were stupid, that was the whole point. Three chords were okay, two were even better, one or none (the cacophonous 'L.A. Blues') was best of all. Drunk on their own testosterone, Iggy Pop and Co. kept things simple, loud, and brutal--and he's been coasting on the band's rep ever since. Slow and thuddy as it sounds now, almost nobody had ever made rock as primal as this second album. Iggy howled like a psycho, the band sounded like they could barely play the elementary riffs, and occasionally a moment of bone-headed poetry made it through the glorious muck. --Douglas Wolk 


What can you say, Iggy is a legend and this is a great album from his early days fronting the Stooges. EAC/LAME 3.95 VBR...
