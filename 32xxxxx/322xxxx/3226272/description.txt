  Description:

  Players will assume the persona of one of eight uber-contemporary
  racers with varying nationalities as they speed through a wide
  variety of racing locales that include indoor stadiums, classic
  outdoor tracks and extreme fantasy courses that defy conventional
  laws of physics. Up to 11 opposing go-karts will be competing at
  once, each featuring fully animated and hyper-aggressive
  adversaries as well as intricately rendered vehicles. Several
  gameplay modes will keep players coming back for more, including
  Scenario (story), Arcade, Time Trial, Tutorial and multiplayer
  battle mode, featuring pick-ups and tricks to play on rival
  racers. In addition, the game allows players to experience
  Furious Karting in their own way ? if the game is played 
  aggressively, special challenges are unlocked; if played fairly,
  the player is rewarded with ?happy endings.
