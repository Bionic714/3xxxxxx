This is the first Partition Magic ISO that does actually boot off the CD , so Thank You!"

[V],maestral,2010-03-19T16:39Z,"THANX THANX THANX for this.

I finally manage to format my old Toshiba laptops HDD after 3 months, which was unformated when bought and i had no other way to format it and install OS to it. Now its formated and its bootable and everything working great.

If anyone has probs like i did, THIS PROGRAM REALLY WORX.

ALL RECOMENDS FOR THIS ONE. GREAT WORK."
