,Ocean2me,2005-02-22T16:12Z,Where are the Audio files? The Map Audio is empty
,Karnaa,2005-02-22T21:52Z,"You have to choose ""Burn image file to disc"" in NERO...
Then select the .iso file and NEXT..."
,maravilha00,2005-04-17T11:17Z,"this film has absolute SHIT picture quality, I am sorry to say! Don't know who made the shrinking and how, but that's absolute crap! "
,Karnaa,2005-04-18T20:36Z,"I think the sound is more importiant than the picture...
Does anybody else think that the picture sucks???
If soo! I´m sorry"
,Kronocide,2006-06-09T17:01Z,"The picture is fine.

Let me just point out that the '73 movie is not shit. In fact, as much fun as this one was to watch, neither production, acting, or singing hold a light to Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson's version. This is still not bad though."
,annorlunda45,2006-08-18T01:10Z,"There seems to be a lack of musicals here so a took the liberty of adding Cats to this fine community?
