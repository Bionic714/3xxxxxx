,GooglyMoogly,2005-03-22T00:37Z,"LAME VBR isn't really true though, according to EncSpot?

A few Xing ones, a whole lot of bunch of Fraunhofers... some LAMEs and some even looked messed up. Which version LAME did you use?"
,ltoth,2005-03-29T02:51Z,"EncSpot is misreporting. No Xing, no FhG, only LAME. The version of LAME used is in the 'Encoded by' tag."
,Vissarh,2008-10-03T05:18Z,whats the deal with the LAME compressing?
