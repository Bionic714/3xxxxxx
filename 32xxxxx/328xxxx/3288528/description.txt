A CounterStrike orgy from the happy bunch who gave you Haxxad at Remedy. The producers  and stars of the movie are presented in more detail in the movie itself. Well, at least you get to know what they look like. :P

The events portrayed in this film transpired at the DreamHack Winter 2004 LAN in Jönköping, Sweden.

Contains: Pretty much what you can expect from a good CS-movie; som nice frags, some nice music, some nice editing, some nice effects, and some humor. :) 

Enjoy! And don't miss out on the blood chilling duel between Badskurt and Kaka. ;)
