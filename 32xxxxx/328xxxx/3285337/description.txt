Composed and performed in Rome around 1710,  when Handel was in his 20ies, this short profane Oratorio whose complete tittle is La Bellezza ravveduta nel Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno, with a libretto by Cardinal Pamphili, is a masterpiece of creativity and virtuosism.  
Minkowski with his ensamble of singers and performers is the best confronted with the others conductors who have done this work.
The Aria: Ecco il Sol ch'esce dal Mare....  is one of my favourite.  
Enjoy it. :-)
