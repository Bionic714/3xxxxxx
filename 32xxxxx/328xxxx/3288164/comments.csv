,E.T.S,2005-02-16T21:49Z,"haha typiskt de där pctorrent.. mest skit de har, tankar inget från dom. brukar inte ens fungera."
,gfashg,2005-02-28T21:47Z,"hei, folkens, funker spillet helt bra????"
,danking,2005-03-30T14:25Z,"Is this PAL or NTSC can someone tell me as soon as possible as im downloading and at 70% it says english but cant be sure!

Swedish translation.

Är den här KAMRAT eller NTSC kanna någon berätta jag så snart som så im dataöverföring och på 70% det står åt engelsk utom skränande vara säker!"
,Big_F,2005-06-04T11:38Z,"Vet någon ifall man kan köra med emulator detta spel?
I så fall hur gör man?"
,messus,2005-06-15T23:57Z,"This game does NOT work on my PS2 (Two / Slim), with SwapMagic 3.6. Have tried several different media in different speeds... Is there a patch for it??"
,messus,2005-06-16T03:39Z,"Ok, I followed this guide:

http://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/3/127255

And rebuilt the ISO image with ISOBUSTER and Sony CD/DVD Creator..

The Image went from 4.3Gb to 2.5Gb, and now the game is working 100%!!!!

Good luck!! :)

,step.down,2006-01-16T21:46Z,"There is a complete lack of seeders on this torrent, why are there so many leechers?"
,step.down,2006-01-23T14:37Z,"This must be another NTSC version, if you have SwapMagic 3.6 you can change it to PAL, but you do get a size mismatch."
[V],kaxig_idiot,2006-10-27T11:57Z,seeda!!!
,LittleCrazyDevil,2007-02-10T10:10Z,"Detta spelet funkar inte, det hakar upp sig vid laddning.

This game doesn¨t work!"
,FieroGT42,2007-03-04T23:46Z,"messus: Since you have it working, is it NTSC or PAL?

step.down: are you confirming this as NTSC, or making an educated guess?

LittleCrazyDevil: SwapMagicFix.com says you'll need to do the additional ""large TOC"" disc swap when using a boot disc, or rebuild the disc image before burning. I've done both with PS2 games in the past, so whichever you prefer: small hassle every time, or more technical and tricky permanent fix. :)  Follow the link messus posted for the latter solution.

messus has it working properly, so I'm sure you can as well. :)  I'll post my results as well if I ever get the torrent to finish d/l.  ;)"

BTW, looks like Demonoid has a 1.93 GB torrent of the NTSC version.  It's archived, but if it's still smaller after unzipping, maybe it's already rebuilt and fixed? :)"
