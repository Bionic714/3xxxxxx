Release Notes

  This is a list of 41 unused GMail invites. GMail is a free web-based 
  invite-only e-mail provider by Google. It offers a huge amount of storage 
  space, which is 1GB. You'll have to test the links yourselves, because we 
  can't be sure whether a link has already been used by another person. 
  Anyway, a couple of friends of mine wanted to ditch these babies, and we 
  don't really care what happens to them anymore.

Installation Notes

  1. UnRAR
  2. Check whether link has already been used
  3. Subscribe
