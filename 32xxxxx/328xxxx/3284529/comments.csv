,nutterino,2005-02-11T00:21Z,"Great upload, does anyone have Vol 6? Thanks"
,struisvogel,2005-02-11T19:56Z,[PGac] has Volume 6. You can find it at either here or at torrent-spy. Normally you need to register but if you use Bitcomet you can select individual files from the torrent. If you deselect the url etc. and only select the actual package you should be able to get around this. At least it did work for me. It will take a while tho as you are sort of a ghost in there.
,LouisCeifer,2005-03-03T18:14Z,"anybody have versions 12, 13 & 14 yet...am still stuck on 49.3% of v6 and couldnt get a version from torrent-spy...and i need the architectural textures quite badly!!! can anyone help....thanks!!"
,Nysseh,2005-03-27T14:57Z,"Could you possibly upload some other Total Textures cd's also? I'm missing vol 3,6,10,12,13 & 14"
,Azeworai,2006-01-09T01:00Z,Can you pls seed?
,Arvetis,2006-02-22T01:13Z,Why does piratebay never work for me anymore?  It always says the tracker is down.  Is my client type banned?  I am using uTorrent.
