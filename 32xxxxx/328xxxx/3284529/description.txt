Total Textures v11 is a collection of Alienesque organic textures. From the weird and slimey, to more 
subtle toned skins, these textures are made up from many layers and elements captured by 50% photography 
and 50% hand painted. Many textures have several combined layers resulting in the examples you can 
see here. Of course like all of our textures they are 100% seamless and have additional hand crafted 
extras such as matching bump maps, many have specular maps too.

The average texture size is 1024 pixels on each axis but some range a little higher. All of 
the textures are jpeg format (saved at the highest quality setting) and so are compatible with 
all 3d and 2d software.

As with all of our CDs there is a interface which runs in your browser (works on all PCs and Macs) 
to enable easy texture previewing and selection. Plus access to the extras bonus material in the form 
of tutorials and project overviews. These give an insight into how the textures can be used.
