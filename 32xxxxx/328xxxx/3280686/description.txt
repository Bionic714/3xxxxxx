Babe Ruth, Michael Jordan, Tony Hawk, Shaun White. Every decade produces great athletes. Every decade produces a super-natural. This decade, his name is Shaun White. He was showcased more by the age of 15 than most people are in a lifetime. Shaun took the snowboard world by storm. From placing 1st at the Sims World Championship in Vail, Colorado to the new car he won in the Toyota Big Air in Japan (he didn’t even have a driver’s license yet), to winning the prestigious “Artic Challenge” in Norway ? Shaun is becoming a household name. Now at the age of 17, and after 12 podium spots last season, Shaun has grown into the big boy style and has the veterans a little concerned with the “Flying Tomato”.

Athletes include: Shaun White, Travis Rice, Danny Kass, Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek and Bob Burnquist.
