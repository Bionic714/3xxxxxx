If you have ""Master of Orion III"" or ""UFO: Freedom Ridge"" could you post that too. Please keep the hosting up untill i'm done. I'll try and do my part to keep the torrent alive after I have downloaded the file. Also I can't do unlimited seeding or it kills all my downloads I have to limit it to 40k."
