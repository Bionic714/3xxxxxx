,YowzaTheBear,2007-08-27T22:24Z,"Been stuck at 97.6% with 7 or 8 others for days now.  Only 9 of the 17 tracks are at 100%.  There's another torrent, Moody Blues Greatest Hits (1996) that has all of the songs on this torrent except for ""Blue World"", which is one of the ones here at 100%.  Just an FYI.  There is no 100% seeder even though the number here is listed at 1. My advice is not to download unless you see 2 seeders or more."
