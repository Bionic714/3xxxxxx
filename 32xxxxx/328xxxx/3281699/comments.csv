,jorego,2005-01-26T05:48Z,jag skulle vilja ha alla 3 filmerna om detta. läste en artikel i nån tidning och vart ganska intresserad.
,jorego,2005-01-26T05:52Z,"yeah i would like Paradise Lost 2: Revelations also. i thought it was three movies about this case, isn't it?"
,Titleist,2005-01-26T08:55Z,"Lysande, denna har jag letat efter länge."
,Azania,2005-01-26T09:57Z,Great work - saw this some time ago and it is great to get a copy. Thanks for bringing this out. It would be fantastic to get the folow up you mention which I havnt seen yet at all.
,tll,2005-01-26T13:29Z,"Sorry, only got the first two. In fact, i thought there was only two, perhaps someone else got the third?"
,figge_banan,2005-01-26T14:48Z,Ja lägg upp tvåan också! jag har hört att det ska komma en fyra också men det kan va skitsnack!
,jorego,2005-01-26T15:00Z,"maybe there's just two, but i think i read in an old magazine about the third movie, maybe it's not released yet."
,TheAbsorbant,2005-01-27T00:05Z,"Lägg upp tvåan också!! Och trean om någon har den... Henry Rollins och Rollins Band åkte på en turné nyligen där alla intäkter (utöver kostnaden för själva turnén) gick till The West Memphis Three... Personligen tror jag att det var den där farsan (som hade en kniv som ""råkat"" bli avtorkad och som ""råkade"" få en tand avslagen när de hittat bitmärken) som gjorde det...

Put part two up too!! And part three if anyone has it... Henry Rollins and Rollins Band went on a tour recently where all the money (besides what the tour itself cost) went to The West Memphis Three. Personally I think that it was the dad (who had a knife that ""accidentaly"" got wiped off and who ""accidentally"" got a tooth knocked out when the found bite marks) who did it..."
,tll,2005-01-27T02:58Z,"I will post the sequel on friday, or perhaps on thursday night, depending on how many seeders there is on this one."
,SKEEZMO,2005-06-17T07:50Z,"I would love to view this film and it's sequel, but having trouble finding it.  Is there any way someone could please reseed?

,bjellerup,2005-07-24T19:32Z,"Hey! I started downloading the documentary here and I had a good downloading rate, but now it stuck at about 2 KiB/s. Could someone with a good uploading speed help the rest of us out?"
,Mossman85,2005-08-04T22:45Z,"more seeds plz, thnx"
,johnnyr,2007-09-28T13:22Z,More seeds please?
,cheree1,2009-08-23T06:42Z,"I saw the secind one yesterday on the crime channel, so im doing this the other way round... but the second film was quite good. I cant believe they are still locked up. WTF is wrong with America man... Wot a fucked up country."
