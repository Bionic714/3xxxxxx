,garbagebag,2010-12-15T23:05Z,"ClTIZEN you suck and you know it. Are you some fat cat record exec or something? The world is moving on. If your album is good enough we will buy the original CD and go to your concert - move on looser, the argument's over! This is what you call progress and if you don't embrace progress you'll be left behind with the dinosaurs."
