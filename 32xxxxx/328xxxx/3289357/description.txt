Sailor Moon Live Action. Sawai Miyuu is the live action actress of Sailor Moon in the series "Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon." 

This is Miyuu's second DVD. She is the age of 14 here. This is the second half to Miyuu's "ME" DVD. If you haven't already watched the first one, you should start with that. In this DVD, the introduction has toned down a bit. You'll now get to watch Miyuu participating in more sports, dabble with some voice acting, and doing some other random activities. There happens to be more focus on her modeling here. Just like the previous DVD, there is a happy vibe that goes on that you can't miss and it reflects the charm of Miyuu's personality quite well. 

Released by [AK] Arctic Knight Productions.
