.    Notes: Hope you enjoy this longer cut :)                                . 
.    It's 5734 frames longer than the version kjs and qix released, not      . 
.    counting the opening and ending credits. As this source is pal, it      . 
.    will not translate directly to a longer runtime (pal speedup to get      . 
.    25fps). Anyway, it has around 4 minutes additional footage. Check the    . 
.    included samples and you'll see it (r1 sample is 38, extended sample    . 
.    61 mins).                                                                .

.    Another thing: the R2 source dvd had the video cropped differently      . 
.    than the R1 dvd, nothing i could do about it.                            . 
.                                                                            .
