Welles as Harry Lime is the most fascinating anti-hero of the screen.
Alida Valli is simply beautiful, both her and her character.  The last scene, when she walks past Cotten is a complete metaphor of love wrapped in few masterful frames.  
I am dling this one since the quality looks better than the copy I have.  
Thank you, Pippin"
,KennyKans,2005-01-23T14:44Z,"One of my all-time favourites - thanks, mate. It's - in my opinion - probably the best movie ever made when it comes filming.

... and it's got one of the best quotes in movie-history:

""In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias, they had 
warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, 
but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, 
and the Renaissance. 
In Switzerland they had brotherly love - 
they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? 
The cuckoo clock ...""
