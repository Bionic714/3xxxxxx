,cdude,2006-08-17T15:21Z,"this is a low budget Japanese VHS rip.  It's lame unless you are a Paul Gilbert fanatic, in which case it's only ok.  It's kinda like the ""How to Draw The Tick"" superhero comic which was in 3 panels:

Step 1: Draw an oval
Step 2: Draw a line through the oval
Step 3: Draw The Tick holding the oval with the line through it.

Only this is:

Step 1: Play this C# note
Step 2: Play this E note
Step 3: Play this Chopin Etude in double time using one hand on the guitar

that's basically this video to a T. :p"
