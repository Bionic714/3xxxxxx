[T],trollfan,2005-01-24T04:03Z,"You mod your console with a chip and then burn it on a Mini-DVD, or you can stream the game to your computer with Fantasy Star Online."
,luyckychris,2005-01-29T00:55Z,www.swemods.com                     has chips. You can also burn the game on a regular dvd-r and remove the top part of the case :)
,Kezoburk,2005-02-12T21:34Z,"what do you mean with ""remove the top part of the case"" if you are swedish, answer in swedish"
,full,2005-02-20T16:22Z,"in english..
this is iso file that you burn onto miniDVDr or DVDr

you will need gamecube with a modchip(viper GC) 

miniDVDr works fine but if you have DVDr you have to take the top cover away from gamecube that the DVD fits to spin.."
