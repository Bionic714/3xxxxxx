,Crillson,2005-02-16T19:10Z,"Final Fantasy 8 v1.2 update Crack

Hur du gör för att spela utan cd.
Installera spelet med install cd:n, kopiera Field.FI och Field.FL
antingen från ""FINAL FANTASY VIIIdata(installations mappen)""
eller ""cd 1"", till installations mappen där FF8.exe ligger.
Sen kopierar du DISC1.PAK och DISC1. Du ska även kopiera in
Samma filer från cd 2,3 och 4 de har bara en annan siffra.

Installera uppdateringen (packa upp ""FF8SqeaNVPatch.zip"" i installatons 
mappen), Kopiera ""Crack12.exe"" till installations mappen och starta cracken.
Starta FF8CONFIG.exe och ställ in de inställningar du vill ha.

Sen är det bara att köra spelet med den crackade filen FF8.exe


Enjoy

Help is appriciated!"
,Ramzith,2005-03-11T19:03Z,"ive got the same problem it crashes midway through the FMV on the end of disc one, the Rinoa/Edea FMV.

Now i dont want to hear any geek telling me that 

""have you updated your drivers""
""have you installed the geforce patch""
""have you installed the crack from goldendragon""
""have altered the registry""

---

I am using Daemon tools. the game works fine for the fist CD, but the FMV is the problem. if there is way to resolve this issue then i wouldnt advice downloading the game cause you will just get pissed off when you cant continue any further then disc one.

for all you Swedes out there.

vad hander grabbz? skiten funkar juh inte! nagon datanisse som vet hur man far det att funka?"
,thebobsmiley,2005-03-11T19:39Z,"Någon som har lust att tala om vad man ska göra? Jag har gjort som någon sagt tidigare men det funkar inte...
Exakt hur funkar cracker egentligen?"
,Ramzith,2005-03-11T20:23Z,"star>run>

type regedit

go in to the game folder through regedit (by default it should be in your cprogram filessquare soft incfinal fantasy

now click on 1.00 

now on your right hand side there should be a icon called ""DataDrive""

dubbleclick it and type in the drive which you installed the game on.

with Daemon tools i installed it with G:, so i put G: as the value data.


----------

This will start the game for you and you will be able to play it but you will not make it further then the first disc, cause after that there are problems which i am unable to overcome and no one on the internet seam to have a solution for it, at least none on the forums which i have read.


im just waiting to see if there is a ""saviour"" among TPB

,CyberTootie,2006-04-21T19:31Z,"This torrent does indeed include a playable Final Fantasy VIII for the PC. A few things to note, though:

There were 2 versions of the 1.12 FF8PC patch released by EA. One for NVidia GeForce users and one for non-GeForce users. This torrent includes the patch for GeForce users, but the crack it contains is for a FF8 installation updated to 1.12 via the non-GeForce patch.

There are a few high-resolution videos near the end of disc 1 which are corrupt, consequently causing the game to crash. This can be remedied by setting the Video Resolution option to ""Low"" for the remainder of disc 1."
