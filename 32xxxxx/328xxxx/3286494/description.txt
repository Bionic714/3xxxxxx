  Game Information:
  
  Flashpoint Germany brings you back to the height of the Cold War, before the
  collapse of the Soviet Union. Massive armies of incredible power face off
  across the West German border. A single decision, a mere moment separated a 
  tense peace from the most intense and possibly the last war that the world
  would ever behold. The stakes could not possibly be higher. You may think you
  know how this ends, but in Flashpoint Germany™, it turned out differently.
  Step into the maelstrom, choose your side and see what you would have done,
  if you were there.
  
  Flashpoint Germany portrays the highest intensity and density potential
  combat in human history – the Central Front of a NATO vs. Warsaw Pact World
  War III. As the General in charge of a regiment or brigade, you give the
  orders and let the staff sweat the details. Electronic warfare, tactical
  doctrine, nuclear and chemical weapons, air strikes, artillery, smoke and 
  minefields are all represented, along with a complete database of accurate
  equipment and unit types.
