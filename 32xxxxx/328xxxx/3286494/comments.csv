,hakkapalle,2005-02-10T18:44Z,"Maybe I should make this into a quizz... following text comes from the .nfo file that came with the file, except for the notice-enhancing ***'s.

  1. Unrar.
  2. Burn or mount the image with daemon tools     
  3. *******Install the game by running *******irsetup.exe********** do not run the big installer, it
     will not accept the serials**********. 
  4. When prompted for a serial use one of the following:

     rld!-rld!-rld!-59ef
     45c2-3f43-d423-65de
     5caf-5c87-c521-e0ac

  5. Play the game."
