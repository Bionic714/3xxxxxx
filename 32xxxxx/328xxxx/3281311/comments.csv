Og er det noen som kan legge opp Jampack 2 eller 3?"

,mac_davis,2007-01-07T04:28Z,"Absolutely terrible torrent, it has been weeks with a download rate of less than 4 KB/s. I'm cancelling"
,limepile,2007-05-19T12:38Z,"Its a long road but you can use these on a pc. Nero will play .aiff files, use sound forge or another audio editing suite to capture these to wav. Riverpast audio converter will turn the files into wav also, but as i haven't used it yet i don't know if it will batch convert. good luck."
,bakerconspiracy,2007-06-28T11:39Z,Does this software require any serials or anything not included in the package?

,eXXo23,2011-11-25T09:42Z,I don't know who was complaining about the torrent. I get fair DL speed about 200 kb/s considering that I'm downloading from 3 seeders only. As soon as I download I'll keep seeding.
,Clockface59,2012-04-25T10:43Z,"I've downloaded and installed the Jam Pack.  But during installation an error message saying ""something has happened"" pops up.

After closing it, installation completes.  The Jam pack doesn't exist on my computer after installation though.

Unless someone claims otherwise, looks like this is a dud."
