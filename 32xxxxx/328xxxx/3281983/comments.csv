,DizzyPoet,2005-01-28T03:53Z,"Excellent CD , going out today and buy it . I had not heard of them before , but I am very impressed . I think in a year or so they'll break out into the big time . 

Great  sound , strong lyrics , it's hard to pick a favorite track off this CD , think I have to go with  "" Shallow "" or "" 3AM ""."
