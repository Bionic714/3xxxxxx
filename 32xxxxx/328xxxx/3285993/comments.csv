,blakzer0,2010-01-02T01:41Z,"The quality is ok. Mostly TV quality rips with all sorts of different encoding. Doesn't matter to much though. This is a great show.

,HellsGayngel,2010-12-14T17:41Z,"From Wikipedia:

Episode titled ""112"" was the unaired episode and this is believed to be the missing episode. It apparently is believed to correspond to an episode featuring Brad Sherwood, Patrick Bristow, Colin Mochrie, and Ryan Stiles It is entirely possible that Show #112 is actually the same episode as Show #8003 or #8015 (from season 8) and that the production number was changed by ABC Family, since both of those episodes feature the same cast (Brad Sherwood and Patrick Bristow in the guest chairs) and are derived from a season one taping (since there is no credit reading).[1]"

,sharpshot94549,2011-10-09T04:00Z,"when burnt to a DVD, about half of these had choppy audio that made the episode unwatchable, but on my computer they are fine. the ones with the titles at the beginning are the bad ones"
,nz77788,2012-03-07T00:03Z,"I want to know WHY THE HELL more than half of the episodes don't play! I simply burned it straight to DVD to watch...episodes 1-2 worked, then 3,4,5 didnt... it kept going on like this! 2/3 of the episodes didn't play!"
,marciojr03,2012-03-17T15:10Z,"I'd really like if someone could upload the seasons and soundtrack of dick figures, a youtube series

Thank you for the attention "
,FillInThe,2012-07-24T15:02Z,"The quality is fucking horrible.

It's like somebody ripped 240p video off Youtube or similar and compressed the video again.

V:0/10
A:3/10"
,Feenixx,2012-08-03T00:55Z,"Quality is as atrocious as some are claiming it is, but it's definitely bad. That being said, it's not like we're talking the show 24 or The X-Files or something equally dark and dramatic that you really need a crisp, clear picture on. The quality here is good enough that you don't miss any of the jokes. 

A-7/10
V-4/10"

,VJoe10Waffle,2012-08-21T00:33Z,"Video: 7/10

In terms of quality it's around 480p, definitely not more or less. Just decent."
