Emmy-nominated Whose Line Is It Anyway? is the first of its kind and a completely unique concept to network television. Host Drew Carey sets the scene, with contributions from the audience, and four talented actors wreak hilarious havoc as they instantly invent unrehearsed skits, games or songs, relying only on their quick wit and improvisational skills. It's true improvisation, so anything can happen â€“ and often does.
<p>
Along with Carey, Emmy-nominated Ryan Stiles (The Drew Carey Show), Colin Mochrie, Emmy winner Wayne Brady and a rotating roster of actor/comedians improvise their way through the half-hour of non-stop laughs. Recurring performers include Greg Proops, Brad Sherwood, Chip Esten and Kathy Greenwood. The Whose Line Is It Anyway? band (comprised of keyboardist Laura Hall, guitarist Linda Taylor and other guest musicians) spontaneously accompanies the performers with a dazzling array of musical styles.

American television's most unique comedy series, Whose Line Is It Anyway? began as a radio program in London in 1988 before co-creators Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson brought the show to television. After the show's first season with British lawyer-turned-comedy writer and host Clive Anderson, Ryan Stiles joined as a performer. That same year the show won the British Academy Award. Canadian actor Colin Mochrie joined as a performer shortly thereafter. Over the next five years, the show won the CableACE Award four times.
