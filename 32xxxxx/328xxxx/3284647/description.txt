Propaganda mot LSD

from the web
The brilliant extra, however, is the drug-educational film that Mr. Vraney has 
included, LSD: Trip or Trap?, a shock drama made to be shown in classrooms. 
I think the use of these awful movies was discontinued decades ago, but in the 
late '60s we high-schoolers were shown one every other week, sometimes in 'special 
assemblies.' Trip dramatizes the horrors of making the wrong choice and using 
restricted substances with a terribly directed and acted drama. It's insulting 
in its obviousness and crude to the point of being propagandistic pornography 
itself.
