,Quetzalcoatl,2005-02-09T19:01Z,"Actually. I have a problem to watch your movies. They play at a too high kbit/s rate in my Windows Media Player.  (Inbetween 1000 - 1500 kbit/s) 

(But this computer is old win 98 and I can't get a newer version of WMP than 7.0)

Therefore the image blurs a lot, mostly all the time. But the girls look good the moments they don't dissolve"
,Redreb,2005-02-09T21:07Z,"Hey Quetzalcoatl !
Try either *Bsplayer* or *VLC player* 
(VLC has built-in-codecs for almost every format out there)
Bsplayer is a much better player than Windows mediaplayer

I think they will do just fine ! "
,badm,2005-02-10T00:39Z,"Redreb i like your stuff...but you always complain at the leechers....it's a fact of life that 95% of people won't reply to your posts and don't really care who put what up. Anyway, keep up the good work. I hate WMV, but i suppose the original format is WMV so no point in complaining ;)"
,Redreb,2005-02-10T03:07Z,"Well i didnÂ´t complain about anything.....i just thought that not so much people where interested in *particular the clips from this site* cause i always monitor my torrents and i found much less traffic with these....

well i guess i canÂ´t be trusting the seeder/leecher statistics

:cool:"
,badm,2005-02-10T15:26Z,"ah...well..some are more popular than others i guess :)
i guess i misread ""stopping with this site"" for stopping with *this* site lol
i guess the people here are intimidated by 20 inch black cocks :P"
