,Newlander,2005-03-08T20:27Z,Hur sjutton gör man för att starta spelet? Vilka filer är det man ska öppna i Scumm? Fattar ingenting!
,Trumad,2005-05-07T10:48Z,"Excellent! These collections are brilliant!

Word of warning - if you don't want MP3s of all the music in the games (OSTs) don't download this. But they're low quality so don't take up much space.

Finally, it works on SCUMMVM. if you dont know what that is look it up on wikipedia. At least it supports different languages..."

,MrWise.dev,2005-07-25T15:43Z,"""If you don't want MP3s of all the music in the games (OSTs) don't download this."" - I dont know about you but my bittorrent client lets me choose what files to download, so if I dont want the OST I can simply de-select it... using bitcomet..."

,Maoxx,2008-10-25T00:19Z,"Whoa. Fy faan vad sentimental jag blir. Kom ihåg när det här kom ut och man satt i veckor och spelade och spelade om. Det var på den tiden laddningstiderna var typ tio minuter och man satt och jonglerade fyrtio disketter, men man brydde sig fan inte för spelen var så jävla roliga. Oh, the times. Fan vad gammal man känner sig.. :)"

,garrenn,2009-07-23T23:00Z,"Okay I'm pretty new with games and REALLY new with SummVM(never used it before in my life.)

I extracted the stuff(at least I think I did.) When it finished it came up with some resource folder and comi.la0, comi.la1 and comi.la2

I have no idea what to do at this point and how to get it to play on ScummVM. If someone could write a DETAILED comment on what to do that would be appreciated."
,sixxflesh,2009-07-29T04:39Z,"You need to download a program to extract files such as Winzip or WinRar. Once extracted take the resulting files and place them in a new folder. Then you'll need to install ScummVM, which comes with this torrent. Once installed open it up and follow the path to your folder in which are the extracted files.  After that your good to go."
,Liatiki,2010-03-09T12:05Z,"Hi,

I did what you guys wrote - I extracted the files into a new folder and tried to add the game in scumm. BUT it says there no game to find. now what? =\"
,ecs15,2011-02-22T07:58Z,"@Liatiki Okay. It took me a bit. But I figured it out. What you do is extract the folder that you can. You will put those files, the files in the folder ""Curse of Monkey Island - PC Soundtrack"" and the files in ""The Curse of Monkey Island (1997)"" all into one folder. Name it something you will remember. Open ScummVM and find the folder that you just created. Do not double click the folder. Instead double-click the button on the lower right of the screen. It says something like ""select this"" or ""choose folder"" or along those lines. It will automatically find the file for the game, and it will start it for you. I am a bit into Act II at the moment, and haven't had any problems. Hope this solves your problem."
