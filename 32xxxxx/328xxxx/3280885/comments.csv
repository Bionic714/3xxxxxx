,DeepSpaceFreelancer,2007-02-10T13:19Z,"This torrent is stuck at 99.8%.
I do not think sombody will seed this.
But as wached some of the clips they are allright.
I'll gues at 99.8% is better than nothing."
,DeepSpaceFreelancer,2007-02-10T15:02Z,"There is other post about this StarTrek season.
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3248743/star.trek.tng.season5.dvdrip
You can find these seasons by searching ""StarTrek TNG"" and you can find the others by searching ""Star Trek TNG Rip"". :-)"
,MacComb,2007-07-05T10:10Z,"Yeap - this torrent is stuck at 99.8% , but there's something you can do to cut your losses. Download  DivFix ( I used http://www.divx-digest.com/software/divfix.html  ),  open the incomplete files (.bc! for example) , check  cut out the bad parts on DivFix and rebuild the file.
It will not only rebuild the index of the avi, as it will also remove the incomplete frames. If the incomplete file was close to 100%, after being fixed in this manner it will play ok in most players (or probably all players). Good luck!"
,albionknight,2008-12-29T11:02Z,Same problem stuck at 99.8.........thank you to all that just hit & run.............not worth downloading if people wont continue to seed
