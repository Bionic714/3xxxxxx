,Ainokami,2006-06-09T01:47Z,Why would you want the dubbed version? It sucks. It's censured and stuff.
,tattooedmermaid,2009-10-17T01:25Z,"Ainokami is right... dubbed stuff totally sucks... its completely censored and the dialogue is totally different... but some people prefer laziness to quality and wont read subtitles...
