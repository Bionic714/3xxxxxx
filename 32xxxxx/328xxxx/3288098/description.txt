The highly-anticipated third chapter in the multi-platinum-
   selling NBA Street series rises above the rim and expands on 
   the customization and variety of game modes and gameplay that
   helps distinguish the franchise within EA's rich basketball
   portfolio. Gamers can build their reputation as they create 
   the future of street basketball with all-new jaw-dropping,
   ankle-breaking, rim-shaking moves in visually stimulating
   environments, from favorite courts like "The Cage" and
   "Rucker Park" to the next generation of streetball sanctuaries,
   like "Venice Beach". It all adds up to give V3 a revolutionary
   style all its own.
