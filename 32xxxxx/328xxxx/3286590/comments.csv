,gurgel,2005-02-07T21:38Z,"It's the latest release and it still works, so why bother about a date?"
,gr8r-x,2005-02-08T09:03Z,"Uh.. Because pretty much ALL of that software is out of date!

Bug fixes, features added, blah, blah, blah.  Personally I'd stay clear of this, it's WAY to old."
,coin,2005-03-02T00:20Z,"I think superdisc still has one of the better tools/interfaces for changing harddrives and other related tasks. 

But for additional xbox applications I would probably look somewhere else indeed.

Consider it a ""Resque disc"" rather than an up-to-date software installer. ;)"
,SNiPER604,2005-03-12T16:33Z,How the hell do I fit it to a cdrw. It is too big.
