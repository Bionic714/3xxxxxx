Adobe Streamline 4.0

Maximum control for converting images to line art
Faster than a tracing hand, able to leap from raster to line art in a single bound, Adobe Streamline 4.0 software instantly converts scanned black-and-white or color raster images into editable Adobe PostScript line art. Just scan any sketch, and Streamline will automatically create a file that you can drag and drop into Adobe Illustrator to complete your design.
