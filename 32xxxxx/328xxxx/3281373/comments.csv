Stephen Chow (1991) Fight Back To School 1

Being a grass-root mainlander in ""All for the Winner"", Stephen Chow steps out from his low-class image and becomes a smart SDU leader in this movie. Flavored with lots of humorous elements, this is claimed to be one of the classic comedies in the 90's. the story is about Star Chow, who uses to be the leader of SDU, goes to a school and be an undercover for a gun-missing case. The story goes with tremendous amount of laughing spots with a surprising and innovative scenario. With excellent combination and vivid performance of the actors, this is the magnum opus of Stephen Chow and the whole comedy movies sector.
