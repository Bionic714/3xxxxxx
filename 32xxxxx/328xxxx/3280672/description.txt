Stiff Little Fingers-The Early Years Video Collection SVCD

OK here's a great collection of Stiff Little Fingers on video, this is comprised mainly of early footage from the 70's and early 80's. This is a 3xcd download but worth it , enjoy!

***The Off The Record 82 is of a low quality, it's in colour and the sounds great but lower than i would normally post but is ridiculously rare so i included it. The 2 extra tracks from Belfast 80 are also low quality but just as ridiculously rare so thats why i included them, also they are both stunning versions.

Everything else is great or good quality. The Soth Bank Show has subtitles because it came from a Swedish TV Channels vaults***
