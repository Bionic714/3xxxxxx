My 1st gig was SLF 1983 Glasgow Apollo.
I was 14, very drunk, & they played 2.5 hours.

These videos bring back a lot of memories. I wanted to ask if anyone knows if Barbed Wire Love (Aylesbury 1980) and Gotta Getaway (Aylesbury 1980) from CD1 are the versions from ""Hanx!"" They sound the same and I know most of that album was recorded at Aylesbury in 1980. By the way, you can fix the sync problem with that Barbed Wire Love clip by watching it with VLC Player, going to Tools > Track Synchronization and advancing the audio over video by -.4 secs. Of course, you are advancing the video over the audio this way. Anyway to bandit999 and all other seeders: HANX!"
,pmsfo,2010-03-24T06:33Z,"An add-on to the last comment: further evidence that Barbed Wire Love (Aylesbury 1980) and Gotta Getaway (Aylesbury 1980) from CD1 are the versions from ""Hanx!"" -- they all seem to be wearing the same clothes as shown on the cover of ""Hanx!,"" including Henry Cluney in the Marc Bolan shirt...man...I just realized...I gotta get a life. Or should I say I Gotta Getaway. Well we'll just have to Wait and See if I will have a Wasted Life. ha ha ha does anyone read these comments...probably not."
