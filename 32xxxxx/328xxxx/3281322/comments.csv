I have a problem however. I get an error message that reads: ""got bad file info - path disallowed for security reasons"" and the download fails.

Anyone else have the same problem?

,DogshitTaco,2005-01-27T23:19Z,"Have you tried with another client?
Do all of you use the same client?

About burning, i tried it on a Princo 4x -R in Nero, and it worked fine."

,patoalexis38,2005-03-07T13:21Z,"Hi,

Do you do not need DS9! only ""DvD Shrink 3.2"" and delete samething (like german or other language) and you will be able to burn it.

Good luck!!!!!!!"
