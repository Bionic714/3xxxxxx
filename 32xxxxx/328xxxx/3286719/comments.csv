,Karras,2005-02-08T08:45Z,Tycker nog också att 6:an är bättre än 5:an!

,TigerDiamond,2005-03-23T14:55Z,Har også problem med release.cab...
,TigerDiamond,2005-03-23T15:30Z,"Duen: Viss du ikke har funnet ut av det enda; kopier alt fra begge CDene til samme hovedmappe. :) Funker fint, da."
,memin,2005-03-25T03:59Z,"Help!!!!

chhheeeerrrsss!!!!!!!"
,TigerDiamond,2005-03-25T12:31Z,What I said above; you can install from the HD if you put all the files/folders from the two CDs in the same parent folder.
,denns,2005-06-05T13:45Z,fan vad det laggar....

,ladislaus74,2006-02-04T10:37Z,"please seed !
thanks !"
,made-of-technetium,2006-02-09T13:20Z,"Works fine for me putting both discs in 1 folder.
There may be 2 data folders but no conflicting files in them so just put all the contents in 1 data folder."
,Gooxen,2006-03-15T08:28Z,"tycker såhär.. första spelen är bäst för det är 'äkta vara' men som äventyrare gillar jag dessa mer, det är mer leta i senare spelen skulle dock vara kul med flera laras house saker ;)"
,doofus123,2006-04-26T19:07Z,Is this game in english?
,avseq,2006-11-04T21:02Z,"Please seed dudes !

,newbieh,2007-01-03T19:00Z,"Please seed,im trying to download it for my girlfriend who would like this game very much... ill make sure she keeps seeding afterwards!

,tearsinrain,2007-01-05T02:12Z,hur gör jag för att bränna detta spel till cd och installera det från cd?
,Chwilami,2007-04-26T00:31Z,"""Windows illegal operation occured"" or ""program executed illegal operation"" I don't know how it is in english, cause I have polish windows...  Doesn't matter what  I set in setup... HELP ! !"
,Brice3010,2007-05-01T09:21Z,"If you burn these files to 2 separate cd's (I used Nero) it will NOT work: the second cd is not recognised by the installer. Instead combine both cd's of the download in one folder; for the data, combine data; inside data you have Audio and Maps, there you combine as well. It is a bit manual work, but it is the only way to get this installed.

It would have been much more professional to upload 2 images instead of this cd copy."
,seedaren (bra dator),2007-06-19T20:15Z,"euhm, alla som har testat den nyaste Tomb Raider.. borde veta att den e de mest roligaste tomb raider spelet, men också den mest buggiga... ja hoppade i luften en gång, hon stannade och flög om kring ett tag, sen fastnade ja i en vägg... så denna är nog lite bättre!!

,Marcus101RR,2008-06-06T17:59Z,"Forget this crappy version of AOD, I am going to upload the DVD version."
,borzy86,2008-06-26T14:28Z,"There is a solution for problem ""release.cab""!!
Before starting, uninstall AOD, delete all the left over folders and clear your TEMP folder!

   1. Create a new folder on your hard disc.
   2. Copy all the contents from CD1 to that folder.
   3. Copy all from CD2 into that same folder except the DATA which you put in a subfolder.
   4. Start the installation with the install.exe (the one you copied onto your hard disc).
   5. When you get the 'Can't find data folder' error minimalize the error window, copy and replace the DATA (from CD2) over your first folder.
    6. Launch the install.exe again by choosing TRY AGAIN, and the installment will finish without a problem."
,-Jewel-,2008-07-28T21:24Z,"If followed the instructions of Borzy86 too, the game installed perfectly and worked ok too. "

,Hammerman44,2009-04-06T17:54Z,I have made a DVD ISO and added 3 patches to it down load from here. Easy installation. Patches V42 & v52 have to be installed after game is installed or it won't run on some machines. HTTP://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4827391/Tomb_Raider_Angel_of_Darkness_ISO
,Rockeymaru94,2009-06-03T09:04Z,I don't get it. what disc?

,susscon,2009-06-25T17:55Z,"i have no start menu after the game intro, but just press enter and the game starts, then it works untill lara falls and dies then im stuck on a title screen i cant see to restart the game.
i see save and load, but it looks like a shadow in the background, when i try and select either, i here the select tone, but save and load does not get highlighted....
anyone else have this problem? or anyone have solutions to it?

p.s. my system spec is high enough to run this game at full settings, so i dont want people telling me its my G-card - CPU - or any of that bollocks...

thanx for the rip, but this time its a ''dont work'' for me. "
,michelangelina54,2011-11-24T10:59Z,"Hey there! I followed Borzy's instructions and at the end of the installation the program says ""error 14!""
After I launch the program it works but the inventory does not show up and if lara picks up a veapon she cannot draw it out and basically I cannot use anything she picks up...Please help! What should I do?"
