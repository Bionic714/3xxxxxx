,MickDagger,2006-02-24T10:51Z,"why would you download this from an insecure source?  it's available free directly from sun.com, you fools."
,legrimpeur,2006-08-02T11:40Z,"MIckDagger, thanks for your comment. Actually this 
torrent was motivated by the fact that at the time it was relased by sun downloading from their server was a pain in the ass and took me a lot of patience and time. Anyway to check the integrity of the downloads ou can download md5 sums from sun an compare, as easy as that..."
