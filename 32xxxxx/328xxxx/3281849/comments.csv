Looks fine."
,Sonny06,2005-01-27T17:02Z,"@Theobal: That torrent file is old, something was wrong with it. Sorry for that mate, but if you donwload this new one i think you should be able to save into the same directory, so you wont have to donwload it all those 79% again...
Again, sorry but this new torrent file seems to work fine."
