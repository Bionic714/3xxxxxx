,Gyokuran,2005-03-15T13:05Z,Thanks! Could you put that in lossless-format (like e.g. FLAC) as well?
[T],naxosking,2007-01-13T22:51Z,I didn't know that Barber had a long homosexual affair with composer Menotti. Reading a biography of him right now that is very interesting. Sheds a lot of light on his music. I think his Violin Concerto is his best work. What do you all think?
,mitteget,2008-05-03T00:33Z,Of what I've heard (and it's not that much) the violin concerto is his supreme opus.
,rogerpP,2008-08-27T16:23Z,"Many thanks - Barber is ok, well worth a place in the library."
,El__Jefe,2010-03-20T02:19Z,Much obliged
