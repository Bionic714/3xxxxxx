,blemishednicely,2007-11-18T09:53Z,"How do you get this game to run? It looks really cool & I'd like to play. got the torrent, the key code to run it is fine, it's on my computer like a regular game should be for menu options, accessibility and such, the patch or auto-update even ran sweet, but every time I mount anything (tried all config's I conceived) in Daemon it runs the menu but ""play"" brings up notice requiring disc in drive. Do I need to burn something to disc off of here or what?"
