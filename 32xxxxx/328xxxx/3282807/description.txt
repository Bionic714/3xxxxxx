CableNut is a tool for optimizing your Internet Connection. We have provided a way to tweak any option you may want to in the adjuster. You can load "CableNut Custom Setting" files that are included with the program to tweak your Internet connection. 

You can make your own "CableNut Custom Setting" files save them for later use, or distribute them to anyone with the CableNut program. Dialup, Cable, DSL, and Satellite connections are supported out of the box. If you don't have one of the supported connection types don't worry you can visit the site, and ask the CableNut team for help. Best of all it is freeware. We don't haggle you with annoying advertisments, banners, time limits, or restrictions. 

Just remember that we developed this application to make your Internet go faster, that is what we wanted. This software will support any connection type, and it does work with Windows 98ME2000XP!
