,Cozworth,2005-02-16T18:07Z,"Sorry for the english but is there any chance that someone could extract the fitness routines into induhvidual ones.

As I still live in the dark ages I tried to download this and couldn't extract it as I run FAT32. D'oh. Either that an AVI file would be really cool.

Either way thanks for the torrent, its nice to know that other like Taebo as well."

,boyscript,2005-07-05T05:32Z,i dled this awhile ago. good qulity(dvd rip) but you better be corddinated for this. involves several movements at one time.
,Jeivel,2006-07-04T22:46Z,"Ok guys I relly need your help. After the download, all I see is a group of blank files so I figured I had to make it all into a ISO. So i used Magic ISO and made an ISO of it.

After, I used DVDDecrypter and decrypted it. But even if I mount the ISO, all that pops up is the map. I can't open it with any DVD emulator I have, not even VLC player. please! Help me!!"
,ruffrichie,2006-07-06T19:17Z,@Jeivel: looks to be in a spanned .rar archive. You need winrar to open it.
,Jeivel,2006-07-07T15:21Z,"wow I tried opening the files with every program but WinRAR xD *dooh* But lookie there, found it! ^^ 

Many thanks to you ruffrichie! :D"

,garraty,2007-01-12T16:26Z,"Hi guys,

on behalf of my wife I want to thank you for this incredible torrent. I saw some of you had problems with the file and more precisely how to use it. It is really simple. You need to have winrar program. In these 49 MB files there is a 4GB iso file. You should extract that iso file to any folder with enough space on it. Then load the iso to any image reading program such as DAEMON TOOLS or alcohol 120% (for me DAEMON TOOLS worked pretty fine). That's all! :-D Have fun!!!"
,cute_erick14344,2007-10-04T23:39Z,guys can you help me with this one? I have tried everything but I couldn't open it... Can you please provide an easier way on how to open the file? thanks...
,roc69x,2008-02-16T02:10Z,NTSC or Pal. Got a shitty DVD player that plays only NTSC.
,Pucciny,2008-04-06T18:24Z,Guys i tried out to double click on first blank file...and after few seconds it didn`t know how to open it....then I pressed to open it with WinRAR and then it shows me an ISO file...press right mouse button and choose extract to specified folder...IT WORKS...It`s extracting now..I`ll write down my experience with burning after this...
,jewthedad123,2008-08-28T17:39Z,"It's realy simple all you do is Double click the first file and choose WinRar or WinZip to open.
  Extract this anywhere. It contains the .iso file   4.5gig.  To burn use any IMG or ISO burning Software.
I used IMGburn that I got from www.oldversion.com and it works GREAT.   I hope this helps everyone"
,3leggedfreak,2008-11-10T10:17Z,I think the file has been splittet in to smaller peaces by using hj-split prog. Download the prog and use it to combine the peaces. (and i know the word pieces)
,aliver,2009-03-17T13:24Z,"hi,
I use total commander or can use hj-split . This file is choped - the original is ISO . "
,smiffo99,2010-02-12T14:51Z,"isnt it obvious? they are RAR FILES, just extract the FIRST RAR FILE and lwt WINRAR DO THE REST.
they will all be axtracted into one DVD IMAGE FILE.
use DVD SHRINK or VSO COPY TO DVD or any simlar software to burn this extractyed image.
people sound so dumb! if you have no idea about downloaded torrent file types then why on earth trouble your own little minds by downloading in the first place?
seems people only have no idea about computers!"
