,woowow,2008-05-26T15:01Z,"Ahhh, I got a message saying that this version of Windows doesn't support this product (I'm using Vista). Any help?"
,Loske,2008-07-06T14:59Z,The unoficial patch;-)
,skarekrow,2008-07-14T15:22Z,why does it say that i need atleast 20mb of free diskspace to play when i have several gb of free diskspace? and why did it tell me i only had 2gb free on c: when i have atleast 20? weird....
,WeedyPirate,2008-07-18T14:03Z,"Getting the error- ""Not enough free hard disk space. Fallout requires at least 20.0 megabytes of free hard disk space"". 

While i've got at least 30g free... odd. Any ideas?
Cheers"
,schism1861,2008-07-25T18:34Z,"if you're having problems running the game (like getting the not enough memory error) go here http://www.teamx.ru/eng/files/f1patch.shtml 
install those patches and you should be good to go"
,Axnor,2008-07-28T11:12Z,"schism1861, thanks, you're a real life saver"
,s.fuzzo,2008-08-20T04:21Z,"I got the game, installed both patches, and it ran fine for two days. Now I'm getting the ""not enough free space"" error. What the hell? I'll try installing the patches (again), but this seems ridiculous."
,TheRyan,2008-09-02T22:23Z,"I got the disk space error when I tried to run it on Vista. Try running it in compatibility mode for XP (right click, properties, compatibility, Run this program in compatibility mode for: Windows XP). Worked for me."
,neohex,2008-10-05T09:01Z,Putting it in Windows 98 compatibility mode helped me get past that bad disk space error. 
,zero_inspiration,2008-10-25T11:38Z,"Ok, so I'm trying to install, and it's telling me I only have 66 MB of space on my hard drive. Needless to say, I have WAY more space than that. WTF? I've tried compatibility mode, no effect. Am I actually going to have to do the minimum size install on this?"
,Ted_Ninja,2008-11-01T21:23Z,"I got an error recently when trying to install this. Not a disk space error but possibly worse: The installer (which looks like it was designed for windows 95) freezes and blacks out when I click next after selecting the install directory (which happens to be a portable HDD I never NEVER use the C:/ drive)

alt-tab is the only way of getting it to clear. I have gone to make a sandwhich and come back and nothing ever changed. I assume it is either my OS and the installer not liking one another or there is a fatal flaw in the installer from this torrent."
,mrnooby,2008-11-04T03:26Z,HELLO EVERY1 PLEASE HELP!!! i installed this and cant figure out how to open the mdf files please tell me step by step how to do it! THANK YOU!!!
,sportingwood,2008-11-06T05:39Z,"Nero doesn't recognize this file type so I burned it to disk with ImgBurn, but I'm sure other programs can burn/mount it as well. Install was a little buggy, it seemed to hang the first time I tried it but on the second attempt it worked, I used the largest install. So far it's playing just fine running Windows XP Media on an NTFS drive, no need for compatibility mode or DOS emulators or anything like that. One thing - the link to the patch for this version found earlier in the comments is dead.....anybody know where/if it can be found?

Thanks for uploading & sharing."
,BuLTeN_SwE,2008-11-15T11:04Z,"i've played fallout 2, tactics and the third (which from my opinion sucked) but a havent played the first yet... looking forward to it."
,TALLPANZER,2008-11-20T16:14Z,"Ok, I am having the same problem as Ted_Ninja. Can someone please explain what Epahim said. My windows XP dose not have a program called Explore."
,accog,2008-12-04T06:44Z,If your having trouble with compatibility try going to the .exe properties and change the compatibility mode. Im sure Win95 would work fine
,natranr,2008-12-07T02:28Z,I don't understand? you all are getting speeds well over 100Kb/s and im only getting 20kb/s. any one else have this problem? it's so slow even with over 52 seeds.

,bigshurup,2009-02-22T04:15Z,"If your screen blacks out when you try to install, go to the root folder on your CD drive and run _SETUP.EXE (not the SETUP.EXE).

If the game complains that you need at least 20MB of free disk space, go to the installation folder, find the FALLOUT.CFG file, open it with your Notepad and find the line free_space=20480 and change the value to 0 (zerro). Save and exit."
,marxm,2009-04-17T05:30Z,200+ dl speed.  Awesome torrent will seed to >1

,elektronik_supersonik,2010-10-09T19:33Z,"Cool, thanks a lot!"
,elektronik_supersonik,2010-10-09T22:43Z,"For people with the black screen problem (and messed up colors with Windows 7):

copy the following code into a text editor and save it as fallout.bat in the game directory:

@echo off
taskkill /f /IM explorer.exe
start fo1_screen_refresh.exe
falloutw.exe
taskkill /f /IM fo1_screen_refresh.exe
start explorer.exe

Download this file and extract it into the game directory:
http://www.labo-asso.com/download/fo1_screen_refresh.zip

Change the game's shortcut to point into this file instead of falloutw.exe. It'll work like a charm and it'll solve the messed up colors with Windows 7, too. It does, however, shut down Explorer and thus close all your open folders, so be sure to acknowledge that. Explorer will restart after you quit the game.

P.S. Don't click on OK in the beginning (although it's unlikely you'll be quick enough :)"

after installing the game make the .bat file as elektronik_supersonik said above but RUN IT first before running the fo1_screen_refresh.exe."
,Barroquecore,2011-08-31T11:20Z,Works excellent on Vista 64bit. Used to have a thing where the screen would suddenly turn black and then just clear where parts changed or you put your mouse. I haven't got it after the scorpion cave so it's all good. Thanks!

,xXxTWxXx,2012-06-05T21:22Z,"Haven't used this torrent before. I used to have the entire fallout collection: ""FO1, FO2, FO Tactics"" years ago. I lent the CDs to my brother, this was in 2002.. Before that nobody else had uploaded these games, atleast that I could find on this site and the similar ones.. It's good to see that there are a few torrents to choose between nowadays.

Anyway, Ima try this one out. Thx4upload/seed"
,xXxTWxXx,2012-06-06T00:12Z,"Hmm.. Encountered a problem I have never encountered before... The game works properly.. 'xcept.. Once I get through the cave (Vault 13).. And enter the map. And walk through the map. The time seems to pass really quickly.. But I'm not moving quickly.. It lets me pass about 4 squares on the map. Then it says the time run out. Like, the waterchip quest has run out of time and I lose the game... Funky error.

I tried updating the game with the latest official patch. But no difference. I used my own created character. Now, when I think about it. It might be because I used Falche and edited my character. I shall try with a fresh character."
