Great movie by the way. A classic spy thriller."

Tror LÄTT det var den snyggaste releasen här...  *beröm i mängder*"
,lagavulin69,2005-02-13T21:34Z,Tack för denna!!! Mycket snygg release...
,mercuryr3,2005-02-13T22:18Z,Vackert. Härligt att lite gamla klassiker får utrymme bland 0-day skräpet. Snygg pitch också. Tummen upp.

,mad_pawn,2008-04-02T23:06Z,Does anyone else have checksum errors?
,wackywolf,2008-06-18T13:09Z,"Thanks for upload. I have problems with menu system and the film freezes. Extracted and mounted img with Daemon Tools and played from there with VLC and MPC- same thing. Burnt Video TS (from Daemon) to DVD and played in DVD-player- still problems. 
I see 18 comments and no problems- others have problems???
Did check dl with ""control again"" under Azureus, maybe img doesn`t work with Daemon, and I should burn img directly to disk? Suggestions???"
