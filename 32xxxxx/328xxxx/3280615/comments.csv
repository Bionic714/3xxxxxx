Ok he did a pritty good job considering ... but why??

,mathsped,2005-02-19T14:11Z,"Well, it says in the info that's it a AVI-DVD, so hence the crappy quality. I also made the mistake to download it, but luckily I didn't waste a DVD on it as a preview showed it was a crappy release :-)  Hint: Don't download this unless you're into bad quality."
