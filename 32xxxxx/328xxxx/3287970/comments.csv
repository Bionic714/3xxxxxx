1. Är ni intresserade av att ha 1280x720p encodes i XviD?

2. Skulle ni vilja ha extramaterial som finns i dvdn? (Outtakes, Trailers, TV Spots, Deleted Scenes etc...)

Det gäller alla filmer som jag ska rippa/encoda senare inklusive The Texas Chainsaw Massacre!

,zx48,2005-02-10T10:44Z,"hi!
would it be possible for you to share the original DVD? i've downloaded the PAL DVD version of this great movie from this tracker, but the picture is really bad - totally screwed up conversion from NTSC (film) to PAL i think - so i'd really appreciate the NTSC version on DVD;-) thanks!

,zx48,2005-02-10T10:46Z,p.s.or would it be possible to make 2CD rip in full DVD res. with some high quality custom matrix (didee's 6of9 for example (www.doom9.org))?
,Ankokuu,2005-02-10T12:47Z,"Dear zx48

I'm mainly an anime encoder but I will definitely take a look at custom matrix for movies, especially dideés as he is my favorite avisynth developer ;-)

The resolution on the dvd is letterboxed and I hate that format but I'm thinking of going for Hidef (1280x720) what do you think of that?

I would've loved to share the dvd but I'm on a 1MBit non-duplex connection :("
,zx48,2005-02-10T13:43Z,"thanks for your quick answer:-)
and yes, didee's the best:-D
i don't know, whether it's a good idea to make HD rip from such source - you know, some editions of movies like e.g. terminator 2, or recently total recall had HD version in WMV on bonus disc, so a rip made from such source would be great, but is there anything to gain just by resizing standard D1 (?) source?

Anyways, it's a good rip. Nice movie to watch :)"
,legumo,2008-01-01T13:20Z,"doesn't look really like a dvd.....more like a VHSRIP, there is various interlace, side brightness and cropped things at the very beginning.

the quality is ok in the movie but it doesnt really look dvdrip at all. :\

could've been done better. 

tahnks anway"
