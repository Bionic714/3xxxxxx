New discs aveilible nowadays is mighty large. A 300GB disc stores no less than 500h or apr, 7.500 tracks of pure music in highest possible quality. Worth a thaught? I think so.
For what it's worth, I'm irritated on upploaded torrents for music at tiny 128k. This is not CD quality, whatever som people might say. Nevertheless, most music prigrams used to ripp rekomeds 128k to be CD quality. Pity.
I have upploaded som music torrents myself, all at no less though than 320k.
However, the music stord so far leavs untoutched.
Keep up the good work boys and girls."
