„eXeem Lite“ is a modification of eXeem which does not contains any spyware or adware (CyDoor blocked by HOSTS). The toolbar installation has been removed and a new useful start page was added with lots of information and links about eXeem. eXeem Lite is also available in other languages (www.exlite.pl) ! 
"eXeem" is a new Peer-To-Peer program, which uses a similar download and upload component as BitTorrent (libtorrent). eXeem removes the need for a tracker and it features its own Peer-To-Peer network. eXeem also does not share your whole folder, but only the files that you published to the network.
