,ari2asem,2005-02-10T01:03Z,"is there any difference between these release and the next release: http://www.piratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3287730&hit=1 (Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II). the second release are RAR archive's, this release are BIN and CUE files.  i think posting 2 different torrents for one major game release is not good, because u get users divided in 2 parts, 1 part is downloading  the first release while group 2 is downloading second torrent. wouldn't be better to join all these users or downloaders under one torrent so that u got much faster download? maybe this idea is not  meant only for this specific game release, but i am also talking about other release with the same situation."
