Their second album. This time a lot more mellow, of course with a
few exceptions (Weather report). A very beutiful album which ranges
from lovely ballads to country, blues and hard-rock. 
This is a CD-rip, but it must be a bootleg-CD. Probably somebody
who have made a vinyl-rip...
However, the sound is OK but it's not excellent.
I put a bonus track on this myself. The last song "Steamhouse". I've
ripped this myself from a vinyl single released in 1972.  The B-side is a 
song from this LP.
They have a different drummer than on the first LP. Ken Gudman who
is probably quite well-known in Denmark.
