I still would like them to use the torrentsystem instead of the eDonkey system.

Thanks for this!"
,gullfisk,2005-02-03T14:40Z,DAP-central? what is that?
,flumma,2005-02-03T18:19Z,"dapcentral.org is a group of people that have been transferring all of these lovely episodes of MST3K, and other shows as well, from old VHS-tapes into digital media. They are the reason all these non-commercial episodes are available on the internet. Go support them in any way you can :)"

Tack, tack"
