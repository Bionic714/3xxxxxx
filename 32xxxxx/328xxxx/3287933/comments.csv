,NOBBY_UK,2005-02-11T02:55Z,"Just me :d
2 pass Xvid comes out fairly well.

It is for people like me - who do not download
multi-disc stuff."
,TiNVeL,2005-02-20T15:38Z,"Great rip, thanks for seeding."
,azayaka,2005-05-10T22:05Z,"this is a great rip! thanks to the guy whoever rip this movie!

i still dont believe it 2:20 hours movie can fit into 700MB....but believe me...its true ^^

700MB doesnt mean the picture and sound is lame, this one is rocks! 

again...thank u so much to the guy who made this :p"
,JayArgo,2006-12-29T00:55Z,"For a 700mb rip, this is really good quality (even has the credits). Thanks a lot for seeing this: great film and great copy :)"

,fula-nito,2007-08-19T19:15Z,Can some1 tell me if this is a DVDrip??? thanks!!!
,omermajoka,2008-01-23T06:12Z,seed plz
,PowerTorsk,2008-04-10T18:41Z,"It's only 699 MB because its 32 000 Hz sound. Normally, it's 44 000. (More detailed sound, the higher value.)

It doesn't really matter in movies, but if it was music, that wouldn't be an option."
,Newbie_X,2008-05-02T18:21Z,"Hey, thanks for the upload. This is how it should be !

,Laen,2009-01-14T04:06Z,"Just watched the whole thing, no problems. Sound quality was good, always in sync with the video, and actions definitely weren't ""too fast"". My friend is very picky about sound and didn't notice anything either. Really happy with the torrent, thanks."
,Amethyzt,2009-07-19T10:06Z,"love the comments on this one, and love my fellow seeding pirates"

,zeinabqureshi,2009-12-30T19:25Z,"@Nobby,
I'm a great fan of yours, and, when it's your upload, we can be sure of the quality. Like it the way you do, ""people like me who don't like multi-disc stuff."" Well said! And thanks many!"
,hkhan4u,2010-03-11T10:18Z,"The video quality no good..pixeleted video.
I amazed how ppl say that it is good quality rip.....?
I don't like the video quality."
,JuJuBeii,2010-04-06T04:25Z,"Sound and video quality were both good. NTSC/PAL Charlie Foxtrot?????? Signalboy, you are a TOTAL TOOL. Find something better to do with your time."
,macman104,2010-04-10T08:05Z,"Agreed, 'preciate the upload, but not great quality like suggested in the comments, too pixelated for me too watch"
