Smoking with heated aggression that
raises the fahrenheit, is The Offenders' incredible Endless Struggle
album. This platter is third degree burns, it's a speed venture with
a no holds barred power approach that rips the melting flesh. At first
listen, comparisons go towards MDC or Suicidal Tendencies, but The
Offenders shine through punch after punch, delivering a hearty ensemble
of goods and pure energy. A well-recorded effort that should bring them
to the threshold. This captures all the right moves. Blasting vocals
bellows, rapid, grinding guitar work, throbbing bass jams and quick
plunges make it all come together as the vinyl spins and the music flies
into the atmosphere at a furious rate. Potentially a release to please
with 13 high adrenalin tracks, AAAHHH, The Offenders at their finest.
