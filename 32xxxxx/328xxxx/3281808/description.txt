Transworld Snowboarding

Released in 2002 this game might be a bit old, but is in my opinion the best snowboarding game out there! With better controls than SSX3 and Amped 2, this game has a vast arsenal of tricks. Off-piste? If there's a downhill, you can ride it.

Stunning graphics, easy-to-learn, precise controls and variety in music makes this game one of the most entertaining extreme sports-game on the market.

Just try it!
