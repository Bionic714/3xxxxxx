,johnfernstro,2005-01-23T22:20Z,"Thinking of uploading the album ""Caught in the act"", live  album from 1975. Any tips on how I best can rip the tracks from a cd? Software, bitrate and all other crap I need 2 know? Ohh, almost forgot, great uplad, thanks."
,KingStar,2005-01-24T00:01Z,"Yeah, I'm a fan of Grand Funk from way back!

I use CDEx in WinDoz for ripping mp3s. I usually use 320 Kbs CBR for my rips. I use Grip in Linux with the same settings, 320 Kbs and CTR.

I'm sure there are a lot of rippers out there and they all have their plusses and minuses but those two are what I use.
