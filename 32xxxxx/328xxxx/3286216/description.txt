Featuring 136 club teams and 57 national teams, Winning Eleven 8 
       offers gamers control of up to 4,500 of the world's greatest 
       soccer players. The inclusion of licensed leagues is a huge step 
       forward for the series, with player likenesses, names and official 
       kits, bolstering what is already considered the most advanced and 
       realistic soccer game to date. 

       The world's biggest stars are brought to life through photo 
       realistic graphics and authentically modeled features, as well as 
       individual styles of play, movement and ball control. 
       Additionally, the game introduces a wealth of new moves and tricks 
       including new free kick and penalty kick techniques, an innovative 
       indirect free kick move and a new dribbling system that offers 
       more control as gamers go one-on-one against opposing players. 
       Teaming up with these new features will be more advanced player 
       stats that govern every aspect of their play, including how well 
       players can bring a ball under control, hit it past an encroaching 
       defender or flick it to a teammate. 

       Further adding to the excitement of the game, Winning Eleven 8 
       also features the first-ever on-screen referee in the history of 
       the series. Boasting an enhanced ref AI, the referee will run up 
       and down the field reacting realistically and instinctively to 
       fouls, giving advantage for minor infringements and even stepping 
       in to calm things down when the action gets heated.
