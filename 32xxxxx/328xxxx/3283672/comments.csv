,zoner81,2005-03-31T23:54Z,"Hey, heres an idea!!! Instead of complaining. DOWNLOAD ANOTHER CRACK!!!!
How hard can it be???? My god... You should be happy that anybody even whants to upload stuff here on TPB with all the complaints... Just because it doesnt work for you!! It worked for me, and all i did whas take 1 minute of my time to download another crack. Oh my god whas that hard (sarkasm)
Word of advise! Try uploading something for yourself before you complain...
