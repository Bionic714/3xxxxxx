,hotpussy,2005-03-05T16:13Z,"this advertised english subtitles but when i downloaded it all the sub files render only into korean [or some other character language which i cannot identify]. in other words, no english"
,hotpussy,2005-03-05T18:23Z,please disregard the above. it was the player i was using that would not play the english subtitles. bsplayer works. media player classic does not.
,Mr_Modern,2005-03-21T15:45Z,"INFORMATION TO ALL GOOD CITIZENS:

Perhaps you'll find that bsplayer can't use the english subs either. Fear not, you can use the VLC playa from videolan! 

Appearently this is a wicked yellow sub, which contains both english AND some nasty asian language! In VLC, there's a setting that allows you to chose which sub in the wicked mothersub that you want to use, thus creating a blance between light and the dark forces of the Sith that shall forever be in_your_PrAIsEs Forevar!
