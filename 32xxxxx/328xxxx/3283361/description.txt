Reseed because of dead tracker, now with multiple trackers, so it should work properly now.

Winds is a classical/symphonic, progressive avant-garde metal band from Norway. Hellhammer and Tideman are amazing musicians and they've got an original and refreshing sound. Top notch compositions and solos, almost scary perfection. Only the vocals could be better. Their releases always get a 9 or 10 out of 10, so be sure to check this out and enjoyâ€¦
