If you cant view this try downloading VLC media player. it plays most films."
,asuri13,2009-03-21T18:24Z,Please seed..
,royskatt,2009-04-04T20:41Z,"Load subs through your menu on your mediaplayer (VLC is recommended - plays ""everything"")

You can also re-name the subfile you want to use, excactly same name as the .avi-file (do not change file-typ, keep .srt unchanged). Then will most mediaplayers recognize the sub you want to use, automaticly.

In VLC (maybe other also) you can also ""drag and drop"" the subfile onto the screen when playing the movi, and they will work fine."
