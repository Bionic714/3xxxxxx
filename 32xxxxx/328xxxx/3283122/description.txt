P L O T L i N E 
A woman named Grace retires with her two children 
to a mansion on Jersey, towards the end of the Second
World War, where she's waiting for her husband to 
come back from battle. The children have a disease 
which means they cannot be touched by direct sunlight
without being hurt in some way. They will live alone
there with oppressive, strange and almost religious 
rules, until she needs to hire a group of servants 
for them. Their arrival will accidentally begin to 
break the rules with unexpected consequences.

Observe: I am only able to seed between 06:30 to 22:00, SS is naturally on, so no stupid questions about why there are no seeders or if I-m super-seeding, my upload is 0,8 so it will take at least 24 hrs to dl "the Others"

If you are looking for a film, please do not be afraid to ask me, I might have it...
Enjoy! Aqueritas
