Nintendo 64 and Playstation Emulation for Xbox is not always done at an acceptable speed. And most of the Xbox versions are quite buggy. So i recommend downloading one of the ""Emulator + Roms for Xbox"" packages, as they're configured for  the Xbox as good as it's possible (and the Roms are carefully selected for maximum compability)."
