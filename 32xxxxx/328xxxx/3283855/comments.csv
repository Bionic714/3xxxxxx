,Henriko78,2005-02-01T20:49Z,Jag tror inte dom har gjort en låt som heter Back To Mine. Jag har alla deras album och hittar inte nån som heter så.

,Boja,2005-02-06T05:20Z,"ok, here is the deal:
Please leave out any audio crap of your self presenting - its bullshit.
The tracks you have picked out - and the remixes, are over all, pretty cool. I presume that its not brand new, since there are no tracks, of the latest album. thats a shame , while its one of the best albums - but the mixes are all about  fairly good, except some minor things, keep it up - great work.  I "
,Henriko78,2005-02-07T05:39Z,"Hey Man! 

Thanks for your comments. Yes, I will remove the voice intro for my next mixes. I realized myslef it sounded silly. When you said the new album I assume you mean ""Everything Will Be Alright Tomorrow"". Even though it is a very good album, I didn´t find any of those songs would fit in to the mix. Thanks again for commenting...
