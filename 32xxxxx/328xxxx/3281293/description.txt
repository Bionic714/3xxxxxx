Upon request I upload this movie again.  
sorry again for the previous inconvenience.
Gspot tells me that the codec is DivX 5.0 at 812 kb/s bitrate , audio ac3 (0x2000) Dolby Laboratories, Inc , 192 kb/s (96/ch, stereo) CBR, 48000 Hz.
Gspot tells me also the following:
This is a valid AVI file.

 The filesize is 701 MB (or 718,254 KB or 735,492,096 bytes). 
 Of that, roughly 567 MB (81%) is video data; the remaining 134 MB (19%) is audio.

 The file's length is consistent with information embedded within the file, so it's fairly safe to assume that this file is complete - i.e. the file has not been truncated or otherwise damaged.
