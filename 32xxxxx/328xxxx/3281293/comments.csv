,Bluesoul,2005-01-25T10:46Z,DVDrip right Orione?  Great movie btw! :)
,orione,2005-01-25T12:28Z,"Thank you: hope you all enjoyed it.  It's a pity that this movie as for the subject and content ended M. Powell career: prude society, pff! 
no idea whether it is a dvd rip: it's not my rip, but it looks too good to be a vhs.  consider also the fact that it is a 1960 movie with the technicolor they had then.  
Yes, Colonel Blimp will be one of the next.  
Pippin, i replied to you by mail about welles."
