Excellent progressive album from Denmark 1971. Some very heavy
guitar-riffs mixed with more mellow parts with lots of piano, flute,
acoustic guitar and even banjo. They made four albums up until 1977,
and this is the one to start with. This is not a progressive line release.
This is either an official Polydor-release or a very well done Bootleg-CD.

Possibly this has been seeded before, but I'm new here so I don't know.
This is my first torrent, so I hope it works out fine...
