,Salacious,2005-01-31T16:35Z,"Thank you so much for this! I have just ordered it on Amazon (JE Gardiner version), but this looks like it will do just the trick. Many thanks!"
,orione,2005-02-02T19:12Z,"Let me know what you think.  I will soon upload other Minkowski works.  
if you are interested in other Gardiner's performances, i have uploaded recently Handel's Messiah by him.  "
,Tarae,2005-02-04T06:19Z,"Thanks for sharing this! Minkowski's work is great and the ensemble of singers he gathers together is just awesome. 
So there's more, you say ? :D"
,orione,2005-02-04T21:01Z,"Yes.  Watch out for Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno by Handel, cond. Minkowski.
