An endless dazzling virtuoso singing by some of the most fantastic baroque music of a great composer.
Marc Minkowski is maybe the highest handelian interpreter to date.
Kozena and Massis are breathtaking.
If you don't know this CD, well, I recommend it strongly.  
I would appreciate your comments.
