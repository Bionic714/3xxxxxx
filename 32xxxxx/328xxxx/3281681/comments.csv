Jag kör VLC förresten."
,Bentis,2005-01-31T09:48Z,is this TeleCine or a very bad lighted dvdrip?
,IceBone,2005-02-01T00:28Z,That's how the movie was shot. Nothing changed.
,Narog,2005-02-04T08:52Z,So what about the glitch between 09:30 och 09:44. Am I the only one getting it?
,IceBone,2005-02-04T22:29Z,As far as i know the rip is identical to the dvd i ripped it from. And it was a retail dvd.
,IceBone,2005-02-04T22:32Z,"And yes, i do have the fps drop. It's how it was encoded. I'm gonna ask Dopey if that's how the dvd plays back too."
