The Video looked kinda weird when I played it in WMP but in PowerDVD and WinTV2000 everything was fine. 

Edit: As I recorded this using WinTV-PVR 350 the video is interlaced. So for a good viewing result you'll need a program that can deinterlace it on playback.
Windows Media Player can not do this so the result is not so good but it works...
WinDVD or PowerDVD can deinterlace on playback, just so you know!
