,heggiiman,2005-01-23T18:09Z,that´s why i recommended using firefox :)
,miljpewe,2005-01-23T18:14Z,Well the reg. file didn't help! The original game is 50 mb so I don't understand what this reg. file could do?
,heggiiman,2005-01-23T18:25Z,well i guess it helps if you have the full version then.
,Deadhate,2005-01-24T23:21Z,"I have the full version (30MB , RIP)"
,allan84,2005-01-27T03:13Z,then would u mind seeding it?
