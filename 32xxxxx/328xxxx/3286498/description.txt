This somewhat obscure session was reissued on LP by Columbia in 1980. Valve trombonist Bob Brookmeyer and tenor-great Stan Getz (who had played together regularly a decade ago) had a reunion for this date, performing five standards and three Brookmeyer originals. The young rhythm section (pianist Herbie Hancock, vibraphonist Gary Burton, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Elvin Jones) uplifts what would have been a fairly conventional (although high-quality) bop date. ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide
