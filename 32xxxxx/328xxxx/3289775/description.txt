Sometime in the late sixties, young Horace Swaby borrowed a classmate's 
toy instrument called a melodica. Since he already played the piano, the 
keyboard of this hand-held wind instrument presented no major challenge 
to the man who would become Augustus Pablo. But just as the Bible says 
that the Creator blew life into man, so did Pablo's breath become music.

A comment on Rising Sun:
Some say the Rising Sun release is marked by a slightly 'smoother' and 
more polished sound than previous releases from Pablo, and that this makes the release slightly less worthwile. Though they may be correct that 
it is smoother, I would definitely call this release a good one, almost bordering on classic but maybe not quite making it...
