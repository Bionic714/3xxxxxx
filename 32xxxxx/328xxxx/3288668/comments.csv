,Inkonito_Star,2007-11-07T13:43Z,"Sorry my fault, the torrent doesnt work.
But it removes trialblock (if you ben yoused alkohol 120%trial versin bifore.)
Torrent scaned whith kaspersky and no trojans where found. 
So after installed this verison you can update whith the trialversion"
,mik3,2009-03-14T07:02Z,"Some strange shit happened during installation of this program:

During install windows asks me if I want to continue to install some drivers; windows warns me to do this because it can't find who was distributing the drivers. I ignore the warning and choose to install drivers, and after a few seconds a screen with white and blue shows. after a few more seconds windows restarts and then i can't login to windows.I make a system restore and then windows worked.

I do NOT recommend this download."
