,mzimu,2009-02-15T09:37Z,"Hollywood, Madison Avenue, and the mainstream media celebrate Che as a saint and a sex symbol - a selfless martyr with a love of humanity second only to Jesus Christ's.

But their ideas about Che - Fidel Castro's henchman whose face adorns hipsters' T-shirts, posters, and ad campaigns - are based on a murderous communist regime's outright lies.

As Humberto Fontova reveals in this myth-shattering book, Che was actually a bloodthirsty executioner, a military bumbler, a coward, and a hypocrite. This biographical account proves it's no exaggeration to state that Che - who was captured and killed nearly forty years ago - was the godfather of modern terrorism.

And yet Che's followers naively swallow Castro's historical revisionism. They are classic ""useful idiots."" the name Stalin gave to foolish Westerners who parroted his lies about communism's successes.

,mzimu,2009-07-26T22:34Z,"How can a cowardly beet-red communist psychopathic sadistic murderer shockingly ignorant of Economics 101, and a military illiterate to boot, succeed in coming across to the world as a courageous, compassionate, idealistic, freedom-fighting leader whose military genius caused the collapse of Batista's armed forces? Actually it's not that hard if you have the right media and the right audience. Che had both. Fontova's demolition doesn't leave one single slat of the Che edifice standing. The cherry atop the Che sundae was always that, on top of everything else, he was a medical doctor. He was not.
