,bulafak,2005-02-07T17:09Z,"FAG + 69gays + Assmus + Paradise Losers = Negative
Anyway it sounds really GAY"
,Daemonius,2005-02-07T18:45Z,"Negative is definatelly NOT gothic rock. 

Negative is a lame-ass copy of the Original, Legendary, Glam Rock Band ... HANOI ROCKS

Negative is a disgrace in Finnish ock music scene.

This is my opinnion, thank you."
,foffy,2005-02-07T19:19Z,"I'm not a genre nerd, so I'll assume you're right (despite numerous sites defining them as gothic rock) and remove the reference. Can't agree to them being a disgrace, though..."
,wasa,2005-02-09T11:44Z,Hanoi Looks but NOT the Sound
,your666,2005-07-31T03:28Z,"They sound nothing like Hanoi Rocks so why compare them...... they look fuckin ridiculous like all other glam rock bands but what does that matter? btw, calling Hanoi ""original"" has gotta be the dumbest shit I've ever heard."
,shelbyvicious,2008-08-14T07:01Z,"Hanoi Rocks was basically a copy band of every raging glam rock band in America, so I agree with the comment above- Calling Hanoi Rocks original isn't really accurate, lawls. 

Don't get me wrong, Hanoi Rocks is a decent band- but there is nothing about them that really butters my bagel if you get my meaning. Negative has an original sound I've never heard in any other band- Finnish, or not. 

I wouldn't call it Goth Rock, but it's certainly original and certainly tasty. 

BTW, thanks for uploading this. Buying from the states is such a bitch."
