,dinocasino2,2005-02-04T18:26Z,"Stuck at 83%. PLease open up a seed, thanks!!"
,ca6,2005-02-08T16:42Z,"....could you please keep seeding until it's done now? This has taken forever, are you on a modem or something?"
,thelemite,2005-02-10T10:39Z,Something this good is rare on PB so it is worth the wait.
,tomo,2005-02-13T10:31Z,Come on. Been downloading for two weeks now. Im at 96%. 
,dinocasino2,2005-02-13T11:13Z,"While I am thankful for this post, I must say that it has been - by far - the SLOWEST torrent I've ever seen! Been downloading for weeks…"
,Jaernregn,2005-02-18T18:00Z,"Remaining files at ""my place"" are:

""1984-1986"" on ""Get In The Van"" (0%)
""El Nino"" on ""Think Tank"" (0%)
""Weatherman"" on ""Think Tank"" (95,5%)
""World Peace"" on ""Think Tank"" (97,0%)
""Adventures of an asshole"" from ""Human Butt"" (99,8%)
""1981-1983"" on ""Get In The Van"" (99,9%)

...if this could be of any help..."
,dinocasino2,2005-02-18T23:24Z,"Jaernregn: I'm missing the exact same files, the exact same sizes as well. Pretty strange!!

Can someone please re-post these files and we'll all be happy. Dr Braun?"
,thelemite,2005-02-19T09:15Z,"Agree, seems that we all miss the same thing."
,ca6,2005-02-20T22:00Z,Det här är ju helt jävla otroligt. Är det någon här som är seedern eller?
,l0rgy,2005-02-21T18:06Z,"Get in the Van/1-01 1981-1983.m4a (99%)
Get in the Van/2-01 19841986.m4a (0%)
Human Butt/01-01 Adventures of an asshole,m4a (99%)

Think Tank/1-04 World Peace.m4a (94%)
Think Tank/1-05 El Nino.m4a (0%)
Think Tank/1-06 Weatherman.m4a (92%)

Kan det bero på att de är en massa udda ascii tecken i filnamnet? För både de filerna som inte laddas ner och det som ligger över och under dem är de som somsagt inte laddas ner."
,Beorn,2005-02-21T23:08Z,it's worth a shot.. could the seeder please rename his files and create/upload a new torrent
,magalomaina,2005-03-05T12:46Z,"Yes, some liiittle seeding would be nice. We're all stuck at 96%. Only 110megs to go..."
