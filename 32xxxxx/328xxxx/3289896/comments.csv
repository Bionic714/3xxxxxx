,Hugin78,2005-02-14T12:16Z,Third Watch är helt klart den bästa serien tycker jag. Någon som har fler avsnitt eller hela säsonger att lägga upp så blir jag mkt glad.
,drcox,2005-03-09T14:16Z,skriv in här som torrenten stannar
,jepsoh,2005-04-20T13:45Z,where are the seeders?
,trucky63,2007-07-02T15:50Z,Inget ljud på vissa avsnitt??
,drcox,2008-01-24T12:41Z,"every episode can be seen with VLC media player, if you have some probs with an eps, re download it..."

,lorelund,2008-03-10T03:27Z,Hej! är det någon som vet var man kan ladda ner undertexter till Third Watch?
,dsy79,2008-03-13T16:02Z,I downloaded this torrent and it works but episodes 9-22 are upside down. Does anyone have an idea of how I can fix this? I have tried downloading it again but it still comes out the same. Any Ideas would be great. Download is clear sound is good but episodes 9-22 are upside down.
,rarrazz,2009-09-30T04:07Z,Would love seeders for this :)
,rarrazz,2009-10-25T23:34Z,There's a lot of people stuck at 92.8% if anyone wants to seed this!!
,xBrilwenx,2010-01-05T12:19Z,"I love the fact that you have uploaded all of 1-5 of third watch but, instead of uploading episode by episode of season  couldn't you just put them all in one big torrent like this?"
,SlimDog5,2011-06-19T02:41Z,seed pls ! xD
