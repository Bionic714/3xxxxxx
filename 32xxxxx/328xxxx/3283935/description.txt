Jericho's only album under this name. They also released albums
as Churchill's and Jericho Jones.
This album is full of heavy guitar riffs and the lead singer is
evil...
The band was based in Israel but two of the members were actually
americans.

Tracks:
1 Ethiopia
2 Don't you let me down
3 Featherbed
4 Justin and Nova
5 Kill me with your love

I read somewhere that somebody called Ethiopia the best opening track ever...
