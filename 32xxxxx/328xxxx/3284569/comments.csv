I haven't seen the third one, looking forward to it.  Thanks"
,Beat,2005-02-04T10:40Z,"I've uploaded the data twice; strange then that no one has completed the download yet. Perhaps some of you aren't uploading as much as you are downloading? In any case, you've got all pieces you need.
I might be back in a few days if necessary..."
,matz,2005-02-04T23:54Z,can you seed the rest of the movie? its 47 leechers now and they are probably stuck at 98% as I have been for the last couple of hours.

,artaud2005,2005-03-09T18:35Z,"Hi,
Would it be terribly rude of me to request a reseed of this wonderful contribution. I mean, this does look very fascinating and I'd adore to see it. So, please. Keep up the good work."
