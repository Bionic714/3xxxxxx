All ripped and encoded by me in Xvid with MP3 sound.  For convinience, I've made them all 100 MB, but still retaining the full 640x480 resolution and keeping great quality.  Please also note, I don't watermark, so if these are posted elsewhere, please give me credit.  After this is securely seeded, I'll start the second season.
