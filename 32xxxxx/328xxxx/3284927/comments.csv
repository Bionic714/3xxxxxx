I hope you'll like it ;)"
,Raingod,2005-02-04T01:29Z,"For those of you who don't know:
Ogg Vorbis is a compression format similar to mp3. It sounds a whole lot better though! :)
If you're using Winamp 3 and above I think you should be able to play Ogg Vorbis files without any plugins (I hope I remember correctly...)."
,Raingod,2005-02-04T01:32Z,Oh I forgot... I'm sorry for the slow upload. I'll get my new (faster) internet provider any day now = faster uploads ;)

,notarealperson,2007-11-27T20:30Z,"Thanks for this - shame it's rar'd.  I'll have to wait for the whole lot to download before I can listen to any of it.  There's not much point compressing a compressed format, anyway."
