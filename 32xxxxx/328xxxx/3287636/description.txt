9/11: The Great Illusion by George Humphrey

This important film will help open your friends' and family's eyes to the great illusion that the mainstream media has created around the September 11th attacks. The narrative of facts reinforced by visual evidence, poignant images and original music will compel the viewer to leave the old explanation behind and move toward a greater awareness of the New World Order.

This is one of the best 9/11 films I've ever seen. It covers the broad spectrum of facts exposing the globalists' orchestration of 9/11. -- Alex Jones
