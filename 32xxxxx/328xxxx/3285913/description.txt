You've probably seen those radio-controlled cars you can bounce, flip, and spin 
     because the top and bottom are identical; when they land after a jump, they start trucking 
        just as soon as they get enough wheels touching the ground to create some traction. 
     Now imagine that you could not only race a vehicle like that, but that you could also use it 
    to ram anything that gets in your way - other cars, barricades, construction equipment, columns 
              supporting massive buildings, you name it - without taking damage. 
       Add a couple of mounts for weapons and special items like missiles, turbo speed, 
         temporary wormholes, and even a tool that cuts off every competitor's engine, 
   and you've got a pretty good idea of what awaits you in Rollcage, an extremely cool arcade 
                        racer that does just about everything right.
