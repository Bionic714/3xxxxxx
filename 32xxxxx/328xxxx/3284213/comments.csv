,dekalen,2005-02-02T20:20Z,why not exeem lite 0.20?
,DizzyPoet,2005-02-03T05:56Z,"the exeem .20 that i have seen has *cydoor* in it , if that's what you what knock yourself out ."
,DizzyPoet,2005-02-04T05:13Z,"lite / regular I don't really care that much if you want to split hairs ....It's a .20 as in like a very beta product with a small but growing user base . The whole point it is still in EARLY development . Use it if you like , or don't . I do think that program is STILL asking that you do NOT distrubute it because it's BETA program 


lol     lite as in no adds ?????     yeah , ok . Whatever ."
,Tammuz,2005-02-28T00:58Z,"1. It still has Cydoor and all the spywares in it, only you now are given a choice not to run the spyware on your system !!!

2. It is NOT open source , on the contrary, it is a black box, and as in the case of ANY internet accessing software. It DOES have the ABILITY to spy on you for any reason.

3. So , it is a matter of trust , and you can ask yourself, would you trust someone who thought for once that it was ok to unleash Cydoor spyware on you  ... cheap !

4. Especially when there are such great OPEN SOURCE software like Azureus  ... why would any sane person run into the hands of that he should think thrice before trusting  .

Alas ! ... I guess there are still those morons who will run Cydoor anyway  ... and those ignorant who do not know that life outside such materialist garbage can exist"
