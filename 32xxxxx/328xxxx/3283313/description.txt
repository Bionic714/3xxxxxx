Issued as a companion to the book This Is Orson Welles, these four tapes contains a selection of the conversations between Orson Welles and Peter Bogdanovich. The quality varies a bit, the last two tapes are generally from better sources. A must-have for any Welles-fan.
I include a small, but funny clip where Welles is recording a commercial and gets more and more annoyed with the producers, giving them all kinds of abuse.
