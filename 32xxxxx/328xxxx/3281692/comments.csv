,gzl5ry,2009-03-25T10:08Z,"FYI:
The cover art in the yo yo ma stuff is wrong.
I catalog all my music with musicbrainz and the times matched up perfectly with the following release:

http://www.amazon.com/Bach-Six-Unaccompanied-Cello-Suites/dp/B0000025QM

When I checked the entry for the purported release (a soundtrack), the times were way different.

Also,
Beautiful music, there is something extraordinarily soothing about the solo cello. Very peaceful. Thanks so much, I will continue to seed this one for several days. :)"
