,BT-loader,2005-02-02T15:32Z,"Någon annan som har problem med denna .torrent? :crazy:

Efter jag har laddat ner 4439.40 så börjar laddningen om igen på 4435.00.

Kan man ""slutföra"" laddningen manuellt utan att förlora någon viktig ""piece/bit"", och sen bränna ner filmen?"

,sani_thakur,2005-05-10T02:03Z,"Hi,
Is anyone else having problems playing this ISO file?
I am trying to play this file, and it works well until the ""4th chapter"", that is, when Milo says he will Quit, and the cab reverses, and that man inside says "".....just like Ur grandfather.."" and tried to snatch his resignation letter, the File gets stuck..!! Can everyone here play the complete file ""without"" any problems??? Please let me know soon."
,sani_thakur,2005-05-11T21:32Z,"Also, when I am trying to burn this ISO file using either Nero or Alcohol, the file size says ""343.27 MB"". But when I click on properties of the actual ISO file, it says 4.33GB. I am not sure what is wrong, or how I can fix it. I mean, the data is there, but maybe somewhere in the middle it is corrupt or something. Someone please help."
