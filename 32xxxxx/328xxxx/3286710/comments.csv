BUY THIS GOOD GAME INSTEAD!
IT'S REALLY WORTH IT!"
,S-Mies,2005-02-07T18:12Z,"I will, tomorrow :)

For tomorrow I'll get my new Radeon 9600 and enough money to buy this game.

I use torrents shareware-wise: if you like it, buy it! If you don't, delete it!
Besides, if you download a game and it sucks, you'll feel better knowing you didn't just spend 50 euros/dollars/whatnot on crap."
