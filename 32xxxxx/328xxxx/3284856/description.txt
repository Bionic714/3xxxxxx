Aboute The Movie:
Filmed between 1977 and 1979 by Jack Hazan and David Mingay (the filmmakers behind the renowned 1974 David Hockney documentary A Bigger Splash), RUDE BOY utilises documentary footage and re-enactments of scenes from the day-to-day lives of the key players (notably Clash members Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon and Topper Headon) to tell the story of the film's eponymous hero (Ray Gange), who quits his job in a Soho sex shop to become a roadie for The Clash. Set against the grim backdrop of a country ravaged by race riots, mass unemployment, heavy-handed police tactics and the rise of Right Wing political factions, this compelling pseudo-documentary traces the early years of The Clash, the rise of a politician (Margaret Thatcher), and the story of one disaffected British youth, superbly portrayed by Ray Gange (the real-life inspiration for and subject of The Clash song Rudie Can't Fail). Above all, though, RUDE BOY is a priceless document of the devastating live power of The Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band in the World evidenced by their incendiary performance filmed at the SWP/Anti-Nazi League Carnival in London's Victoria Park.
