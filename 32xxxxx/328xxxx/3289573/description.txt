Unlike the crap edition Robbie Robertson compiled in 1975, this bootleg release contains all the songs from the basement sessions in 1967. Great songs that cant be heard anywhere else include: Sign on the Cross, I'm Not There, I'm a Fool for You, One Man's Loss, All You Have To Do Is Dream - and, of course, See ya Later, Allen Ginsburg....All songs have been remixed, which means, among other things, I shall be Released sounds like it should.

Note: This is an mp4 encode of Tree With Roots. You may have to download a plugin to play this, but windows media player usually takes care of that automatically.
