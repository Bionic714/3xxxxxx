,hulky,2005-02-04T23:50Z,did u use quarter pixel ?
,BagronkeN,2005-02-05T04:28Z,"hulky: No, AutoGK does not support quarter pixel.
But quarter pixel isn't always a good thing (sometimes good, sometimes bad), and doesn't make that much of a difference, and will also make the .avi unusable in a standalone player."
,hulky,2005-02-06T23:26Z,"thats good , cause i have a stand alone player :)  THXS"
,Temptation,2005-02-07T07:23Z,"Thank you!  This is another movie on my list of movies I should have watched by now but haven't yet.  Your previous rips were excellent in quality, so I'm sure this one is too.  I got ""Ed Wood"" and ""The Thing"" from you and they were fantastic quality!  Keep up the good work!

,BagronkeN,2007-01-31T20:14Z,You should note that this torrent is almost TWO YEARS old and you cannot expect torrents that old to be well seeded. It's quite amazing that it still has a seed at all. Sadly I don't have it myself any longer or I'd help out.
,gaalen111,2007-06-19T01:38Z,"baaaah. this is sooo slow that I think I'll go buy the movie tomorrow.... -.-

,jollikolli,2008-01-26T20:08Z,"This is almost three year old torrent by now and it's still working. Do you guys really think that The PirateBay is just a place where you can just come to download stuff like this without even seeding them!? Torrents 'die' because there is no seeders anymore, so just keep seeding when the download is ready!"
