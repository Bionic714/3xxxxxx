SafeGuard Easy v3.20.1.93.SR1 *MULTiLANGUAGE* (c) Utimaco Safeware AG 
      
   SafeGuard  Easy provides  total company-wide  protection for  sensitive
   information on laptops and workstations. Boot protection, pre-boot user
   authentication  and  hard  disk  encryption  using  powerful algorithms
   guarantee  against unauthorized  access and  hacker attacks.  SafeGuard
   Easy  is  both simple  to  install and  operates  transparently in  the
   background.

   SafeGuard  Easy  not only  supplies  vital boot  protection  on Windows
   platforms,  but also  protects sensitive  data using  strong hard  disk
   encryption.
   
   Using SafeGuard Easy, unauthorized  access to sensitive information  on
   laptops or desktops is effectively prevented, because:
   
   Without  correct  authentication,  all  data  remains  encrypted  (boot
   protection).
   
   Unauthorized persons are prohibited  from accessing the system  because
   pre-boot authentication (PBA) requires  the authentication of the  user
   before the operating system is  started. PBA cannot be manipulated  and
   therefore guarantees maximum security.
   
   Many other protection programs are ineffective because they permit  the
   readout of  the keys  or passwords  from the  hard disk. SafeGuard Easy
   prevents this by generating the code key required for boot-up from  the
   typed  password.  Even  hard  disk  analysis  tools  become ineffective
   against SafeGuard Easy.
   
   Unlike other solutions which encode only selected files or directories,
   SafeGuard Easy encodes the entire content of the hard disk. This  means
   that all the information on the hard disk is protected - regardless  of
   where the data is stored.
   
   Utimaco Safeware  uses powerful  algorithms and  encryption methods  to
   ensure that  operating processes  are executed  efficiently and without
   delays.
   
   SafeGuard Easy  provides boot  virus protection  to resist  boot sector
   viruses - hazardous sabotage tools that operate by interfering with the
   Master Boot Record and allowing hackers to gain control over the PC.
   
   SafeGuard Easy lives up to its name within all organizations regardless
   of their size.  The software can  be installed conveniently  throughout
   the  company  using  configuration  files  without  user  intervention.
   SafeGuard Easy also allows user-specific privileges to be defined (e.g.
   disabling disk encryption).
   
   A  secure  challenge/response   procedure  is  available   to  re-issue
   passwords that have been entered incorrectly or forgotten.

   
   Characteristics
   The most significant features of SafeGuard Easy are:
    Boot protection - allows boot-up  of the operating system only  after
     correct authentication
    Strong hard disk encryption to protect information 
    Encryption of external data media (e.g. floppy disk, ZIP,JAZ etc.) 
   
   Easy handling, full scalability,  distribution via network and  central
   administration  confirm  SafeGuard  Easy as  the  security  solution of
   choice for every organization whatever the size.


   Pre-Boot Authentication
   The user  is authenticated  by means  of pre-boot  authentication (PBA)
   before the system is started and therefore before the operating  system
   is booted. Neither keys nor passwords are stored on the hard disk.

   
   Hard Disk Encryption
   SafeGuard  Easy  encrypts the  entire  hard disk  or  individual parts,
   irrespective  of the  file system  (e.g. NTFS,  FAT etc.)  - sector  by
   sector,  including  the  operating  system,  temporary  files  and  all
   information. SafeGuard Easy effectively  closes the security gaps  left
   open by arbitrary file encryption.  Data that has been encrypted  using
   SafeGuard Easy is securely protected from unauthorized access, even  if
   the hard disk is removed.
   
   
   Algorithms
   SafeGuard  Easy  supports  the  newly  designated  advanced  encryption
   standard, AES, with  256 and 128  bit key length,  Rijndael 256 bit  as
   well as  IDEA 128  bit. This  powerful and  globally accepted algorithm
   guarantees maximum protection.
   
   
   Encryption of External Data Media
   SafeGuard Easy supports the secure exchange of data between  individual
   company offices by  using configurable data  media encryption (such  as
   floppy disk, ZIP, JAZ etc.).
