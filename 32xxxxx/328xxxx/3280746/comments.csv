,KingStar,2005-01-23T19:38Z,"Thanks,
I figured they were hard to get that's why I wanted to share them.

Enjoy."

Thanks

,corporeal1,2005-04-23T02:08Z,"KingStar, thanks for the time machine.

I've been looking for these for ages.  Haven't heard them in probably twenty years since playing my brothers records when he wasn't looking.  Just one question, how do you play the the CD backwards?  Ha!

,darkshornn,2005-06-09T03:10Z,Can we get someone to seed this please?
,darkshornn,2005-06-09T03:14Z,"Oh, by the way the group has remastered some of their albums which are available to order over the internet at http://bullseyecanada.com/template.php?TypeID=Artist&PageID=artist_page&ArtistID=125 and the groups homepage is www.klaatu.org."
,KingStar,2005-08-15T11:07Z,I'm reseeding for a while now.
,KingStar,2006-01-03T11:22Z,I'm sharing these AGAIN! At least people can do is share it for a while when they get a full copy...
,coop79,2006-03-02T19:13Z,Can someone pls seed for a short while?
,qwerty,2007-02-20T03:41Z,Thank's a million!!!!!
,Linkani12,2007-03-17T23:37Z,"Downloading once more.
Will keep it alive until me or my HD wears out."
,CyruDraxs,2007-11-01T10:15Z,0 seeders makes me sad. :(
,CyruDraxs,2007-11-01T23:31Z,Yay! Downloaded and seeding until at least 100 share ratio!
,Sloppsbox,2008-01-17T03:20Z,"CouldnÂ´t be more happy!
Been searching for ages.
:-)
Thank you ever so much mate!
Now for some serious seeding.
Cheers!"
,skwiez,2008-05-26T03:43Z,"Thank you so much! I had all of these until my harddrive crashed, and they're not easy to find!"
,skwiez,2008-05-26T20:59Z,"This is good but not perfect. For some reason each disc is ripped at a different bitrate. 3:47 EST is at 320kbps, Hope and Sir Army Suit are at 192kbps, Endangered Species is mostly 160kbps except track 1 is VBR and track 6 is only 128kbps. Magentalane is the worst, and is a random mix of 128kbps, 160kbps, 192kbps, and VBR tracks. It seems like these might be sourced from different sources and possibly different versions of the album."
,newbrownshoe,2011-04-28T11:19Z,Thx KingStar. 6 years later the seed is still alive....
,deadres,2011-08-02T08:47Z,I am going to seed this for the longest time ever. Thanks so much!! I've been looking for this for months!
,pwad57,2012-09-02T18:55Z,"I wonder why Steve Smith wrote ""Could Klaatu Be the Beatles? Mystery Is a Magical Mystery Tour.""?

Klaatu's music was more like Pink Floyd!!

Thanks for UL :D"
