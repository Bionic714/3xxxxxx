,ggteaca,2008-03-03T10:18Z,I am new with computers. How do I view this TV show after downloading? I opened it with windows media player but it does not. :( please help....
,slippery1,2008-07-16T23:53Z,if you are not an artist or a medical student and you are watching this u are a sick fuck and i hope you die a horrible death 
,skamatic24,2008-10-06T08:59Z,Thank you!
,Necro-I_mean_MedStudent,2009-08-02T00:25Z,"I watch it for the articles. When you receive your copy, be prepared to correct the aspect ratio, as mine arrived out of proportion. This is exceedingly simple, just set the aspect ratio on your converter/burner to 4:3 and set the resize method to ""stretch"". I used ConvertXtoDVD 3 (my OS is Vista) and the web is crawling with similar converter programs if you don't have something already. I'm afraid I can't help with subtitles since I myself am still looking for a reliable subtitle program. Everyone on the show is speaking English, with lots of amusing accents. Aside from the aspect ratio, the quality is excellent. (Thank you!) Wearing a rubber while whacking off to this video greatly enhances that ghastly medical feeling, especially if you have steel furniture to sit on. I personally recommend watching it while lying in a sterilized bathtub full of ice water and piercing your nipples and genitals with hypodermic needles. Well, I hope I've been helpful. Auf Wiedersehen!"
,rsbatt,2010-05-18T13:25Z,"slippery1, why so rude? If others are interested in what makes their body work why does that offend you so much? Do you have a problem with people learning? Maybe you physically can't learn because you're so inbred and so you hate it in others?"
,AlexLibman,2012-08-19T11:39Z,"Slippery seems to call for what I call ""compartmentalization of knowledge"", a form of intellectual elitism.  Only medical students should have access to medical information.  Only the priests should read the scripture.  Etc.  This is typical in highly totalitarian regimes.  In the bad old USSR, some ""restricted"" textbooks (ex. on economics) had to be smuggled out of university libraries and hand-copied to be circulated by the underground resistance movement...

But here on The Pirate Bay we seem have the opposite philosophy - let knowledge be free."
