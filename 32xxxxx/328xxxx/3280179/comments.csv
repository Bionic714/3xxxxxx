,rocoyanna,2006-02-26T13:55Z,This torrent contains only turbotax state and does not contain turbotax premier. The name of the torrent should be changed to reflect that or the torrent modified and turbotax premier added. Thanks.
,rocoyanna,2006-02-26T23:26Z,Perhaps I just do not know how to use this file. i see a ttpsin.bin file in my download. Is that perhaps turbotax premier? How do i install it? thanks.
,huneyberd,2007-04-13T01:02Z,please seed.  i need help downloading
,stratman71,2007-04-15T05:38Z,"Thnx for the seeds, DL'n now"
,mshmsucks,2007-08-04T20:41Z,"Please seed, need to download."
,SneakySis,2007-10-07T04:08Z,"I have to agree totally with RocoYanna --

This torrent does not contain the proper file(s) for both the State and Federal tax programs for 2004 -- only the State forms are here, and they depend on the Federal portion of the program to install and operate properly.

File is old, so I doubt that it will ever get changed, but I'll post here on the off chance that it will save download time and space for others"
,halafax92342,2010-03-18T00:22Z,Does not work unless you already have TurboTax installed. Does anyone have federal TT 2004?
,abletonlive05,2010-04-20T14:47Z,"Grüße Fräulein, Sturm-Verbot-Führer, this and rabbit in the moon will not download, and I had tried to download rabbit in the moon during two years, it rests just there and indicates that there is a seed and all the others function just very well"
,max1341,2012-02-17T00:44Z,"Please seed. I have the federal TurboTax 2004 and I'm going to upload it soon. I've been monitoring this torrent for awhile but nobody is seeding. Please seed. Please, Please, Please......................"
,mylittlemeatball,2012-03-04T23:33Z,"Agreed, this does not contain Premiere, just state.  I have to file my 2001-2006 returns and really, really, really need this file!"
