,Sasson,2005-01-29T10:18Z,"Very good movie, but How do you burn this? All my burner apps fails due to the missin IFO file. "
,Misskelly,2005-01-29T11:25Z,"I burned it with NTI DVD-maker, just drag and drop the VOB-files. You can also use NERO. It is NOT the same techniq as when you burn an image. Good Luck!"
,Sasson,2005-01-29T16:54Z,"Succeeded to burn it with DVD-Maker, but it is not playable in the DVD player as the IFO file is missing. Any idea guys?"
,Misskelly,2005-01-29T17:03Z,"If your DVD has the right codec and can play DVD-r, it should be able to play om your DVD. Not all DVD-players can play all the formats."
,Sasson,2005-01-29T17:11Z,"No problem here actually. My burner however only support DVD+R and that might be the problem (I don't know, but does not DVD-R need the IFO file?)."
,macdumpy,2005-02-01T13:02Z,"I don't beleive this is a valid rip. The .IFO, and .BUP files are missing. As well, Ifoedit reports it cannot make .IFO/.BUP for the .VOBs as no IFO information exists withing the VOBs.  If anyone has a clue on how to make a DVD from thease freel free to speak up."
