,ffinfinity1,2011-03-20T06:51Z,"This is most definitely a game and it works on my computer, only it is probably the one of the worst games i ever played. Save system sucks, i mean their is no point to even having the Manual Save System system it only start from the beginning of a level which the games automatically saves too. Gun Fights are horrible and even hard. From what I've seen its incredibly linear and i don't see an overlaying Plot or story that can get me immersed at all. They basically tell you to get this or go here or so far all i hear is WE MUST KILL SO-POT. Only Perk is that its a torrent and didn't pay for this at all. Red Faction 1 was infinitely better in so many ways. Only reason i got it was to play RF1,2, and Guerrilla in order -,- I can see why it took so long for some to make a RF game after 2, they probably abandoned the series after that game."
,baab32,2011-06-03T00:57Z,"i to get the black screen at startup....bleh wanted to replay this game. well too bad.

oh and james_hetfield: If you have that much money why dont you buy the game?
these poor people keep needing to justify useless stuff..."
,tigersquall,2011-08-28T00:22Z,"looks fake. i was hoping for a real version, been looking for a while."
