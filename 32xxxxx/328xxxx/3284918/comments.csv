""open in program"" -> find WinRAR on your computer, extract the ISO, burn it with Nero etc.

,BaNdO2007,2007-09-14T13:19Z,"If you got files ending with .001, 002, 003, then just open the file(s) in winrar..
""open in program"" -> find WinRAR on your computer, extract the ISO, burn it with 
Nero etc..

If you got a file ending with a ""R00"" and the rest files are like .001, .002, .003,
then just use HJSplit and ""Join"" after done Joining, rename the file to ""RAR"" then extract to, it will create a ""ISO"" file, burn it with 
Nero etc.."
