*** SPOILER ***


Boyd offers to coordinate a church fund-raising dance marathon in the hopes of sweeping Sarah off her feet and putting some of his past demons to rest; Meg and Amber's friendship puts Ben on edge; Judy sees Christina in a new light; Paula continues to be the object of Christina's fury, as Christina's anger turns the dance into a literal bloodbath and brings it to a crashing halt.

# NOTE: Original Ratings: This episode revolves a little more around Boyd.
# This episode has similarities to the Stephen King horror story Carrie, about a girl with powers who wrecks a school dance, turning it into a "bloodbath".
# Christina is wearing a cross necklace. This could possibly be foreshadowing.
