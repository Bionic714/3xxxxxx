,blottieb,2005-01-24T05:32Z,"So I've downloaded and burnt the files included in the download, however the files are .mdf.  What exactly do you do after the files are burnt to disc, and how do you ""install"" the game from that point?

iso and mdf is basically the same, you might have to use different configurations though.."
,tiberiu,2005-01-27T07:22Z,use alcohol 120% to emulate or write the image
,thanez,2005-02-03T03:57Z,um how come this takes a gig space? i thought most hgames were on about 200-300 mb :]
,berothar,2005-02-08T10:53Z,"when I've ""installed"" the game from cd1 and cd2 do I have to copy the Minyamnl.exe from cd2 to the 'real' game folder?

I've tried this but it's still asking me to create a account and fill in a registration key. 

tips or hints would be nice"

,Bamse_jp,2005-02-28T13:38Z,any chance of getting more of these games from www.g-collections.com ?
,VenQWish,2005-08-17T00:24Z,it's dead? man I really want this one :)
,Callintz,2006-02-16T01:50Z,"I know this is a little old, but still, I really wanna try this one out. I dled the game from a diffrent torrent I found. But than I dled the crack from this game, I followed:

3. Extract the MINYANML.EXE and replace it with the one from the game directory.

But everytime I try to play it I get the error

""Cannot use connect file GGD""

Any ideas?"
,NekoOrben,2006-04-11T10:12Z,"this is what i don't get, so maybe someone can help me out. I used both alcohol 120% and Daemon Tools. They both let me mount the files as a CD. But when i go to install it, it wants the Install Disk. I can't change any of the names of the ""CD's"", what do i do to get this game running.

,Jerkonen,2006-04-11T16:06Z,have any1 got this game 2 work?
,hyperionxt,2006-04-15T15:18Z,i have
,Piratebay4life,2006-06-29T15:10Z,I sort of got the game to work all I need to do to make this game work is a product key and i'll be done
,Piratebay4life,2006-06-29T15:10Z,anyone have a Virtual Mate product key
,kalle7890,2006-07-26T00:56Z,does anybody have a registration key to virtual mate? i would really appreciate any help.
,firefox-5321,2006-08-20T08:17Z,"I am getting the same problem, im also getting the ""Cannot use connect file GGD"" problem. So if anyone could give us a product code for it, or a better explained solution it would be greatly appreaciated."
,BaiRO,2006-09-28T07:19Z,"""Let`s Meow Meow vmate crack made by Pahn.rar"" there's a file in the download map by that name, go figure what it's there for.."
,Truhls,2006-11-14T21:00Z,It would be alot easier to replace the crack with the MINYANML.exe in the dir if there WAS ONE. There is no MINYANML in the game DIR after installing. So there is NOTHING to replace it with.
,Truhls,2006-11-14T21:17Z,"ok i figured it out, this game makes TWO different game DIRS. One for the VM launch program, and one for the game itself. The game itself makes a dir called YAMIKUMO, that is where the MINYANML.exe is. Just replace the crack with that file and it works fine."
,omegashrn,2007-01-08T20:30Z,"When i'm installing the game it says insert game disc, i mount disk 2 with daemon and click okay, but it doesn't work. Why? could someone help me figure this out. "
,kawaiievil,2007-01-22T20:08Z,"Ok....i Successfully got this working and i will try to help some of you guys. After mounting or burning the files you then install the game. For those who's installer Says to insert disc 2, Note that it wont be able to find disc 2 UNLESS it is mounted on the same drive as disc 1 (i hope that helps a few of you). Also, The MINYANML file with the icon of a Cat Girl that comes in the zip file does actually have to replace something. Copy the MINYANML file you extracted, Then...in your program files there should be a new folder named YAMIKUMO, in that folder there should be another folder called MINYANML, and inside THAT folder there will be the Cat girl icon you copied earlier- Replace that file with the one here by pasting in the folder. You now have the cracked version and it wont ask for a code~ have fun playing ^^"
,kawaiievil,2007-01-22T20:14Z,"""Replace that file with the one here by pasting in the folder.""

Sorry, i explained that bit a bit funny. What i meant was- Paste the MINYANML file you copied (The cat girl icon from the zip file) Where the other MINYANML file is to take over it and give you the cracked version.

(Remember that the MINYANML file your getting rid of is in Programs, YAMIKUMO folder and then MINYANML folder) I hope this helps all of you that are having trouble"

,TarballX,2007-11-01T23:17Z,"I don't see how so many people are having problems with this. I used Daemon tools, but alcohol 120 will work fine too. Just mount Let's_Meow_Meow_CD1.mds and start the installer. Half way through it'll ask you to put the second cd in, just unmount the first mds and mount ""Let's_Meow_Meow_CD2.mds"". When its done, extract the exe from the crack.rar into the folder you installed the game to, and overwrite the old exe.
You don't have to install the virtual-mate launcher when it asks you if you want to, since the patched exe bypasses that."

[T],Hgames,2009-03-02T07:00Z,"@Lordlouis what are you playing this game on? If you are talking about a joystick or game controller that you use on your pc messing with the scrolling of the text I would suggest going in to Control Panel>Device Manager and disabling you game controllers and just re enable them after you play. You may even have hands free mode on lol and your text speed set to fast which would be pretty hard to keep up.

@jkissm With most bishoujo titles you can leave the game by either right clicking on the screen ""not the text box because that usually hides the text box for you"" or by hovering your mouse pointer at the top of the screen and as always if your not tech savy you would not know about holding ALT and hitting F4 at the same time which will close any window that is currently active. Try it now with your browser up, Hold Down ALT and HIT F4. :P Jeez guys I always wonder how people stumble upon these sites with no knowledge about the thing that they just turned on. "

,Gashimahiron,2011-03-19T18:50Z,"yeah!
i have no problem with hentai at all!
with hentai's, there are no risks of you finding your friend's mom(or sister, or girlfriend) fucking with 3 or 4 giant-sausaged black guys!

PS:this REALLY CAN HAPPEN!
so if you watch normal pornography better change fast or you might lose a friend or have him hunting you for seeing his (mom,sis,girlfriend) naked for the rest of your life!

oh and you need daemon tools lite, you can mount both images but if it doesn't work mount the 2nd image on the same Vdrive of the 1st install disc, or the installer won't find the 2nd disc
hope this helps anyone in doubt"
