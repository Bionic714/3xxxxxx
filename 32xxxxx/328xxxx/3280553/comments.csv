,Dr. J,2007-02-28T01:34Z,"I downloaded the game, but I have no clue how to get it working, I installed it, but that is as far as I got. Can anyone help me?

Sorry, I'm kind of a noob at downloading torrents and setting them up. :\"
,p4r4m,2007-11-06T05:14Z,"ok i installed it and run the crack, it starts but crashes straight away. any ideas? i'm thinking maybe not compatible w/ vista."
,Relow,2007-11-21T05:40Z,"HOW TO GET THIS WORK

,BlackMaryFlint,2009-07-02T10:57Z,i've installed it but it still asks me for a cd. what now? and as for the crack. it just made my screen flash black twice and nothing happened...
,Piemongler,2009-09-07T03:39Z,"For vista users, you need to run this in windows 98 compatibility mode to make it work."
,cornbread3,2011-01-16T06:18Z,Great game. It took some time to figure out how to set it up but it was well worth it.
,eman188,2011-07-10T14:49Z,So I run setup.exe and it tells me that the system can't find the specified file. I've also tried todus.exe and autorun.exe to no avail. any suggestions?

Win32:Malware-gen

Could be a false positive but if you're going to download it, be sure to run in sandbox mode."
