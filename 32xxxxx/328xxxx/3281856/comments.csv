,comendante,2005-07-24T12:40Z,This files wont work! You cant play them! Dont download this!
,saknad,2005-08-02T22:38Z,"comandante: Don't worry, all you need is a decent audio player capable of playing Ogg Vorbis files. One example is the latest FULL version of WinAmp."
,klunden,2006-06-22T12:21Z,Thanks! Wish everyone used OGG (or at least FLAC) for music!
