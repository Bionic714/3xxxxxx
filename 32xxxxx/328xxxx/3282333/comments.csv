,maxgrande,2009-01-05T11:27Z,"Gosh, THANKS for this one!  It's just an excellent movie in every way (except for explosions ... sorry, folks, no explosions at all).  Saw it with my sweetie five years ago and never thought to see it again.  She'll be happy, and that's a good thing.  But so will I, and that's a good thing too.

You have my gratitude, Munda, for your generosity AND for your good taste.

Regards, M."

I ""added to archive"" and it created one 700MB rar file, but when I try to convert that file, it just recreates the original folder full of small rar files that I started with. I'd appreciate any help/advice."
,SloMoe,2009-01-13T22:21Z,"Thanks looking good. @DanielPlainview, if you haven't already got help. You open one of the files for instance *.001 and then ""extract"" not ""add to archive"". That will do it I think."

,ManLemon,2011-06-12T04:55Z,"Thanks for the upload, though these days it's kind of pointless to still use .rar ... it demotivates people to seed longer."
,Grievon_Mortum,2011-06-26T12:36Z,Good quality but the movie itself is smaller than all the RARs together and I didn't download samples and subs... So what's the point. But thanks anyway
,coreblimmey,2011-07-24T17:29Z,Thank you very much for uploading. It's smaller movies like this that makes Torrent sites so wonderful. But the mass downloads of the blockbusters will ruin it for all of us  :(
,andrei3600,2012-02-11T12:34Z,thanks dude!
