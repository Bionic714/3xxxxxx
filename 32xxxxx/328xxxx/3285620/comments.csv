The party involved wasn't married as mentioned earlier.  Also the filming was done illegally without their consent.  In fact the woman who commissioned the spycam to be put in was sent to jail for it.

BTW, the lady isn't an elected politician either, but certainly very active in the Taiwanese political circle at the time, kinda like a lobbyist."
