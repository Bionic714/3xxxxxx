 I download the 100% of the torrent then i analize the files with Shrink and the preview is ok, but when is burning showme something like arragement of the files and when i saw the dvd failed! i tried four times but always fail.
 Can you help me? because i´m a fan of this movie and i want to have it but i can´t burn the4 dvd"
,whindbagg,2008-12-09T01:58Z,"Thanks Oldschool! I first saw this in the late eighties and it always stuck in my mind as a perfect example of light, escapist entertainment, and missed not having it around. And that you uploaded as a full-blown, un-compressed DVD file is so, so sweet. If I have one ding, it's the fact that it's the full screen version rather than wide screen, but what the hey. I will seed as long as my electric bill allows. Again, many thanks!"
,konrak,2011-03-24T12:24Z,I am looking for this great moovie with polish lector or/and subtitles.
