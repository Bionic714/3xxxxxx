,deldiablo,2006-03-03T09:21Z,is this the 1962 or 1997 movie ?
,woytas34,2006-09-20T09:55Z,"Please seed, tragic speed around 2kb/s :/"
,evr,2007-03-15T04:09Z,"After reading the description I didn't think it was actually Lolita, but since ninjaboll mentioned the actor playing Lolita I guess it is. Wouldn't really call it a 'soft erotic movie' but I guess that's just me.

Oh, and it's the 1997 version by Adrian Lyne."
