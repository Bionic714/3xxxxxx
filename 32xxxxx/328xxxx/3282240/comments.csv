And when I post, I post in english, considering it is a universal language, although I do speak french and I do understand some spanish and italian.

So I found a website that does the WORSE swedish translation and for the first post, it wasnt too bad, basically said that the idiot who posted this torrent had the wrong category and it was in spanish. But the second one, I had more of a hard time.. told me something totally off topic.. That's OK, I'll figure it out.

POINT IS: This is a swedish website, post either in swedish or english not spanish you dumbass, this aint no torrentazos shit.. :P haha"

,jcunn78,2006-06-16T04:55Z,"I'm sure that hyde678 was trying to suggest that the whole purpose of this site is to share what you have. If you post things in English, there will be more people willing to download the things that you want to share. 
I'm sorry that you think that Americans are of the opinion that the world belongs to them...we can't help the facts."
