Here's the last season to air on TV.  Unfortunately, these aren't on DVD yet, but these are all TV rips done by either Xavier or Geophage.  These are all 120 MB encoded in Xvid with 128 kbps MP3.  Since the sizes varied, I reencoded to bring these all down to around 120 MB, but I take no credit for the original encoding.  But anyways, here's season 3 to tie us all over until season 4...enjoy!
