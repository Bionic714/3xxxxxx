,jerry_only,2005-02-14T19:43Z,could you upload the entire movie 
,fresh_kills,2005-02-14T21:29Z,"Actually, that historical bit is complete bullshit.

""This story is just a myth as the real origin of bukkake is from the Japanese pornography scene. The main reason that the Japanese pornography scene came up with bukkake, is that it is illegal to show genitalia in films or videos in Japan. Therefore the Japanese came up with all sorts of strong sexual fetishes that allow a release to not being able to view genitalia, one of which is bukkake.

Bukkake itself is actually not even a sexual word. It is a combination of two other words: butsu and kakeru. Butsu menas to strike or to hit, while kakeru means to pour or shower.""

Be realistic, please."

I took only the first part from the explanation at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukkake
and the humiliating part is the part what goes best with this movie.  Being Showered with sperm.
Cheers ;-)"
,fallinprince,2005-02-23T05:13Z,"obviously the ""guru"" up there knows little about japanese culture as a whole frankly genitalia was never forbidden to be shown as is directly reflected in there practice of public baths and not to mention there animation its quite the opposite the only reason japan has a legal age for consent is due to united states pressures on it "
,Kiba,2005-02-24T00:37Z,"Bukkake comes from the nordic words: ""Buk"" and ""kake"", or in english ""stomack"" and ""cake"". 


...OK, i just mad that up! Who cares?! Its all about that ONE slut who gets a shower of cum all over herself; that's the thing that arouses us! Fuck history...."
