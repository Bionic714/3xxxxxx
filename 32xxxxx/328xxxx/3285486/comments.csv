,cerebo,2006-01-23T17:56Z,"for those that need to get around the dongle prob, either pop your burnt disc in or mount the image with daemon tools etc then goto the pantheon directory on the disc and copy the crack in there over to where you have installed avid on your hard disc."
,kraken7,2006-01-25T03:04Z,"cerebo; tried putting that file in several of the avid folders, but no luck. im guessing it has to be dropped in a specific folder?  also, is the file that needs to be moved the only file in that pantheon folder?  im ignorant, thanks man"
,lazydogii,2006-04-24T20:58Z,"uys, the process goes like this,

1.when we download the software, what we get is software in rar parts and one nfo file.
2.  now collect all the rar files into one folder.
3. open the first rar file and u will see one bin file and one cue file."

,Rikkko,2006-08-09T01:48Z,"Hi! Anyone got Avid Liquid 7 incl Keygen? If so, please make torrent and post. Thanx!"
,Skkky,2006-09-23T02:30Z,"Just incase some people are still confused on what to do with this torrent:

I unzipped everything and ended up with three files.

I used Nero to burn an image to a CD. I located the .cue file to do that.

Installed Avid. Had the dongle issue at first. To solve it, I opened up the CD[My computer>right click cdrom>open] I just burnt and went into the PANTHEON folder. Clicked the file that was in it. And for good measure, I also put it in with Avid in Program Files. Then everything worked great."

This is not just for film. You can get a free version of Avid Free DV that is just for DV if you like. But this prog is able to handle it also. Are you an Avid employee? ;)"
,whodunit,2006-11-23T03:51Z,after installing this I am having a cyclic crash! Avid wants to start after windows loads and then crashes puter. Anybody else experinece this?
,whodunit,2006-12-06T09:26Z,don't know why but I the crashing I had was related to my installation. This download is FINE.
,georgs_town,2007-01-19T17:42Z,"i solved the dongle problem:

- install avid xpress (in the country that is marked)
- restart the pc
- replace the file in the avid-folder with the one from the panteon-folder,
- create a shortcut from the panteon-folder and start avid pressing this short cut

but when i start, there comes a window twice, that there is an acces violation! then it crashes! what to do?

greetings"
,mcem222,2007-01-20T22:11Z,"ok I installed and had the dongle problem along w/ some other problems
First when I tried to load the application it said that some .dll's were missing, so I had to go to C:\Program Files\Common Files\Avid and copy the .dll files to C:\Program Files\Avid\Avid Xpress Pro (your directory may differ)
Then I had the dongle problem and I put the crack file in C:\Program Files\Avid\Avid Xpress Pro replacing the file with its same name"
