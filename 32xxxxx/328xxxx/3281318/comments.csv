,Mankind,2005-01-25T03:15Z,the better part is that the nfo's shows like they are supposed to.
,Kjellan66,2005-01-25T12:15Z,"Furthermore, all imdb or similar links are actuall links in the nfo with a nfo viewer, they are formatted the way they were intended, with the right font, and they print the way they should, and so on, but better than the outdated nfo viewer is GetDiz, http://www.outertech.com"
