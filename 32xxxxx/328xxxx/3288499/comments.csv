good choice again!!
One of my ""mythic"" movie!!
James Woods is just incredible & just love almost all Cronenberg's movies!!
Just one thing:
French subtitles availables??
Peace & big thanks!"
,vonkruel,2005-02-11T10:50Z,"Hi.

Unfortunately the sub-titles are limited... only english sub-titles available which doesn't make much sense.  I can assure you that it is untouched...  I guess Criterion doesn't put much premium on having sub-titles...

Personally I think they should put all kinds of subtitles on these discs, since they hardly take any space."
,TheAbsorbant,2005-02-11T11:05Z,"What DVD release is this? The only DVD I've ever seen of this movie (and the one I own) is single-disc, single-layer, 2.0 audio with only a trailer as extra...!"
,vonkruel,2005-02-11T11:19Z,"This is the 1st disc of the Criterion release.  There is one small extra on the disc, and 3 audio tracks:

1) dolby digital 2.0 mono (english)
2) commentary track with Cronenburg
3) commentary track with James Woods / Debbie Harry

Mono is a bummer I know .. but that's how the movie was apparently made (in 1983), and enjoyment of the film doesn't depend on audio that much IMO.

Hope this helps."

Sounds interesting. :)"
,vonkruel,2005-02-11T12:09Z,"I won't let you down -- will keep seeding for sure, but like I said I may disappear for a couple hours a day to play online games :)  Probably not for the next couple days though because I have lots of work to do.

This is probably my favourite Cronenberg movie.

Enjoy!"
