This is first disc of the Criterion release, which includes the film only.  I have not re-encoded it -- it is totally untouched.  The up side is that you get to choose whether or not to re-encode, and if so, what software to use.  The down side is that you can't just go ahead and burn to single layer DVD.  I chose this because I only have dvd2one, and I think most people prefer to have stuff encoded with CCE.  Besides, this is a _small_ DVD-9 :)

This is my first time posting anything -- please do not flame, instead just enjoy this great movie :)
