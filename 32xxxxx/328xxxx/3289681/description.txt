OK here's Dag Nasty live in 1987 and Propaghandi live outside in 1994. The Dag Nasty show is a great live performance with the bass player really having a good time, the singer this time is Peter Cortner. The Propaghandi show is on an empty block at a street corner and is one of the earlier shows that i have come across. These are both rare and the quality is good, enjoy!

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
