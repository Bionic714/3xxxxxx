,writingstatic,2005-08-13T08:26Z,"Demo works fine, but sadly not the patch (which makes the game all rather pointless). The patch (apparently) only works if you select 'Buy Game' within the game itself, which is meant to close the game and open up the 'JFK Reloaded' website. But since the website doesn't exist anymore, it doesn't open up, which I guess doesn't ""activate"" whatever secret file string needs activating for the patch to work. In short - not worth the download unless you want to watch the motorcade driving about, and not be able to do anything about it."
