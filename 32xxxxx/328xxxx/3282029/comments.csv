,philipmoller,2006-04-24T21:08Z,some one have subtitles for this? english
,sirjason,2007-10-08T15:57Z,"This is a RIP. You don't rip a DVD without subtitles and add them later. Once you rip it, thats the way it is and will be forever, sure it would be possible to add subtitles later. Anythings possible. Chris Rock says ""You can drive a car with your feet, but that don't make it a good IDEA!"" If you knew anything about PCs and Divx, you would know that. I'm not being an ass, but try doing this stuff sometime and stop asking others to do it for you. Stop ordering what you want and get off your ass and do it yourself. Rent the DVD and rip it with the subtitle you want. By The Way, if you can't understand what the Kings are saying then how could you relate to them. Waste of time for you to watch it in the first place. Stick to Andy Griffith and leave the more complicated tasks for the BIG BOYZ. I don't think I'm any more of a man than any of you guys who asked for the subtitles, but if I don't give you some kind of understanding, then you will ask the same question again. To me it was a stupid question. Not a stupid question at all, but since I understand the way things work it would appear stupid to me. Heres how it works. You put a DVD in your drive and rip it. When you load the file(Movie) to rip you have options just like if you were going to watch the film. If you select a spanish subtitle while you are watching a DVD and record it with a VCR then the VCR records just what you see on your tv screen. and the sound that you hear just as you see and hear. A rip works the same way. Once you rip the movie with or without the subtitle on, thats the way it will always be. The only logical way to change that is to start over and rip it again."
,Mortosda,2008-01-07T13:08Z,"Uploader, thanks alot bro. And, duuuuude sirjason you're so fucking way off. Why in the FUCK would you rip the subtitles off a fucking dvd when you can just google it and find it there? Retarded cocksucker. And btw, no it's not a big hassle to put in some subtitles with the fucking torrent. Big ups major75, thanks homie."
,clokverkorange,2008-04-13T09:17Z,"sirjason you are incorrect. You can find .srt subs online and either embed them or watch them with a player like VLC Media Player, without having to hard code them onto your video."
