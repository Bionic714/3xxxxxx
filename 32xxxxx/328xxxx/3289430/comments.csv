,cmg,2005-08-06T10:37Z,"Can any one seed?
I got 99.9%"
,coriander,2009-03-28T07:02Z,ditto on the seeding.  I will seed if I can just get that last 0.1%
,coriander,2009-03-30T00:20Z,gave up on this.  This scene is included in http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3677946/Ben_Dover_-__Fancy_An_Indian_(5_scenes) which has plenty of seeding.
