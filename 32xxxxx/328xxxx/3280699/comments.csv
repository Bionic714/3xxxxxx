,sum41kid,2007-04-23T08:17Z,Great Torrent Works Perfectly!
,sum41kid,2007-04-24T21:11Z,"Why do I have to enter the setup everytime I start the game. This leads to that my saved games dissapears.

Varför måste Jag gå in på setupen varenda gång jag går in på spelet. Detta leder till att mina sparade spel försvinner."

,Rambie2006,2007-06-28T13:14Z,How do i start this up
,teimu,2007-07-01T21:44Z,"man. fuck trying to get this dos game working. just download the HI-RES version from http://hrp.duke4.net/
Before, I couldnt get the config for the life of me (tried all settings, downloaded DOS sound emulators, etc), but the hires version is already compatible with XP. All I had to do was download it, install, and play. YOU DO NEED THE DUKE3D.GPF (or whatever), so this torrent is still useful."
,Franpa,2008-02-27T06:43Z,"This is the full version 1.3D which Duke it Out in D.C. asks for during it's install.

no seeding from the only seeder tho so i can't confirm what i said above :S"
