Henry Rollins - Shock & Awe: The Tour (2005)

Henry Rollins has more than ever to rant about in this performance from his recent Shock & Awe Tour, its title irreverently inspired by George Bush's early predictions of the Iraqi War's impact. With all the ferocious energy of his days as a front man for the punk group Black Flag, Rollins scathingly draws observations from his recent USO tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. He also tears across the American political and cultural landscape and ventures into more personal territory, talking about his eclectic career from music to books to TV and film, sharing his fascinating insights from traveling the world and revealing his hilariously unsuccessful search for love.

Henry Rollins is known as a spoken word artist, actor, musician and writer. His career achievements include mumerous albums (under both the Black Flag and Rollins Band banners), spoken word discs, books, and a host of film and television apperances. His spoken word tours have taken him around the world and have garnered him a large and loyal fan base.
