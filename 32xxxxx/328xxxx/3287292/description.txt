OK Here is the infamous 40 Minutes documentary on the band Combat 84. This proves that if there is a camera idiots will start a fight, for no other reason than to prove how dumb they are, enjoy!

Combat 84-40 Minutes Documentary UKTV 1982 SVCD 40 minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.   http://www.videolan.org/
