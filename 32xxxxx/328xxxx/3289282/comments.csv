,MrJAM,2005-02-13T11:05Z,"Torrent comment holds the following (answering the previous question):

""No silly dubbing, no hangups or crashes, no need for any stupid splitters. Just a plain good old eng xvid release. I d/l it from eMule @ like 0.8 kb/s, so plz treat it with respect :-)"""
,Ankokuu,2005-02-13T11:37Z,"what a pleasant surprise never knew there was a sequel out, thanks man! :thumbsup:"
,fr33r,2005-02-13T12:24Z,"@Ankokuu
Actually its a ""thirdquel"" (if there is such a word). If you want the sequel too then search for Cube 2 Hypercube."
,Ankokuu,2005-02-13T16:33Z,"its prequel believe me, just compare the retard from Cube 1 and this movie ;)

but you wont get to know that until the end of the movie"
,trashstar,2005-02-13T17:57Z,"@technoid: what's so shitty about the ORIGINAL .mkv-release (it was out a month before any of the scene-releases)?

that it has dual languages in a superior container? if you can't cope w that, you should be called lo-technoid..."
