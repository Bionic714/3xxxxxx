PLOT:
A  dedicated young medical student is assigned to probe into the mind 
    of Don Wake, a patient at a psychiatric hospital loaded with secrets. 
    She  pushes  him  to  reveal the truth about the brutal murder of his 
    mother,  but  Don  instead warns her of danger looming in the outside 
    world,  including a mysterious and threatening man named Malachi. Don 
    pleads  with  her  to break him out of the hospital in order to bring 
    the  truth  to  the  surface. But the student dismisses his claims as 
    paranoia... until someone begins to follow her every step. Soon Don's 
    delusions become her reality, and she must determine what is real and 
    what  is  merely  the  rambling of a madman. Teetering on the edge of 
    sanity,  she is faced with one last decision - whether or not to take 
    an extraordinary risk that could bring about a spectacular healing in 
    Don's mind... and her own.
