I'm new to Pirate Bay but I can confidently say that people like pctorrent make it the best place to get stuff. A friend of mine introduced me to it but I'm ashamed to say he's a leecher! I believe in ""share and share alike"". If there's anything you guys need seeded that I have, just give me a shout. 

Thanks again seeders!"
