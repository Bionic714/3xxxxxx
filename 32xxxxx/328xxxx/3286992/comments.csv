Can I hope for the remixed Street Legal too? The original CBS CD-release really had crappy sound ..."
,Pippin,2005-02-08T12:50Z,"Street Legal's coming up. The reissues I dont have is John Wesley Harding (but the remix is supposed to suck), Desire, Slow Train Coming, Infidels and Love & Theft. I hope to get them at the library, in time..."
,Pippin,2005-02-08T13:13Z,"Oh, and i dont have the remix of Another Side of BD.

About the CBS release of Street Legal: wasnt the original record not even mixed when it was release? I seem to remember something like that...."
