It is hard to recall now how deeply unfashionable country music was in 1969-- Dylan's label, Columbia, dismayed at his apparent retrogression, begged him to remove the word NASHVILLE from the album's title. However, as usual, he proved ahead of the game; his embrace of country ushered in Gram Parsons, the Flying Burrito Brothers, and scores of subsequent artists under the Americana banner. Prescient too was his nod to Johnny Cash, with whom he duets on the gorgeous "Girl From The North Country." Buoyed by an altered, near-crooning vocal style, most of the tracks are pleasant and enduring; the chart hit "Lay Lady Lay" remains one of Dylan's most engaging songs. <p> Note: This is an mp4 encode of the new "reissue" version of Nashville Skyline: Sound is superior, both when it comes the remix itself and the new mp4 standard. You may have to download a plugin to play this, but windows media player usually takes care of that automatically. </p>
