
This is the best audio ripper program that I know on the market. It takes ca 4 minutes to rip a whole cd-album. You can choose between lots of different audio formats and bitrates. I use to rip cds with 192kbit VBR mp3. The best feature however is the music database which instantly and automatically gives all mp3 or other audio formats the correct name.

Use the patch to activate this function. No need for extra serials.  

PS. One annoying thing is that Real Player like many other progs connects to internet without your permision. Use firewall to prevent this.
