   Description:


   Construct the Mansion - The Playboy lifestyle begins at home. 
   Will your home be a stately manor built for entertaining or a
   gadget lover's paradise? As your fame and wealth increase 
   you'll be able to add tennis courts, game houses, aviaries, 
   even the world-famous Grotto to your estate. Just make sure
   to build enough bedrooms for your girlfriends.

   Live the Playboy Lifestyle - What use is a stylish pad if you 
   can't share it with hundreds of celebrity friends? Spend the 
   afternoon poolside with a bevy of beautiful women, and then 
   change into your finest pajamas for an evening of decadent 
   dancing with chart toppers, industry moguls and all-star 
   athletes. Will you watch a movie in the Theatre Room or the 
   Playmates on the trampoline? Life can be so cruel.

   Build Your Empire - Fame and fortune don't come easy. Manage 
   a crack editorial staff, hustle celebrity interviews and mold 
   the magazine in response to a fickle market. Are readers 
   suddenly interested in sports? Maybe it's time to host a tennis
   tournament and schmooze Boris McEngroe. And remember, people 
   don't just read Playboy for the articles. Each month you'll 
   invite women to stay at the Mansion, manage their Playmate 
   training and oversee their sexy photo-shoots.

     guests, etc) and then work over a series of months or 
     years to achieve them.

     and the Playboy Mansion's rise to international fame.

     and individual freedom.
