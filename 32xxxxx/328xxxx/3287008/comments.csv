,Schumann,2005-02-28T12:32Z,När kommer season 3 och specialerna?
,CaptainBeefheart314,2008-02-25T19:08Z,"Hi, thanks for this. Great show, you've got taste man. One tiny comment though: could you please add your description in English? It is a lot more comprehensible for someone who isn't from where you're from...
And please add info on LANGUAGE/SUBs as well, so prospective downloaders  know what to expect ;-)
Ciao,
BG"

I bid you good day."
