I'm still having problems using BitTornado - I'm getting the same error-message. So i switched to BitSpirit, and it works fine.

About a week ago (or so) BitTornado didn't work at all on TPB, and BitSpirit was recommended by some other users. Although a bit getting used to when you're used to tornado, it's a nice prog which - so far - have worked everywhere.
