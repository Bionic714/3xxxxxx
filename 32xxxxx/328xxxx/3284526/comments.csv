,syllogist,2005-02-06T23:31Z,"Hey DogShitTaco, if it's not too much to ask, for the next disc, could you exclude some of the extra-english audio tracks in order to encode the video at a higher bitrate with more passes, it's just somewhat grainy as is. Thanks nonetheless though this upload is immensely appreciated."
,dogshu,2005-02-07T04:35Z,"Hey DogshitTaco, I get the ""got bad file info - path disallowed for security reasons"" error on this torrent and the other 2 TNG SE4 torrents.  I'm using the original bit torrent client from http://bittorrent.com/

What clients are you guys using to download this?"
,DogshitTaco,2005-02-07T10:02Z,"About video bitrate:
I can exclude the extra-english audio tracks, but it wouldn't make much difference. It is shot for telivision and doesn't have a great resolution to start with.
I have watched the originals on both 32"" widescreen(grainy picture) and 54""(horrible).
However, i will do as you ask on the next release. Please tell me if you think there are any significant improvement!

About download errors:
I'm sorry, but i haven't got a clue why some ppl get this error. I have heard that if you try with a different client(rehash the torrent, do not start from the beginning!), it can help.
I have never seen this problem myself, and being one who never leech this files, i don't think i will experience them... ;-)

Try clients like BitComet or Azureus and see if you get the same problems. Please enlighten us if you get the same problem or if they work better... :)"
,syllogist,2005-02-07T19:42Z,"Your receptiveness is exemplary DogShitTaco, I will indeed provide you with feedback on any change in perceptions of video quality on my part with the exclusion of some of the other audio tracks. I am hoping that it will atleast improve the quality of motion; nevertheless, this is still one of the best releases i've yet to see. "
