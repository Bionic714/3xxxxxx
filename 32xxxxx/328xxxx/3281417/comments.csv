You have really great files, but half the time, 
your files cannot be opened without editing the name to make them less than 260 characters long in winrar. 
I am grateful to you for uploading cool shit, 
but having to edit all the names just to even open the .rar files because it says 'www.torrentazos.com' 50 times on it is kind of fucked up.  
I may even actually visit your site if you stop trying to compress MP3s with .RAR , MP3 is already compressed.
How much space do you actually gain, like 2 kb per song? 
Thnx."
