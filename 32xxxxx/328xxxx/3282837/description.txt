Hailing from Orlando, Bubzigohn's musical tentacles extend toward elements of avant-pop, space rock, and anti-folk.  His first EP, "The Left-Hand Path to Jahweh's Doorstep" is a seditious rock-opera response to American culture, spun with a mixture of standard instrumentation, synthetic textures, and a swank fetish for nonmusical objects. A Joe's Garage-esque expos√© on the common man, "Jahweh" focuses on Harry, a burrito enthusiast who watches the war in Iraq on TV. Harry works a lowly tech-support job, indulges in internet dating, and occasionally dips into deconstructing the flaws of humanity. Given Bubzigohn's usual knack for the glitchy-chic, the material is a thought-provoking and well-executed musical oeuvre at whose heart lays the classic, good-natured desire to save your soul... or, at the very least, to reprogram your brain waves, you corporate slave.
