S.C.S. - Dangerous Waters will be the first title of its kind, 
  allowing you total control over multiple air, surface, and submarine 
  platforms in a modern-day naval environment! The game allows you to 
  focus your attention and to take direct control of individual crew 
  stations and also plan and execute combined arms naval strategies 
  from a top-down 'Commanders Eye' perspective.

  S.C.S. - Dangerous Waters allows you control of over 10 of the world's
  most potent naval units out of a total of more than 270 civilian
  and military surface, submarine and air units included in the game.

ONE NAVAL BATTLEFIELD
  Cooperative and head-to-head multiplayer modes allow controllable
  submarine, surface, and air platforms to battle it out in the 
  definitive naval combat experience.
  
  INNOVATIVE 'AUTOCREW' ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
  By assigning certain crew stations to be manned by the "virtual crewmen"
  you can hand off various functions for the simulation to manage.
  This allows you to tailor the game's difficulty level to your liking
  and set the precise level of involvement and micro management that
  you desire. You can choose to man every single available crew 
  station yourself, just a few select stations or relinquish control 
  to the A.I. and let the 'autocrew' do the rest. Autocrew control is
  dynamic so you can enable or disable this feature at will for every
  crew station modeled in the game.
