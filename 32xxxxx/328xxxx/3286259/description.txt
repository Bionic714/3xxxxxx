In my opinion Mark Eitzel is one of the best singer/songwriters ever. He played with the critically acclaimed band American music club during the 80s and beginning of the 90s before they split up in 1994. He went from there to make several solo CDs. This radio show was done before the release of the 'Invisible man' which came out 2000-2001, and therefor includes 3 tracks played directly from the CD, aside from the live music, which include tracks from the upcomind CD as well as some old songs, such as 'Take courage'. He has since this show made 2-3 more CDs, and has also re-united with American music club for a new CD, called 'Love songs for patriots' (also definately worth checking out).  I found this live radio show on an old tape, so the quality is what it is.
