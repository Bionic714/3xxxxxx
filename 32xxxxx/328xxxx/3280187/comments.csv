,amazingchicken,2007-03-30T15:22Z,"This is a great collection - but I am looking for something in addition to.  Does anyone have the music Gould played for Soundtrack of the film Slaughterhouse-Five?  All Bach, Gould tweaked and re-tweaked (as he loved to do) the arrangements to something at once beautiful and terrible.  Unfortunately It has not been re-issued on CD and my only audio copy has been 'borrowed.'

Cheers all."
