"Glenn Gould plays Bach" contains most of the recordings of J S Bach performed by Glenn Gould. It includes the English Suites, French Overture, French Suites, Goldberg Variations (from 1955 and 1982), Partitas, Preludes & Fugues, Two- & Three-Part Inventions, and the Well-Tempered Clavier Books I & II.

All recordings are from my personal collection, ripped with Exact Audio Copy, and compressed with LAME.
