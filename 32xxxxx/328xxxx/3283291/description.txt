On October 16, 2002, two months into his world tour in support of The Rising, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band took the stage of the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Spain to create the kind of soul-stirring concert experience that transforms Springsteen neophytes and fans alike into true believers.

Live in Barcelona captures Springsteen and the E Street Band at the peak of their form performing a dream set-list of new songs, classic hits, audience favorites and seldom-heard rarities. Containing more than two-and-one-half hours of music running the course of two DVDs, Live in Barcelona marks the first time an individual Springsteen concert has been released in its entirety. This special DVD release includes Drop the Needle And Pray. The Rising On Tour, a bonus featurette of material never-seen-before including rare live footage, exclusive interviews with Springsteen and E Street band members, and unpublished photos chronicling The Rising tour.
