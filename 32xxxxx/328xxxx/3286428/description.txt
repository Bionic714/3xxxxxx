<p>This film is a masterpiece featuring (as one might expect from Antonioni) a highly gifted, but completely alienated, anti-hero. Unlike Antonioni's former films, however, it was shot in London. The main character tries to get a grip on reality using his camera but ends up in a murder mystery...</p>
