,Jesuz,2005-01-22T13:17Z,Tack! Den här filmen är svin bra xD
,ingenaning,2005-01-22T18:50Z,tackar!!! utan tvekan en av mina topp 5-filmer.
,Moria,2005-01-23T03:17Z,"FAN vilken kul rulle. Stort tack. Fortsätt gärna med andra roliga udda rullar jag inte sett. Alldeles för mycket mainstream på pirate för min smak, men man ska väll inte klaga när det är gratis. 

Igen, tack."
,laageer,2005-07-01T20:24Z,den här filmen suger
,red456,2005-07-23T23:00Z,Is the fucking any good?
,wierdweasel,2005-08-11T04:53Z,your first line is so very true......(weasel)
,SoundWall,2006-07-26T04:10Z,"""I know why you clicked on this torrent.. you couldn't resist after seeing the word incest, could you?  Bunch of perverts! :)""

Actually no... That's, well, really fucking weird.

Anyways, I saw this movie on TV years ago and remember laughing my ass off at one scene. This movie has the most weird kind of humour I've ever seen... and I LOVE IT!!

Thanks a lot for this upload! Wish I could find somewhere to buy this on dvd."
,Temptation,2007-09-28T13:38Z,"ha.. good to see this is still alive and in circulation.  Btw, the audio/video problem I mentioned in the description was a codec problem and nothing to do with the rip.  This rip is fine."
,XenOtai,2007-11-19T17:20Z,This is definitely NOT a comedy. This is a drama film and one of the best films i have ever seen.
,Kamrusepas,2008-02-21T22:17Z,"Been looking for this movie, thanks!"
,lea080424,2008-04-24T22:42Z,Thanks a lot. I realy love this movie!! :)) Could  anybody show an english sub?
,jdb00,2008-05-22T10:11Z,"oddly i was just trying to look for old vids of jackie mason and when i searched this torrent came up cause of the occurrence of 'jackie' and 'mason,' albeit separately. anyway looks interesting, i'll give it a try, thanks, hadn't heard of it. liked mean girls tho, and its the same director. thanks again, cheers"
,pr3ciousroy,2008-07-12T05:38Z,"Actually, XenOtai, you could not be more WRONG.  
It is definitely a comedy. It's what's called a dark comedy. 
If you didn't find this movie insanely hilarious enough to be able to  tell that it's obviously a comedy, then.... something is wrong with you."
,XenOtai,2008-08-07T20:54Z,"Or with you, maybe?.. Everything is relative. And the more opinions the better!"
,JRQuilcon,2009-01-22T23:20Z,"Actually I clicked on it 'cause I love Parker Posey! A truly fine actress! (an' nice boobs, too!)"
