Update EXPERT V6.3

Release Type: Patch Management
Release Date: 22th Jan 2005

iNFO:
Are you having problems validating, reporting, patching applications and 
just generally managing patches on your network? If so, your current
patching approach might be inadequate. Too many patches to track,
unexpected behavior, unreliable scripts and complex reporting schemes are   

replaced by a simple, reliable and comprehensive approach to patch 
deployment management.   

Software patches add risk to maintaining uptime but are required for 
securing your business. IT administrators live with this contradiction
every day. How do you mitigate the risks to uptime imposed by patching
while securing your systems? There is only one solution: find a way to
reliably deploy patches that minimizes the threat to uptime. 

Designed for the IT administrator, UpdateEXPERT automates the process of    
researching patch histories and co-dependencies. Deployment scripting is 
unnecessary, and you do not need to know where patches are applicable.      
UpdateEXPERT uses St. Bernard Software's independent patch management       
metadatabase.
