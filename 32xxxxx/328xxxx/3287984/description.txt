An ambitious yet practical idea, Trilogy underscores the tonal and lyrical connections between three of the Cure's darkest albums in the last 20 years. The restless, ever-changing band, fronted by goth-gloomster Robert Smith, took up residence at the Tempodrom Berlin for a couple of nights in late 2002 for the express purpose of playing the group's 1982 Pornography, 1989's Disintegration, and 2000's Bloodflowers live and in their entirety. Whether it was a good idea or not depends on one's point of view. All three sets are long on droning, funereal rhythm sections, thick guitar lines that carry good pop melodies to overstylized destruction, and Smith's own cracked, morose vocals. On the other hand, fine distinctions emerge: The Disintegration portion of the show is lightest on its feet, with lush orchestration on Plainsong, a hint of swing on Lovesong, and cinematic tendencies in the stirring The Same Deep Water as You. The rest of the concert is numbing.
