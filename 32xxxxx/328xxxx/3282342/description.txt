OK here's another Punk documentary, this time it's an ITV First Tuesday Special called Made In Huddersfield about punks in Huddersfield the last town the Sex Pistols played before going to America. I have also put a new encode of the BBC TV report on the Brixton riots and the 4 Skins, enjoy!

Made In Huddersfield-First Tuesday ITV 1987 SVCD 27 Minutes
4 Skins-BBC TV Report 1981 SVCD 14 Minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. These will fit on 3 x 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
