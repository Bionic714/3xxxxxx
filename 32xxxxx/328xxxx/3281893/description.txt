This cd is fruit of a live show of Ivete Sangalo recorded in 2004 at Salvador, Bahia, for a MTV special. 

Ivete is the most famous name of Brazilian Ax√© Music - a genre of music to dance without stop -, the music that is the swing of Bahia's Carnival! 

Special attention to the musics 3, Flor do Reggae (Reggae flower), and 10, Sorte Grande (Big Luck), this one the great hit of 2005 Brazilian Carnival! 

Regards from Brazil!
