Long awaited side project from Apoptygma Berzerk frontman Stephan Groth. Fairlight Children provides Groth with an outlet for the ideas and
electronic music not compatable within the framework of Apop's sounds.
"Before You Came Along" is the first single lifted from Fairlight Children
debut album "808 Bit". Catchy electro-clash beats meet melodic uptempo
electro-pop.
