You can do this with torrent generators found on the web, or you can use the official BT Client from http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent. You will need to enter 'http://tracker.prq.to/announce'  in the announce url field, if you are uploading to pirate bay. Next, log in to pirate bay and click on 'ladda upp'.
Choose your directory for your torrent, you must enter a name and description, then allocate it 'musikvideo'. You must open the torrent in your client for it to seed. That's it!
Post me when youu are done, 
Good luck!"
