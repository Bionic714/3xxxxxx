if you dont have Daemon Tools, use this link and download it:http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
install it and single click it on the start bar.
click Device 0:[ E:] C:/ and go to the KOTOR file location and click disc 1, and install the game ...
when a pup-up comes that says: please insert disc 2, you simply click browse and click disc 2,
and so it goes to disc 4.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if there is a crack in the file, you go to my computer and right click on DVD/CD drive and click open. you will find a crack there and copy the KOTOR NO-CD crack to your games dir (the game data in KOTOR).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if there isn't a crack located in the games file, you go to http://www.camecopyworld.com
or http://www.gameburnworld.com and write, Star Wars of the old republic.
on the loaded page, you will see a link that says something about this: Star Wars of the old republic NO-CD, Traner, game fixes.
click it, download it and use win-RaR to extract the files to the games dir ... and voila, enjoy playing the game.

,Romborg,2008-11-07T07:15Z,"VISTA users - 
I'm not 100% sure if this will work or not, am downloading it now and will test it...
But one of the biggest culprits for issues with Vista is the UAC.  Turning this off usually corrects a wide variety of issues like the one you're describing.

UAC basically second-guesses the admin privilages that 'admin' users are supposed to have.  Turning off the UAC makes sure that you really do have FULL admin privilages.

Turning off UAC:
(There's probably an easier way, this is just how I do it)
Start - Run - type ""MSCONFIG"" - hit enter.
Go to the ""Tools"" tab.
Find and highlight ""Disable UAC"" and click Launch.
Then click OK (or Apply then OK) and reboot the computer.
Rebooting may not be necessary, but it is always a good idea to do so whenever you make this kind of change.

Let me know if this works. :)"
,Romborg,2008-11-07T07:16Z,"As a PS to all you ""VISTA SUXORZ"" people...  yes, Vista was a bad OS.  But it's not a lost cause. You can configure it to work almost just as well as XP used to.

You just need to have half a brain to know where to look."

,OnyxiaKing,2008-11-27T15:50Z,"OK!!!!!!!!!!!! IGNORE MY LAST COMMENT! THE GAME WORKS ILL EXPLAIN COMPLETLY FOR EVERYONE HOW TO DO IT ON VISTA!!!!!!

Step 1. Extract disc 1 to the file, and run the setup, install the game.  then it sais put in disc 2, then u just use the daemon tool to mount disc 2, by just choosing the disc 2 ""rar"" file, and then go to the SWkotor install setup and chose the SWkotor disc 2 and press continue, and do that with every disk.

Step 2. The game is now installed! Go to the folder named ""crack"", take the crack file, ( the SWkotor start program)  and listen carefully, Drag it to the SWkotor folder in the C:/Program Files! not in the desktop or enything where u had ur normal swkotor map that u download, u must put it in the Lucas Art/Star wars folder in PROGRAM FILES. there u put the crack and just replace the other one. then run the game and it works!!!!!!!!!!!!

,OnyxiaKing,2008-12-07T14:47Z,"Sure Sigster, if ur still here^^.

Step 1.
First you need to download a program, like Limewire, thats where u like get your game from, thats where u download it from.
just install it, if u dont know how to install stuff, im sorry then.

Step 2.
Get a program named DAEMON Tools Lite.
install.

Step 3. Download this torrent, open with Limewire, it will probably automaticly open with limewire if u double click it.

Step 4. The download has started, when its finished, you go to Limewire Library and drag the file to your Desktop.

Step 5. Mount disc 1 to daemon tools by doing exactly like this..  ( explain to rookies :)
you can see these icons on the lower right on your screen, find the red-white lightning sign and u target it and it sais DAEMON Tools Lite.
Right click it and select Virtuell CD/DVD-ROM.
Then it sais Unit 0: [J:] Empty.  this thing doesent matter if it sais [E:] or [D:] it doesent matter, just click it.
i got swedish version and cant translate this, but its the upper box u click. Montage ""blabla"" something.

Step 6.
A square comes up, with the file Documents.
Just go to desktop, click the map Star Wars Kotor thing...
You can see inside, Star Wars KotOR cd1, cd2, cd3 and cd4, click cd 1 to ""mount"" it.

Step 7. Go to ""my computer"" and you can see the Star Wars icon inside on the ""[J:] spot of whatever u get.
Star Wars installation frame comes up, and you select install and that stuff, u must already know, when the install has come to 20% or 25% im not sure, doesent matter, its gona say: Please enter CD 2. this is a tricky part if u dont know what to do, but you just follow step 5 agien, and ""mount"" disc 2 instead this time! and then click continue, and keep doing that when it sais disc 3, and 4!.

Step 8.
Congratulations! your game is now installed, but we still arent done yet ;).
Go to my computer, select ""C"" harddrive.
go to Programs, then LucasArts.
SWKotOR.
You can see a file/program, with the Star wars icon named: swkotor. Delete it!

Step 9.
Go into your SWKotOR file again on your DESKTOP, not program files.
you can see a folder named CRACK.
open the folder and you can see a file named: swkotor. Drag that into your SWkotOR file in PROGRAM FILES.

Now you click the program named ""swkotor"" and a Star wars screen will pop up, saying ""play"", and 3 more options, select PATCH, to update star wars to latest version. when it has updated you can close star wars. and reopen it agien, but this time you select PLAY. a picture of the ebon hawk will pop up and its gona say: please enter play disc, that means disc 1!
do step 5 agien, and select Star Wars KotOR cd1.
Now the game should run properly.

If you cant make it work or understand this, then im sorry, becouse i did my best and a 10 year old could follow these instructions and make it work^^. hope it works for you guys!

WARNING! 1 last thing, this can be very enoying, copy the  swkotor program that you draged from ""CRACK"" folder. Copy it and put 1 in your desktop, becouse it disappeared for me when i restarted my computer, in the Star wars program file.

And 1 more thing! all saved files disappeared as well when i restarted my computer so... i had to start over agien ;)"
,jlava,2008-12-16T04:15Z,"King if your still here I was windering what you mean by ""Go into your SWKotOR file again on your DESKTOP, not program files"" Where is there this file. All i have is a shortcut to game on desktop and the file in program files. Do i need to dowload this crack?"
,OnyxiaKing,2008-12-19T13:51Z,"The file i was talking about there was the file, the main file that you downloaded, maybe its not on ur desktop"
,Shady_Caveman,2008-12-19T14:32Z,"What he means is, there was no 'Crack' folder in the initial download, nor any 'swkotor' files, just four ISOs.

So where did you get your supposed files from?"
,Shady_Caveman,2008-12-19T15:23Z,"Okay, got it working.

First, go to
http://m0001.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_sw_knights_of_the_old_republic.shtml#Knights%20of%20the%20Old%20Republic%20v1.03%20[ENGLISH]%20Fixed%20EXE

And download the file
Knights of the Old Republic v1.03 [ENGLISH] Fixed EXE
by clicking the link listed (Should be the first on in the list.), and then clicking the floppy disk icon on the file you were redirected to.

Download it, and once it's finished, extract the file, do everything in OnyxiaKing's step-by-step guide, and use the 'swkotor.exe' from the file you just downloaded (Roughly 3.8MBs.) every time OnyxiaKing mentions a 'swkotor' file in a crack folder, in his guide. "
,dathip,2008-12-28T08:25Z,guys i got this game working but my textures are all messed up in the game. for example Darth Malak on the start screen is completely sideways instead of standing up. please help ganybody!!!?
,ayrian,2009-01-05T12:43Z,"found solution, will post right after this, need to test."
,ayrian,2009-01-05T12:47Z,"for anyone with an intel graphics card, and crash on startup.

(might also work for other graphics cards)

ok, so i had so much trouble getting this to work, and my computer is vista home edition, and my vid card is an integrated intel crap. everytime i did what everyone else said to do, the game would load as a black screen, then an error would say that it had a problem and had to close. from what i read, this is what most people had in terms of problems.

this issue is not anything wrong with the torrent, or the cracks, or vista (maybe it is vista, but its not just vista), its the graphics card.
here is what i did:"
,ayrian,2009-01-05T12:49Z,"SRY FOR SPLIT I DONT KNOW WHY I COULDNT POST THE FULL THING, ANYWAY, HERE IS REST OF SOLUTION:

1. install game normally with daemon tools/alcohol 120.
2. update it to version 1.03 using the swupdate thing in the game directory.
3. go to the link the person before me gave which goes to game copy world, and download that file.

update your game.

replace the swkotor.exe file in the c:\program files\lucas arts\kotor with the one you just downloaded.

4. right click on the file you just replaced (the cracked swkotor.exe) and go to compatibility and set it to windows xp sp2.

5. run the game, if it doesnt work, go to step 6, if it does, the enjoy."
,ayrian,2009-01-05T12:49Z,"HERE IS LAST PART OF SOLUTION:

6. find your graphics card's settings. for intel cards this is by right clicking on desktop and saying graphics properties.

there are 4 buttons on the bottom left, one is called ""3d settings"", click it.

these are the settings that worked for me:

change all the settings to the following:
asynchronous flip = off
tripple buffering = default
flipping policy = flip
depth buffer bit depth = default
force s3tc texture compression = off
force fxt1 texture compression = off
driver memory footprint = normal
texture color depth = desktop color depth
anisotropic filtering = application control.

im sure nvidia and ati cards also have these options, if you do not have an intel card, try to find the settings for your specific cards and set the settings to similar to what i wrote.

happy gaming everyone."
,ayrian,2009-01-05T13:39Z,"also i forgot to mention:

Apparently a lot of newer gfx cards don't interface well with KotOR, but you can fix the problem by adding a line to the graphics option section of the swkotor.ini file 

Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1

,Erebrus,2009-07-23T17:58Z,"im not sure where the crack is im DL'ing right now and ill post again when i find it, but heres what you do...
1. Download
2. Using whatever program that mounts images to vurtial drives (i use Power Iso) mount the first disk and run setup.exe
3. when the download stops and calls for disk two, close disk one and then mount disk 2, and run autorun.exe
4. Repeat for disk 3 & 4
5. when the game is all downloaded and its done DO NOT RUN!! you need to mount disk one again and go to the CRACK folder. Take the CRACK and extract or just copy it to :C\program files\lucas arts\swkotor and when it says replace and copy click YES!
6. Play game and have fun!!!"

The game runs just fine (if a little stretched on my widescreen) and plays.  It crashes often, but I save more often...  However, I've reached the point where I steal the Ebon Hawk and shoot down the Sith fighters...  And the game crashes before it loads Tatooine.  

I've defeated those Sith fighters about 50 times now...  I thought disabling video would help, or adding the ""Disable Vortex Buffering"" or whatever to the programing would help.  Nothing.

All I wanted was a lightsaber...


If anyone has any solutions (or needs any help getting the game to at least run) contact me at AIM/YIM TarsonR.

Thanks guys."

This is what I did,
1) insert disk or mount image but DO NOT AUTO RUN!!!!
2) Go to my computer and right click KOTOR 1 and click view files.
3) find the install app and right click, choose properties.
4) go to compatability and choose compatability mode for windows XP service pack 2 and run as admin.
5) accept your changes and start the install app.
6) install BUT DO NOT MAKE A SHORTCUT FOR THE GAME.
7) find the game in program files.
8) find the auto- update app and do the same compatability changes as on step 4.
9) once it has updated find the game app called swKoToR.exe (I think) replace with crack and make a shortcut for the desktop.
10) repeat step 4 for the swKoToR.exe
11) start the app
12) when you get to the start menu click CTR-ALT-Delete and choose task manager.
13) Right click the app on the task manager and choose the locate option. ( will say locate process or somthing similair
14) go to the bottom of that panel and choose show for all users (requires admin pass)
15) go back to the programs tab and repeat step 13.
16) right click the app on the processes and click set afinity and choose only ONE of your processors. DISABLE THE REST FOR THE GAME YOU WILL NEED TO DO THIS EVERY TIME YOU PLAY
17) go back to the game and turn off movies and grass
18) PLAY!!!! I have experienced an Auto quit every 50 minutes and am working on a way to work around that if someone finds a solution to that  please post it. but It is now a playable game for VISTA AND WINDOWS 7 YAY!!!!!!!"

For those of you with trouble READ!!!!


Okay everybody, to get the game to function on both win 7 and vista, all you have to do is add the line:

DisableVertexBufferObjects=1

to the graphics option section of swkotor.ini file. You will have to save the file somewhere else, then copy it to the program folder, or if you know how to operate vista and win 7 simply disable the security and save.

Sadly however I've found another problem where the game stops progression. The game goes to the crew quarters of the ebon hawk (just the crew quarters, no other part of the ship is loaded), and there a ""start movie"" inspection blip that you can examine, but nothing happens. The game won't run with a mounted disc or burned for some strange ass reason. Nuts...."

Rustyreaper, your way might work, i'm not sure. I didn't want to have to follow all of those steps, so I messed around with the game. 

To make it run on Windows 7 (Vista might work this way too), do this:

1. Install the game *Autorun does work (I didn't make a shortcut on the desktop, just in case)
2. After install, create a shortcut from the file in the start menu
3. Right click shortcut, and go to the properties
4. Go to the Compatibility tab
5. Check the ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:""
6. Find ""Windows XP (Service Pack 3)""

Then run your game! I've been playing for about an hour and a half, and it hasn't crashed or anything. Have fun!"

3) Downloaded 1.03 fixed game exe crack [english] from GameCopyWorld and replaced the original swkotor.exe in C:\Games\LucasArts\SWKotOR folder (DON'T FORGET TO BACKUP THE ORIGINAL EXE!)
4) Downloaded imagecfg.zip: 
[url]http://www.robpol86.com/images/Imagecfg.zip[/url]

a) Unzipped imagecfg.exe into the C:\Games\LucasArts\SWKotOR folder

c) Navigated to C:\Games\LucasArts\SWKotOR (cd C:\Games\LucasArts\SWKotOR)

You don't unzip the CD's, you mount them to a virtual drive with a program like MagicISO, the program can be downloaded here.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4425537/MagicISO_Maker_5.5___Serial

Once you install it, right click on the ISO file and go to ""MagicISO"", then ""Mount (Filename)"" and select a drive, then go to my computer and you see it like you would a CD/DVD that's in you computer.

,square_fan,2010-10-12T14:43Z,"Thanks man.

Seeding now =]

so far, works perfect.

(i used Daemon tools, and i am on XP)

Tutorial-

Mount each of the images in Daemon tools [or similar, idk if it will change anything.](ALSO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL FOUR DRIVES AT ONCE, NOT NEEDED, BUT EASIER. in daemon tools simply go to Virtual Drives and click the ""add SCSI""

run DISC 1

when prompted to switch discs, go to the browse [next to the text box in the down-loader] and got to the one that says ""KOTOR_2(L:)""

then, repeat, except (when asked) do ""KOTOR_3(L:)""

And once more, for disc 4.[ KOTOR_4(L:))

Nowm it should ask you to insert DISC 4 again, so just repeat. Put in ""KOTOR_4(L:)""""

And you should be home free.

for the download, atleast.

NOW ON TO THE CRACK!

Goto the 4th disc (wherever you saved it to, mine by default is in a ""Downloads"" folder.) it should be called ""Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic CD 4 of 4"",

RIGHT CLICK! and open with WinRAR (or similar Extracting software such as 7Zip.) WHILE IN THE WINRAR DIRECTORY double click on the folder that reads ""Razor1911"" extract that file to the folder where all your discs are (same folder you sued to open up WinRAR for the 4th disc.)

now COPY that file.

Go to ""My Computer"" click the ""Local Disk (C:)"" Click on the folder that reads ""Program Files"" and find the folder in there that says ""LucasArts"" (the people who made KOTOR)

There should be ONE folder in there called SWKotOR, click it.  

Now PASTE the crack [which you should have copied...) in the folder, and when it asks to replace the previous one, click ""yes"".

and there ya go =] the game should work!

I'll seed. and thanks again for this upload!!"

patch the game to 1.03 and download the crack from http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=987

should work without problem, might want to tune down to 64bit if you have Vista and run with compatibility mode.

It's basically D&D awesomeness with a Star Wars old storyline and most of dialogues have voices in the many alien languages Lucas created... wich means... 2 out of 2.4 Go of this torrent are voice files saying stuff like ''gaaawhaa mookia dagoo maktoo ysoo fill too doo too too''

,jajj576,2011-01-31T07:55Z,"By far the most ridiculous game torrent ever. I've downloaded about 25 (i mean all COD's, BFBC2, just cause2, both fallouts) I think, after about 10 hours with a FAST system, I'm done. 

I probably will get it eventually....I always do. But in about 5 minutes of reading, I think you will come across about 3 - 5 completely different ways of doing it. And they don't all work...unless you and the poster have the same OS, etc. In fact....4 out of 5 of them WILL NOT work. It's finding that 5th.

I don't tend to post unless its helpful....so here are a few ""Heads Up"" (old game, long old thread)

*If you have win7*,

Dude put it simple. Install, patch to 1.03 (just run the program), then copy this crack  http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=987 (thanks De_loused), to the install folder C:/Program...SWNotOR. I think that should do it...didn't for me yet

**this only got me to the Lucasarts symbol. then it closes. None of the tips have helped, however i put the App files in Comp. mode XPSP2..and my system has finally made it to yellow light in config (no need to list specs...nothing exists game wise that will even test it)

You may have better luck...I feel like ""patch to 3.01 and copy crack SHOULD work. 

Everyone else...
XP should have no prob. There are several good posts..install (daemon tools, XXXX iso, etc. Don't have em? Search for em /\ )
                                                    l
Patch, copy no cd crack, off you go.

I'm going to attempt one more re-install...and just because it works for you, doesn't mean everyone else is WRONG. I assume us WIN 7 ULT 64bit are having the same issue. Best o luck

Go to Options (press ESC key)
then go to Graphics
turn OFF the Shadows and Grass
then click Advance options
set the quality to Medium or Low
set Anisotropy to 2x

that's it. the game should run fine without those broken lines or distortions, plus when the movies play, there are no lags or certain pauses or crashes.

*I recommend this to those who does not have any fancy graphics/video card on their machines, like I do and also I recommend this to those experiencing my said errors with the game. my game went smooth as silk after setting those settings. you don't need super good quality of graphics to be able to play the game anyway, better smooth running :P

,awl19,2011-09-04T15:44Z,"Windows 7 64-bit user here to address several problems.

(NOTE: These fixes obviously only work if you have exactly the same issues that I had.)

1. Crash at start or while flying to new planets in the Ebon Hawk
    -Many users have discussed how to fix this but I will reiterate it. Open ""launcher.exe"" and click on ""Configure"" then check the ""Disable Movies"" box. You won't miss much content by disabling them and it's much more beneficial since you will now actually be able to play the game.

2. Character stops, becomes still, won't move
    -This only happened to me for about the first 2 hours maybe about 20 times and my ""fix"" is fast enough that it really isn't inconvenient. All you need to do is just save the game when you become ""stuck"" and then load that saved game again and you come back with the freedom to move again. It takes you maybe 10 seconds out of your game play for each save and load.

3. Cheats (bonus tip, not a fix)
    -Copy ""swkotor.ini"" from your game directory to any folder (can't be edited and saved within the directly) then open it in notepad and start a new line anywhere with ""EnableCheats=1"" then save it and copy/paste it back into the game directory. Go into the game and simply hit the ~ (tilde) key and it opens your ""console"" where you can type commands. All the cheats are available at: http://www.cheatcc.com/pc/starwarskotor.html#.TmLYc44a-yZ

Also I want to address the people who are whining that the torrent is corrupt or doesn't work. This is not the case. This is an old game and it's hard to get it running on new software it was never designed to run on. As a side note, I did run the 1.03 patch and used the crack appropriate for that patch (downloads available in comments)

Happy gaming."

I've downloaded the torrent, mounted each image (ISO) as Daemon Tools Lite requested. After I've installed the game completely, I run the .exe and it says that openGL isn't supported by my graphics card. I don't have openGL, but I do have Directx 9.0 that works great.

Uninstalled, reinstalled, updated to 1.03, FAAB error with no crack installed. Installed 1.03 cracked .exe, no error, nothing happens after splash.

,maroonylife,2012-01-28T16:49Z,"WORKS on Win7 x64.

Install, manually do the 1.03 update (google it), get a no-cd crack for 1.03 from gamecopyworld.com, and then enjoy!

Sidenote; do not trust your self-made shortcuts. Open the game manually from the autorun or from the game. I don't know why but autorun and direct-exe don't work at the same time, and interestingly the working one differs from day to day (must have same registry problem with OS being win7, im not sure. Bottom line: GAME IS ABSOLUTELY PLAYABLE). once you get into the game, the only bug you can experience is, being unable to use the movement keys after some of the fights, solution is simple; quick save, quick load, solved. 

Enjoy!

Thanks for the torrent, GREAT GAME!"

the game works perfectly for me thanks to fbbt's advice. I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit.

what I did was mounted and installed the 4 iso's

then I took the crack out of the disc 4 inside Razor 1911 folder and replaced the one on the game directory.

Then I updated it on the menu, but right in the end it said that the crack was not correct so I downloaded a 1.03 patch from this site:

http://www.gamershell.com/download_4492.shtml

then i run the patch, and copy and replaced the swkotor.exe and mss32.dll i downloaded from this site

,rockjon2,2012-03-19T05:54Z,"[ PLEASE READ TO PREVENT CRASHES ON VISTA/WINDOWS 7 ]

Follow mrpale's instructions to the tee, and then, after everything is complete, go to ""swkotor.ini"" in the swkotor program files folder. Once there, look for the heading, ""[Game Options]."" Underneath this heading, copy and paste this:

Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1 

And it should allow you to view cutscenes without the game crashing. It worked for me, so here's hoping it works for you.

Playing in Xp sp3."
,AppGenius,2012-06-25T12:37Z,"This torrent is great. The game works fine and everything, if you have a computer that is fast enough to run games, then the game will run even better. The game does work on Windows 7 however it will not work when you first download the game, you will need to make some adjustments and modifications first. What you need to do is easy. Just follow mrpale's instructions on how to get the game working on Windows 7, visit comment page fourteen. If you get a screen that comes up which is an error message and it displays some unrecognisable symbols or the game doesn't start at all, you need to download the crack from this site:
http://www.gamershell.com/download_4492.shtml
Go to this site, then click the link at the top which says 1.03 English fix exe. Download this file and update your game by running the patch. Once you have done this, download a crack from this site:
http://m0004.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_sw_knights_of_the_old_republic.shtml#Knights%20of%20the%20Old%20Republic%20v1.03%20[ENGLISH]%20Fixed%20EXE
You will go to the adfly advertisement but all you have to do is to just wait a few seconds and then click the skip ad button at the top right corner of the screen. Then download the file from one of the mirrors over there and when you finished downloading it, you will find two things, a swkotor.exe file and an mss32.dll. What you need to do is to take both of these files and paste them in the Kotor game file which can be found at computer, then system, then program files and then Lucasarts and then SWKotOR, click replace when you are prompted to keep both files or cancel. Mrpale told you to replace the crack that was already in the Lucasarts SWKotOR file with the crack that was in the Razor 1911 folder of the fourth CD in this download. You can do that, but make sure that you replace the Razor 1911 crack with the crack that you downloaded from the GameCopyWorld site. You have to replace the Razor 1911 and then only will the game work, do not worry about the Razor 1911 crack, throw it away, you need to worry about the one from GameCopyWorld. Download the crack from the GameCopyWorld and replace the crack from the folder Razor 1911 (if you put it in the Lucasarts SWKotOR folder, if you didn't, then just put the one from the GameCopy world into the game folder at program files) with the one that you downloaded from the GameCopyWorld site. You need to replace the mss32.dll file from the GameCopyWorld site, the game folder in program files will have an mss32.dll file so you need to download the one fro GameCopyWorld and replace the original. After this, the game should work fine. You shouldn't get the strange error symbols message and you should be able to start the game on Windows 7. This is very simple. You are just downloading the patch from the site and updating the game, and then you are downloading the swkotor crack and the mss32.dll file from GameCopyWorld and you are replacing the files that the game came with, with these files that you downloaded from the indicated sites. An awesome way to cheat in this game is to download the savegame editor, download it from here:
http://www.gamefront.com/files/9360981/kse_332.zip
You will learn how to use it quickly by yourself as it is very simple to use."
,AppGenius,2012-06-25T12:44Z,"Another point regarding the savegame editor, some of you may be experiencing some sort of glitch. After you finish the Endar Spire mission and you see the cutscene of you escaping through the escape pods, you will find yourself in an incomplete Ebon Hawk, where you are trapped and there is a ""cutstart"" object in the middle of the ship. If this happened to you, then you are lucky because there is a fix for this, all you have to do is to go to the following site:
http://www.starwarsknights.com/tools.php
And download the one in the middle that says KotOR 1 Fixed Cutscene Files for KSE. After you done that, open this download with Winrar and just take all of the files from this download and move them to your game folder (the one which is located in computer, program files, Lucasarts, Swkotor) and after you done that, it should work fine, it was a very good fix and it should work for you. If it doesn't work which is highly unlikely, then just make sure that you are still a scoundrel, scout or soldier, you need to be one of the three original classes and you also need to make sure that you are still a male or a female. After all of this, the game should work fine and the cutscene errors shouldn't happen when you use the savegame editor."
,AppGenius,2012-06-26T02:39Z,"For those of you who are experiencing crashing, you can try this. Write the Line ""Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1"" in the swkotor.ini file in your game folder that is located in program files. This should let you view cutscenes and play the game without the problem of crashing. You can also try to find a fix online. Also make sure that your game is updated to a 1.03 version and make sure that you have the right crack pasted in the game folder in program files, the right crack is not the one that comes with the torrent in the Razor 1911 folder, that is not the right one, the right one is mrpale's link, here it is:
http://m0004.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_sw_knights_of_the_old_republic.shtml#Knights%20of%20the%20Old%20Republic%20v1.03%20[ENGLISH]%20Fixed%20EXE
Go to this site and download the file that says v1.03 English fix. Download that and make sure that you add the swkotor crack that you got from this site into your program files folder and not the Razor 1911 one. The problem of crashing may also have something to do with the mss32.dll file that the game came with, this game is usually shipped with a bad copy of this file, an easy way to fix this is to get one of the internet yourself and replace the faulty one. The link that I provided you with in this comment should give you two things which are the swkotor crack (the right one that you should put into the game folder of kotor in program files and not the Razor 1911) and the mss32.dll file, so take these two files and replace the files that are already in the game folder with these ones and that should make your game work fine. Also there is the issue that some of you may not get the game to start, you press start but the game doesn't open and also you may get an error message that displays some funny looking characters that you can't understand, that is easy to fix, all you have to do to fix this is to download the two files from the link in this comment and replace the files in the kotor game folder in program files, so this link can solve two problems for you. Try writing the line in the swkotor.ini file first, that will most probably fix the problem."

,gen1n,2012-07-31T17:19Z,"ok, i got past the ""insert cd"" error, now when the game starts, it starts with the picture of a space ship then black screen then it shows that the game has crashed..... any comments?  (i tried disabling the movies and also adding a line in swkotor.ini file)"
,glgraw,2012-08-02T23:28Z,Can someone help me? I downloaded this and didn't get any isos.  I got 4 winrar files and when I extracted them there were no image files.

THE GAME DOES NOT INITIALLY WORK, BUT IT CAN, GIVEN A FEW TWEAKS.

Firstly, download the game and mount it with an ISO burner. I used Deamon Tools.
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads
Once it is installed, mount each of the four (4) .RAR files to a separate virtual disc, and start burning CD1. When the program asks you for the location of CD2, select the virtual drive that you placed CD2 in.

Once this is completed, you should be able to install and launch the game. However, because KotOR is only compatible on up to Windows XP, several problems may (most likely, will) occur.

The first thing you'll want to do when you start the launcher is to update the game. After you have done so, to assure that you have the correct update, download the most recent fix from one of the several websites that have the proper files needed to make the game compatible. I used the 1.03 update file from cnet:
http://download.cnet.com/Star-Wars-Knights-of-the-Old-Republic-1-03-patch/3000-7536_4-10266938.html
This file will be named ""swkotor.exe"", you must copy this file into your program files from KotOR. Be sure to backup your current swkotor.exe file by dragging it to the desktop. Once the file is in place, run the update from the launcher. It should not detect any updates.

Next, you'll notice that the game crashes immediately after the opening logos. This is fixed by re-launching the game, and selecting ""CONFIGURE"" on the launcher. Under ""DISABLE MOVIES"" check ""YES"", and under screen resolution, set it to 800x600; you can change it later on, and even make it widescreen.

Next, you're going to want to patch the game for widescreen usage, if you prefer. I used the widescreen program at this site:
http://www.wsgf.org/software/star-wars-knights-old-republic
Please note, that when you change the default resolution, that it will NOT matter what it is set to, in game. It will remain at 1920x1080 if you choose that resolution. Another thing to note is the HUD. When the resolution is changed, the HUD elements stay where they would be if the game was running on a 4:3 aspect ratio. The aforementioned site also has a fix to this.

Another thing you may want to do is to use the cheat console. To do this, find the game's swkotor.ini file in the director, and open it with a program such as Notepad++:
http://notepad-plus-plus.org/
Find the file called ""swkotor.ini"" in your KotOR game folder. Edit the file with Notepad++ and under the line [Game Options] add the following line:
EnableCheats=1 
BE SURE TO SAVE THE FILE AS .ini, NOT A .txt FILE

Finally, it is worth noting that almost all graphical changes made in the ""OPTIONS"" menu will crash the game. I do not consider these options (Anti-Aliasing, Shadows, Grass) vital, they're just something extra. Sometimes, you can get the game to save an action, even if it crashes the game, but I wouldn't lose too much sleep over any of it.

That's it! You're done! Have fun drowning in nostalgia. Remember to save often using F4!

,LordDarkwolf,2012-08-19T22:33Z,"I've been looking at a fix to the resolution problems I've been having and can't find any.  The link below to the wsgf.com site doesn't load properly and searching the site points to a few threads where they are talking about having to patch the code themselves.  I'm a gamer, not a programmer.  If I was a programmer I would read the code and write the fix myself.  Can anyone help with this issue?"
