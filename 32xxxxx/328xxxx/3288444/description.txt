Feh, LokiTorrent is dead so the long description I wrote out is gone. I'm lazy so I'll keep this short.

This is Unreal Tournament, Game of the Year edition, bundled with all four bonus packs, ChaosUT v1.1 mod, an updated OpenGL driver, 436 patch, crack, and Daemon Tools.

The sorta complicated instructions for installation are included in the .nfo file.
