,Sarre,2005-02-09T14:20Z,"Because it's a 90min episode?

Duh."
,allceleb,2005-02-09T20:52Z,"Well, 60 minute episodes are usually arond 350mb.

So wouldn't a 90-minute episode be another 33%, or about 475mb?"
,mimrik,2005-02-09T23:29Z,no is arond 350mb on 45min and 700 is 90min
,allceleb,2005-02-11T20:35Z,"Well, this episode isn't 90 minutes without commercials either.  It's only 33% longer than a standard episode, but the file download is 50% larger. 

That's what the original commenter's point was.

Personally I'm happy to get the better quality. :)"
