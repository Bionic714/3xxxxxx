     The Silent Poets, whose sound seemed focused on a slow, dubby,
     slightly Techno tinged sound on their premiere album, have
     broadenen their focus a bit welcoming French rapper Menelik and DJ
     Jimmy Jay, Last Poets members Jalal and Sulieman, and Ranking Ann.
     They may have broadened, but they have far from diluted themselves.
     The arrangements seem tighter and the beats fatter. This new
     balance may be, in part, thanks to the talents of the guests, like
     the Last Poets, and Menelik, whose track "Un Petit Rien De Jazz"
     from 1993's "Les Cools Sessions" practically _made_ that album.
     Lyrics in English and French.
