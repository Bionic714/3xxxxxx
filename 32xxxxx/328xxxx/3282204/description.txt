Two strangers awaken, chained side-by-side to the wall of a filthy bathroom. Neither knows how they came to this awful predicament, nor what might await them. But the man lying on the floor and missing part of his head might be a clue. Soon, they'll discover they are the latest victims of a maniac who makes his own amusement by pitting two strangers in gory, life-and-death situations.
