[V],velvetfog,2005-01-26T23:59Z,"Please upload your movies as AVI files. AVI files are not compressible, since they are already compressed. Applying WinRAR or WinZIP to them will not reduce their size. Segmented RAR archives are just a nuicance to deal with."
,Munda,2005-01-27T10:01Z,I just upload them in their orginal format
,badm,2005-02-03T10:56Z,"@velvetfog

they are uploaded to FTP as segmented rars, thats how it's always done., 15mb rar files (scene rules and such). Originally to prevent having to replace the whole file when there's a corruption.
Either way, just be grateful he uploads it at all.
Thanks for the movie Munda."
