Digitally remastered for its 30th anniversary theatrical re-release, D.A. Pennebaker's Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars comes on as a slightly dusty, but still darkly glittering jewel of a film, capturing the feeling of a night in 1973 that marked the end of an era in rock and social history. The film documents a day in the life of Ziggy Stardust (a persona adopted by David Bowie the year before), both backstage and in concert. Most importantly, the heart of the film - the music - is improved upon by Tony Visconti, Bowie's long-time producer, whose remix of the soundtrack corrects the sound quality concerns that delayed the movie's initial release, truly making this a must-see for all music fans. The film has some rich backstage moments: a distracted Bowie, puffing on a cigarette, gets his make-up, jewelry and costumes applied by an army of nameless dressers; Bowie's then-wife Angela, a life-size platinum blonde kewpie doll, exclaims breathlessly and joyously in a Melanie Griffith-style voice about the multitude of fans and limousines outside the theater; and a hirsute and chubby Ringo Starr chatting with Bowie as the latter prepares to get into yet another form-fitting gender-bender costume.
