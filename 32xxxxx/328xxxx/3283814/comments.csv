,bikes.,2005-02-01T16:42Z,Is it hard subbed? If not is there an english sub maybe? :)
,sweetmaster,2005-02-01T18:05Z,Hard subbed? The sub is a standalone file which you can enable / disable to your liking if that's what you're wondering about. hehe
,bikes.,2005-02-01T23:58Z,"Well, it can be a separate file, and its possible to burn the subtitle in the avi, so you cant get rid of it anymore.
So as for my first question i got the right answer :) And is there english subtitle available?"
,sweetmaster,2005-02-02T08:48Z,"Unfortunately, there is no english sub I think. On the DVD there is only swedish, norwegian and danish."
,bikes.,2005-02-02T13:17Z,okay nevermind :)
