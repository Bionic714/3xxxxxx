Seriously, don't download this shit. tobbe2 probably converted this movie from a 200mb .rmvb to .avi using amateur tools. Crappy quality, I highly recommend you to DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS.

megavideo quality picture.  definitely watchable but very pixelated and blocky. tolerable but I've seen much better for a 667mb file.

,patisallano,2011-10-03T00:46Z,"The video quality is not the best in the world, and for those of us that enjoy watching AVI's by USB on the TV, the quality is immensely pixelated. There is sound for like 15 seconds and then silence.

It guess it's great for watching on a monitor from 1992, though."
,SammoSammy,2011-11-01T08:47Z,"I recently got a TV that can play things from USB. When I went to watch this, I encountered the same problems as patisallano. Pretty sure it will still work fine on a computer, but I would recommend another download for use with a TV. "
,SammoSammy,2011-11-01T08:51Z,"Unfortunately, it's the only .avi with seeders. 

Looks like I'll never see this film on my TV. "
