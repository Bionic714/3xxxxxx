Movie Info: 

The third film in the successful JAWS franchise follows yet another great white shark with a taste for humans, this time invading the opening ceremonies of a 

marine park in Florida. The brand new complex offers visitors the chance to view the undersea kingdom from the safety of glass tunnels on the seabed. When a 

35-foot great white breaks into the structure--seemingly in revenge for the death of its progeny--a group of marine biologists must do battle with the mighty 

mother beast.
