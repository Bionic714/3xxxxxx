The *.rar main is missing from this archive. You can't decompress the files to make the original file.

This file is a waste of time to download and should be deleted."
,spiderfix,2005-02-17T20:58Z,"compressed with some third party compressor.

To the uploader...the world is either *.zip or *.rar so get with the program.

Sending users on wild-goose chases is wasting everyones time.

If you can't compress with rar then stick to the warez forums."

If you bothered to read up a bit... Quite a few larger release groups has switched to 7-zip. It's perhaps the leanest compression format that exists today.
If you can't fucking find yourself to download a small archiver application, you can go buy these DVDs for $20-$30 a piece yourself instead...

As I said, whining is moronic... 

For those who's old enough to remember, there was a time when arj and ace were two hot and had-to-use compression formats. These things move forward... RAR is a shareware, closed-source compression. And 7-zip compresses better, and is ""free""..."
