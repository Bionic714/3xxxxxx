  . In the future the government watches over everything for the "safety of .
    the public,"  society is under their complete control.  Cyber links are
    implanted into each newborn child, marking their host with a unique ID.
    Cities  have  turned into monstrous urban centers giving the term urban
    sprawl a hazardous new meaning.

    graduate of the police academy, an excellent student and an exceptional
    athlete. On this morning,  she wakes up thinking that  this day will be

    terror attacks plaguing the city will place her directly in the path of
    an evil genius.
