http://www.dcegames.com/support/int/support_patch.php3?id=91

install the patch and download the nocd crack v. 1.22 from the link above  :)"
,Ervin,2005-02-05T18:30Z,"Ok so how do you install the game from the beginning then? I have the patch, but it says that I have to install the game first? How do I do that when all I have is two files that none of my programs can handle? Please help me! "
,Meesh,2005-02-07T22:05Z,"of course you install the game before the patch... heh...

try getting your hands on either alchohol 120% or daemon tools and use those to mount the iso's (cd - images). There's plenty of guides on the net how to do it.

Install from a mount-drive or burn the images...
follow the info in the .nfo file (it can be read in notepad)"

,Yoshiko,2005-03-07T23:32Z,"Thank you all for providing bit torrent service. I would have regretted it very much to actually spent a single cent for this. And I pride myself that I buy all games I like and -play-

In short: This is POS software. Thank you."

I'll also post a comment if I am able to get that cunting 0.8%...if you don't see anything further from me---DON""T BOTHER, IT""S LONG-DEAD!!!"
