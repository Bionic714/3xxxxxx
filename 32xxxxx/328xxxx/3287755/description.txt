-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is perhaps the most distinctive and artistic project Vince Gill
has released to date, an amazing array of traditional styles displaying
his versatile talent. Going back to his roots as he has not done in too
many years, Gill shines like God's brightest penny, and even Tony Brown's
usual heavy-handed production style seems to be as light as an angel's
feather this time around. Gill is in fine voice throughout, joining with
a colorful cast of backup singers to create music that modern mainstream
country radio has not played in well over a decade. With 13 tracks, Gill
eases gracefully from one style to another. From a classic hillbilly waltz
to the edgy Bakersfield sound. He even skillfully tips his hat to guitar
great Roy Nichols on the soon-to-be-classic "There's Not Much Love Here
Anymore." A duet with honky tonk songbird Patty Loveless, "My Kind of Woman
/My Kind of Man," stands proudly next to the best country duets by George
and Tammy or Merle and Bonnie Owens. Most impressive is "Kindly Keep It
Country," a stone-cold country hit that details one man's heartbreak and
the soothing effects of a jukebox and a bar stool. As heartbreaking as any
song ever written is "Let Her In," told from the perspective of a divorced
father who is trying to rebuild his life and still retain his relationship
with his daughter. Just as effective is "The Hills of Caroline," a mountain
tune with a strong melody and story that is enhanced by the beautiful backing
vocals of Alison Krauss. The title cut, which is also the final cut, is
endearing and comes directly from Gill's relationship with his late father.
For emotional depth, honesty, and musical accomplishment, this is certainly
Gill's crowning achievement to date.
