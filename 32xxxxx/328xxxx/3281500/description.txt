Here's a simple truth – most of the people you meet in life are sound asleep! They think that they're awake, yet their lives are governed by habit and ritual rather than choice. Most of what happens in their lives seems to be outside their own control.

They are the "sheeple" who throng the malls, fill the cubicles and factories and... they are all around us. They are all trying to Do The Right Thing, the one thing that will allow them to escape their current condition and attain "success". And success is always somehow just beyond their reach, which makes them feel as though they just can't Do The Thing Right.

The problem is – they've been taught that both success and the resources needed to attain success are outside themselves! It may have been true as an infant, but it surely is a lie today! And that accumulation of experience based on an outmoded premise had been holding them down, holding them back. Making them sheeple.

The truth is, you can free yourself from the dead weight of previous conditioning. If you're Human, you have a pulse, and you are willing to admit that what you were doing before isn't working for you now, you can open up to new learnings. You get to decide just who you're going to become. While you do this, you learn how to design and get futures for yourself that will really, Really work for you!
