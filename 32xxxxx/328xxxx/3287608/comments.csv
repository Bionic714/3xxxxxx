,olson,2005-02-10T06:32Z,"If you have problem with the ""Can't allocate..."":

Try it once, the client will create the main directory for the DVD but will give you the error message. Sets prefs for the client that it should NOT auto-resume, and close it.
Start the client again and point to the directory, it then worked for me.

There's no seeder right now, though, but 125 peers with up to 28% to download from..."

,PUCCA,2005-03-25T17:03Z,"The win in 10 meal plan is 30 pages just in english. If I have some free time to scan these pages, I´ll make a pdf and upload it. could take a few days though. Just search for ""winsor"" in a few days, I´ll call it ""Winsor The win in 10 meal plan"" or something like that. + I´ll scan the traveling guide and include that in the folder."

,rehmbrandt,2005-05-24T07:51Z,Hey PUCCA. I´ve tried to download disc two with both the different torrents you´ve uppload to share disc two. The first one refused to start downloading. The one with the shortest namne worked. Don´t you think that´ll be worth to try even with disc three?
,Mews,2005-05-24T18:37Z,Jeg får ikke til å laste ned denne. Hjelp!
,Mews,2005-05-24T18:39Z,"""Contains an invalid path"" står det."
,rehmbrandt,2005-05-25T23:29Z,"Jag hade samma problem, efter att ha testat Lord & Comet. Testade då BitTornado. Det startade nedladdningen. Men se upp. Tornado tar inte med mappen med det långa filnamnet. Den måst du fixa själv. Det bör dock inte vara svårt. Filnamnet finns ju i den torrent du laddar med. Laddningen bör du nu kunna fixa. hämta bra Tornado och kör med istället för, vad det nu är du har. Trist lapp att titta på, men här funkade det;)"
,PUCCA,2005-05-30T10:26Z,"I could upload a new torrent of DVD 3, but that will take a while, since I don´t have any space to spare on my disc yet. Maybe in a week or two. Just search for it then, Can call it Winsor Pilates DVD3 or something like that. Keep seeding the other Winsor torrents, and enjoy."
,krille70,2005-06-05T07:56Z,"To All.
I try to download this with BitTornado. But I get a strange error messages which is this: Couldn't allocate dir - [Error 2] No such file or directory. What is the problem then I don't understand whar seems to be the problem. Has anybody this problem too. Should I update my BitTornado? I use BitTornado T-0.3.7. 
Yours Christer."
