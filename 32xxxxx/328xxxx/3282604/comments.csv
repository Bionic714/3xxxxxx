I use this appl since 11/2004 and it works very fine.

This evening i sent it by e-mail to a friend and AVAST told me that it's a virus (i've scanned it just before with the same avast!) . But it's not a virus, only the name looks like it, and so avast cries a little bit....

Fake error messages/Phish tools (Certain CyDoor or other banner ads)
Bad Jokes / Pranktools (Trembler is one)
