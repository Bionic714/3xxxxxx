Release info:

I recorded this directly from the

computer. This night (29th of June)
swedish radio P3 broadcasted live
directly from the Roskilde festival in
Denmark, among with all the major
channels in Europe.

I haven't seem this one on the scene,
so this may be the only recordning of
New Order at Roskilde 2002 there is ;)

Enjoy and spread the music!
