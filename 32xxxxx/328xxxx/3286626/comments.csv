,astro2,2009-10-02T03:53Z,"WHAT THE FU CK is wrong with you people !!!

the dvd doesn't work, it has no audio. How do i know? 

i usually test it before i burn it such sa convert to an image, mount the image and watch it like a normal dvd (audio is not there)

THEN i just simply opened one of the VOB files just like a normal media file (original file) and STILL no audio

this torrent needs to be REuploaded"
