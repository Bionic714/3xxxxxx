,ruben123abc,2005-02-17T20:40Z,"Hard disk drive is an integral part of every computer. It stores all your information. One of the most prevalent defects of hard drives are bad sectors on the disk surface. Bad sectors are a part of the disk surface which contains not readable, but frequently necessary information. If your hard drive is damaged by bad sectors, it is not only becomes unfit for use, but also you risk losing information stored on it. If you suspect that your hard disk drive is damaged and contains bad sectors, you have difficulties to copy data from your disk, your operating system is unstable or you unable to boot to Windows altogether - don’t rush to throw out your disk and don’t think that your important information is irretrievably lost. Take advantage of HDD Regenerator - the unique program for regeneration of hard disk drives. HDD Regenerator will regenerate your hard drive by magnetic reversal. As a result, not readable damaged information will be restored. With all this going on, the existing information will not be lost! HDD Regenerator regenerates hard disk drives exclusively at physical level. It ignores file system and can be used with FAT, NTFS or any other file system, and also with unformatted or unpartitioned disks. During regeneration, the disk structure is not changed and the existing data is not affected."
