,deru.exe,2005-01-24T00:23Z,"Are the german episodes dubed or do the actors talk pure german?
German monty python sounds creepy to me... =)"
,GraciaEtewen,2005-01-25T16:49Z,"Actually it's the actors talking german, they had a person translate their sketches for them and then teach them to say it, but the actors have no real clue what they are saying ... :-)"
,modul,2005-01-26T00:57Z,"Unfortunately it's only one of the German episodes on this DVD. The second one here consists of some of the regular English sketches dubbed into German, it's not the proper second German episode.

Still, great work!"
,pederbc,2005-01-26T17:44Z,"Thanks, Modul, for the info. I thought it was, but I haven't actually seen them. I will see if I can track the missing episode."

,meatwaad,2005-08-01T07:20Z,"I dont like video quality with these 5 DVDR. Videos are just 352x480 and with *watermark* in upper left corner. Its really a waste of DVDR capacity for such a low quality videos. Instead you should download 10GB or 7GB torrents:

,meatwaad,2005-08-01T07:22Z,"10GB one has german episodes too, 7GB one doesnt have them."
