Om reunites one of the most powerful rhythm sections in rock music; Al Cisneros [bass, vocals] and Chris Hakius [drums] both ex-members of the legendary Sleep. "Variations on a Theme" is comprised of three long songs employing a series of rhythmic chants whose cadence-like textural drive conveys flight. The album's numerous lyrics serve as symbolist vehicles to a state outside the field of time and space.

"Variations on a Theme" is a series of vibrations and flow. The opening track, "On The Mountain at Dawn" is the thematic blueprint of the entire album; a transportive series of differentiated verse with sets of solid groove. "Kapila's Theme" furthers the motif while the closer "Annapurna" breaks the spell, where the final wash of sound reflects the infinite.

 "With no guitars, you better believe the bass is pumped up on this album. This is one serious, serious fucking bass tone going on here... both buzzing and earthshaking. Easily one of the most massive ever committed to tape. The drums lumber along (not behind) the bass, retaining much of the meditating, deliberate pounding that was featured on Dopesmoker. The vocals were the biggest surprise, as they were not the throaty, distant voice found on the last Sleep offering, but a much more up-front, 'clean' style of voice that closely resembles that of Holy Mountain. I can imagine some might grumble at the more distinct vocals, but in truth, if they were mixed any lower they would be completely overpowered by the bass. The three tracks contained on this record (ranging from 11 to nearly 22 minutes each) create a dense, monolithic environment for the mind of the listener to wander. Still, each track works perfectly well on its own, so this is a rare case of the sum of the parts equaling the whole. Much of the variance in the tracks resides in the cadence of the vocals, as 'riffs' in the common sense don't really apply here. In many ways, one must listen to this record with the same ears as those reserved for bands such as sunn O))), 5ive, Sons Of OTIS, etc., in that it must be 'actively' listened to... focus on the waves of sound and eventually they will take over the controls. I found that by concentrating on the downstrokes in the drumming I was able to elevate my listening plane in a much more efficient manner, but individual techniques vary. ... I am infinitely pleased with this record. It retains the same vibe I got from Sleep, only more progressive and interesting. ... Highest possible recommendation."
