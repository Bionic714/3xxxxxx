[T],pctorrent,2005-02-02T14:30Z,"English? What's english? Perhaps I prefer not to speak your charming english. My english is not good but I can speak with education.
Anyway, What's the problem with this torrents? It's so terrible we use this tracker for people who don´t speak english can enjoy fims? If you don't understand them Don´t download them, it's easy. I would like knowing your language and I know I'm losting the opportunity to download many files from you. There are many sites where people can get not dubbed film but sometimes it´s necessary give another option isn´t it?
Lest´s be more friendly ok? World will be better ;-)"
