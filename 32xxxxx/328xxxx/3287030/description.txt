An old RPG from 1995 for the SEGA Mega CD system. It's a complete iso with cda compressed as mp3 (not done by me so don't complain if you're not satisfied).
Hi-res covers are included for the japanese, american and european versions.
Haven't played this one myself, but I bet it's good :P

Easiest way to play is in a emulator like Gens+ for XP. Have fun!
