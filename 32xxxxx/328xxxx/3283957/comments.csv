    BURN YOUR OWN PLAYSTATION 2 COMPATIBLE MOVIE, MP3 MUSIC and RETRO GAME DISCS!

    The world's most powerful cheat code system and video game enhancer just got even better!

    Bringing revolutionary CD-R and media player features to the PlayStation 2 for the first time, Action Replay MAX once again takes PlayStation 2 game enhancement to a higher level - as only Datel knows how.

    With Action Replay MAX the PlayStation 2 suddenly becomes the centre of your digital lifestyle with exciting new functionality including MP3, the most popular movie file formats, CD-R compatibility, USB Flash drive support, PS2 online chat and even a retro games emulator.

    Using the bundled MAX Media Creator software for PC, you can now burn a CD-R that will function on any standard PlayStation 2 console – no need to invalidate your console's warranty by tinkering with the hardware. This incredible new capability is both easy to use and immensely powerful.

    Now you can create your own custom-made PS2-compatible discs containing MP3 music, movies and even retro Genesis/MegaDrive games. Experience them all through your PlayStation 2, only with Action Replay MAX.
    And that's not all…

    Packed with even more playable cheat codes than ever, and boasting the best code support of any video game enhancer, Action Replay MAX once again leads where others only dare to follow.

    Action Replay MAX is packed with more gamebusting codes than ever, allowing you to beat any PS2 game with a whole host of 100% unofficial cheats that you won't find anywhere else. Instantly acquire MAX health, ammo and money. Unlock secret characters, levels, vehicles and much, much more. Blast your games wide open!

    Action Replay's Advanced Code Engine (A.C.E.) will automatically download a game's codes direct to your PlayStation 2, in many cases before that game is even available at retail. What's more, Action Replay is the only cheat code system that will then automatically recognise your new PS2 game release, taking you straight to the specific codes for it. So why wait around until “Day One” for codes?

    Not got broadband? No problem. It's still so easy to get the latest codes in a flash. Action Replay includes support for USB Flash drive, or you can download new codes to a CD-R and then load them into Action Replay on a standard PS2 .

    New codes can still be entered by hand using a standard PlayStation 2 game pad, or via a compatible USB keyboard such as Datel's own PowerBoard.

    Action Replay MAX is quite simply the most advanced cheat code system ever developed, yet it's so easy to pick up and use.

    Features:

        * NEW! Preloaded with over 30,000 powerful cheat codes for the latest and greatest PS2 games. Blast your games wide open with infinite health and ammo, unlock characters, levels, vehicles and more.
        * NEW! So easy to update with new codes in a variety of ways. The only cheat code system that can be updated directly via a PS2 broadband internet connection, USB Flash Drive, CD-R, USB keyboard or standard PS2 game pad.

        * NEW! Enjoy MP3 music via your TV or music system using your PS2 – enjoy over 10 hours of music on just one CD-R (encoded at 128kbps).
        * NEW! Watch movies encoded in popular file formats on your PS2. One CD-R contains up to 3 hours .

,uggenabben,2005-02-06T10:07Z,"No, I do not think it will enable you to format the Flash disk... From what I have found elsewhere you need a specal Flash disk. 
As the Max Media Creator is not included (there is a Japanese one at www.cybergadget.co.jp/spcontents/MMcreator/) I do not think this is what you are looking for..."

,JeePeR,2005-04-16T00:51Z,how the hell do i make dis shit work? do i have to have a hd or fd or a regual cd/dvd?
,RazzFazz,2005-04-19T04:15Z,I burnt this File on a CD-R but my PS2 is not working..:(
,nisse28,2005-05-12T13:49Z,"I got this working, and I got some codes working to.

The thing is, first you have to burn it on a regular cd. Then put it in your ps2 and start it, you do have to have a chip in it :P. Since this is apparently a NTSC version you can only use codes with NTSC games. "
,Mikaeru,2005-06-27T15:24Z,"Do you mean with the codes on the disc? Because i'd assume those are for ntsc games, but if you add pal codes, it should work just fine. I'm gonna do that in a short while. I'll post here and tell you if it works."
,Mikaeru,2005-06-27T21:31Z,"THIS WORKS WITH EUROPEAN GAMES TOO!

You just need to enter codes for the european game. The ones already on the disc are for the ntsc(american) versions of the games."
,adibcanale,2005-07-19T04:16Z,"What i have to do to install it on my ps2?  i burn it on a dvd and  cd, but the message ""please insert a valid ps2 format disc"" appears in both of them when i put it on the play station.

Please if anyone can help me 

Cheers

i put in the cd and then when i out in a game cd action replay can,t read the disc 

i have tried this witch 10 games or so 

why does it not work"
,LEMONed nÃ¸va,2006-04-09T06:56Z,"I've also noticed that I cannot get it to work with any back-ups that I have.  I figure it goes screwy with needing to use Swap Magic CD and putting it in and then needing to use another Swap Magic for a DVD back-up. 

Otherwise without using Swap magic the second time, the DVD backup will just spin and then say wrong disk.  And with using Swap Magic, it either says wrong disk, or you get in and it freezes."
