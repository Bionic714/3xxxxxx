,dingerdude,2008-09-19T04:41Z,"Thanks for the seed, folks. 

I bought this album years ago and lost it. Great album. Obie Trice is an under appreciated artist. 

Nice to have it back. Rock on. 

And like they say, ""Seed, mofos, seed!"" 

Give back. Don't just take. It's the circle of life or something. *takes another hit off the bong*

Awww Hell, I dunno. This shits got me waxing philosophical an shit."
