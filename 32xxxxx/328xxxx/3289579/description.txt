STRAY CAT ROCK - SEX HUNTER (NORA-NEKO ROKKU: SEKKUSA HANTA), 1970
Dir. Yasuharu Hasebe

The third film in the STRAY CAT ROCK series, SEX HUNTER is another aggressive jolt of a motion picture. Directed by Yasuharu Hasebe, the film stars Meiko Kaji as a gang leader who gets into street fights with her fellow teenage gangstresses. Mixed in with this violent activity is an energetic rock-and-roll soundtrack that keeps the girls full of fire. Featuring the 1970s pop group The Golden Halfs, SEX HUNTER floods the screen with color and style, resulting in a work that greatly influenced the films of Quentin Tarantino.
