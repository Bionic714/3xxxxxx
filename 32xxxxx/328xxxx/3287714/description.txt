Lee Mi Yeon (Addicted, Love Bakery) won the coveted Best Actress award 
at the 21st Annual Chongryong (Blue Dragon) Awards for her performance 
in the sensitive drama Pisces. Ae-Ryean (Lee Mi Yeon) is a lonely young 
woman who runs a small video store called "Sad Movie." A typical Pisces, Ae-Ryean loves French films and is innately attuned to the 
people surrounding her - and yet she still remains alone. One day she 
meets a new customer, a young musician named Dong-Suk (Choi Woo Je), 
who shares her passion for French film. Ae-Ryean is immediately smitten, 
but her love is tragically one-sided. Dong-Suk tries his hardest to spurn 
her, but she cannot let go, and as time passes, her deepening love begins
to consume her...


A sensitive and touching film about the pain and heartbreak of one-sided 
love, Pisces is an acting triumph for Lee Mi Yeon, and a sad valentine for 
cinema lovers everywhere.<p>
