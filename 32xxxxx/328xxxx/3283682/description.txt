A collection of Trees and plant life. As well as tree maps we have included bark, bushes, grasses, 
leaves, shrubs and stumps which have been photographed over a 1 year period allowing us to divide the 
trees into the categories of the 4 seasons plus an evergreen/tropical section giving the user as many 
choices as possible for all their scenes. 

As you can see from the examples on the left all of trees have been painted out of their original 
backgrounds by hand giving each one a perfect alpha map. This allows the tree maps to be inserted 
into any 3d scene by applying the tree map to a single polygon or they can be dropped onto a new 
layer in any 2d scene (in photoshop for example)
