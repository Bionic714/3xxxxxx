Well, i screwed up the DVD3 release. It was actually DVD4.
So even if this one is the real DVD3, i name it DVD4.
Make any sense?
In short, if you got my DVD3 release, get this one too...
Just rename the discs... :P

On this release, i have taken away some audiotracks to see if there was any improvement in the video.
So all my German, Italian and Spanish friends: 
I'm sorry, but you have to listen to the original 5.1 soundtrack instead of the 2ch dubbed. 
And to the french:
I don't care about you, you frog-eating freaks! Merde! ;-)

The dubbed soundtracks was 256Mb each, so there was about 1 Gb less to compress. The title still has the same compression as before(49%). and there was only 13Mb audio in the extras, so i didn't touch that. So the compression of the video is not as high as before.

Please do tell if you see any difference!

Sorry for the mixup between DVD3 and DVD4.

If you like it, seed it!
