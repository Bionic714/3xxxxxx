Hvilket format PAL/NTSC. Hvilke subs. Hvilken audio. Så skal jeg nok deltage, hvis det har de rigtige kriterier"

I'll guess since the uploader is danish, I'm certain it's a NORDIC PAL.."

,iipi,2005-03-18T21:54Z,"Yeah, especially for us who don't have too much hard disk space -and bandwith isn't exactly cheap either- it would be nice to know whether there are subs or not.. my hubbie wants his Fin subs in every movie, so I waste hours and my bandwith downloading stuff that isn't worth burning (for us). 
Thankfully Vegah clarified the subs -issue. Thanks!
:hooray:"
