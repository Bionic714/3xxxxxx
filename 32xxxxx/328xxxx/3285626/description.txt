 kampaii! prost! cheers! its been almost 2 years since out last adventure,
 seeing how things are quite different now with the gc scene, we figured
 why not have some more fun!

 We were all so drunk at a bloch's house and seeing this Donkey Kong thing,
 we were like yay yay! So our friend download it, but then after a few 
 hours waiting for the download... (dialup sux *_* ) we were all sober and
 just say fuck it, left home. Come back the next day it was like 90 percent
 done and finally done after 2 hours and we got drunk and play and have fun!
 But man, we could've done this earlier rather than wait, we didn't expect
 this from RARE, especialy when alot of new groups out there that has no
 knowledge, just rips original and release, we didn't expect an oldie group
 like Rare to do this, i guess this goes to show that Rare doesn't have the
 right stuff and uses the same shit like other groups do and now since they
 have like No idea if this will work fine or not, they just do unstripped
 releases now? Shame, thats how we would feel if we used those shitty
 public wiping tools avalible to the public no?  Over 750 megs of garbage
 found in this game! so we are like, fuck this, strip it all with the right
 stuff (Our coder like knows it too so does like hundreds out there scared
 to do it so Nintendo will find them and fire them!)  We know its a day old
 , we know its lame to a few sceners, but ask yourselve this, you guys 
 wouldn't know a proper when you see one, why even that Cobra nfo says
 garbage is not needed, We think even Nintendo UK said the same thing once a 
 long ass time ago especially when its gets decrypted and turns to 1 percent
 compression, but oh well. Doesn't work with GCSIM (sad *_*) but it works fine
 with Viper now, choose video mode (Real UK Bums choose 50!) and play!
 You can scan , you can look on how the GC lens reads at the edge of the disc
 (Sounds like padding with FST fixer no?), We played this for hours ( And used
 something sexy to us all..)! Just to show you that garbage isn't needed :/
 we hope some people will learn but we doubt it, especially since they can't 
 code for shit on a good stripping tool, Wipe seems to work also btw... Love 
 them memorex minis!

 since this game is nonsense party fun, PROST crew recommends you enjoy it
 with:

 PROST-CREW'S PROPERED Rum n Coke!
 
  5.0 oz. of Cola (Pepsi for you wimps!)
  2.0 oz of Light Rum (Hard Rum for men!)
  Supplment ingredient, a Prostitute at Suffix! 

  Shaken not stirred! Or whatever, its all good with babes n friends!


  enjoy and watch for more 10mbit rippers!
