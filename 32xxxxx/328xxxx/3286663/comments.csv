,Kovski,2005-02-07T20:55Z,"""This is of course the talkie version""

What do you menan by that? Are there other versions to or something? 

Hope someone seed soon :D"
,AssMaster,2005-02-07T22:54Z,"Well, DOTT (and some other Lucas Arts' games came in a CD-ROM (talkie version with voices), and a much smaller diskette version without the voices.
It should be lots of people seeding right now, so maybe the tracker is offline again. Wait and see.."
,Masq,2005-02-07T23:31Z,"How do you get the speak working?
When I start the game, there are no sounds! :o/"
,AssMaster,2005-02-07T23:52Z,"Use ScummVM so should everything work out fine, including sound."
,Gujuunit,2005-02-25T00:03Z,Thank You For this fine release.
,dj.unkown,2005-07-26T17:51Z,"one little question.

there are soundtracks in mp3 inside this archive,
placed in a OST map.

the game though, uses some kind of midi sound.

how can I use the mp3s in the game?
the same thing for Sam'n'Max"
,AssMaster,2005-08-06T22:30Z,"The OST is only included for musical entertainment reasons :P The games uses midi, so you can't change it to mp3. Same thing goes for all old LucasArts games except the ones that actually had audio tracks on cd (like Monkey Island 2 CD-ROM version I believe)."
,Rotormaskin,2006-04-07T18:23Z,"This is said to be ""the talkie version"". A supposed that meant the famous CD version from 1993 of Day of the tentacle, but this is the older version ""Maniac mansion"" from 1987 with it's simple graphic only interesting for computer game historians, and I cannot understand what's ""talkie"" about that version since the persons do not speak! 

Maybe I am really stupid to not understand it by myself, but I really think that it should have been explained from the beginning which version this is..."
,Optional,2006-05-01T19:25Z,"How the hell do you get this running? i have never ran a SCUMMVM emulated game before, so be gentle with your replies."
,leifer_n,2006-07-12T05:43Z,"Waaaitaminute! you mean this isn't DOTT, but Maniac Mansion?? that's kind of.... uh... misleading."
,Ivan Zenkov,2006-07-20T05:58Z,"THANK YOU!

Very good IDEA ""release each game individually including soundtrack and cd covers."""
,winzentween,2006-09-22T20:10Z,thyis is manic mansion not day of tentacle!!!! dont bother
,spock_84,2006-10-23T06:26Z,"Well i havent downloaded this torrent, but I have the old Dott game on cd, and the Maniac Mansion is included in dott as a mini game you can play it on a computer in the dott game. Are you sure you havent opened the wrong .exe file?"
,NilssonSchmilsson,2008-02-14T07:23Z,"Thank you so much. I actually registered only to leave a comment telling you how awesome. Thanks for packing both games, you're the best!"
,i_got_you69,2008-10-19T13:58Z,thanks for this man i really wanted the talkie version for this:D btw do you have any other talkie vers of old lucas arts games??
