Well, time for another little retro gamepack. I'm aware that DOTT can be downloaded in bigger torrents here on Pirate Bay, but I thought it would be a good idea to release each game individually including soundtrack and cd covers.

This is of course the talkie version :) Just unpack and run in preferably in ScummVM or DOSBox.
