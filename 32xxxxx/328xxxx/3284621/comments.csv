,Pippin,2005-02-03T20:45Z,"orione, I dont think you will be disappointed with Welles as Falstaff....And that last scene of final rejection is his best scene ever, I think. Will look for that book you mention - Falstaff is a very funny character! But i hope he doesnt make too many apologies for Hal....

Abrix: The audio is english - all i meant was that Shakespeare english can be hard to follow, if youre untrained in it. Dubbing films into foreign languages is a crime, or would be in this case - Welles' voice is always half the show. "
,azazelo,2005-02-03T22:23Z,"pippin, no words are enough to thank you for these quality films.
you really should join DV, it is the (other) place for ppl like you and orione."
,Pippin,2005-02-03T22:47Z,"Hi azazelo, Glad u enjoy them! Im already at DV, but i think it got to be a little less interesting site after the MPAA-crackdown. Theres still plenty of good stuff there, of course. But most of these Welles films couldnt go up there - thankfully everything goes in Scandinavia (americans have no clue what ""liberal"" really means!)."
