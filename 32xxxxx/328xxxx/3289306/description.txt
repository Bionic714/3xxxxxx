Part of The History of Rock n Roll series, volume 9 - Punk, deftly combines historical footage of both the American and British scenes of the mid to late 1970s with contemporary interviews. At ground zero is Detroit's Iggy Pop, who makes a terrific interview as a survivor of some of the hardest living the notorious, excessive movement witnessed. Includes many influential, fascinating, and colorful personalities including Patti Smith, The New York Dolls, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, Elvis Costello, The Clash, and many others. From CBGB to Malcolm McLaren's boutique Sex, the episode attempts to place an even-handed geographical spin on punk's simultaneous emergence on both sides of the pond.
