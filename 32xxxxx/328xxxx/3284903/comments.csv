,Equneko,2005-02-04T13:45Z,"The reason for the slow speed is due to crap ISP. I WILL however seed until at least 150%, no matter how long it will take."
,Equneko,2005-02-04T20:58Z,"Woah, good question! :o I have no idea why they're 0 bytes.. I'll put up a second torrent with them later next week."
,oberon77,2005-02-08T17:06Z,We Need a seeder!! Stuck at 97%
,Equneko,2005-02-08T18:40Z,I'm on it.
,oberon77,2005-02-10T06:10Z,"Seriøst! Jeg mangler 2 forbanna prosent? Hva slags røten ISP har du? Jeg skal seede dette en god stund, så gi meg de 2 prosenta så kan jeg overta. klarer tross alt 46 KB ut i sec."
,oberon77,2005-02-10T06:11Z,Crying... :'(
,Equneko,2005-02-12T00:36Z,"I'm sorry about this, but i've made big changes to the package. Now it contains some more games, lots of sounds and music has been compressed to ogg, and soundtracks for more or less all games has been added. I will try to put up a new torrent some time next week. Then i'll be on a 100mbit connection. Due to the changes i can not and will not try to seed this torrent. Wait until next week, you'll get your Lucasarts fix then ;)"
