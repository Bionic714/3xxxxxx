,fiende,2005-02-03T03:08Z,najs
,frawddaed,2005-02-03T07:54Z,"Det är lugnt! =)

Om det är nån som har den eminenta March of the pigs videon att dela med sig så får han gärna göra det! 

Jag saknar den! ;)"
,frawddaed,2005-02-03T14:30Z,"det är bara att hoppas!

Men en ""snar"" framtid kan man tolka hursomhelst när det gäller Trent tyvärr. =)"
,oxymoron69,2005-02-04T16:36Z,"t must have been released at some point, because i saw this when i was in high school...
anyway, thanks for this file. 

but... to anyone who is expecting dvd/even vhs quality is going to be disappointed. 
the file is watchable, but the best that we can expect lacking proper source material to rip. 
cheers!"
,frawddaed,2005-02-04T18:19Z,"you're welcome! =)

It never got an official release - but Reznor gave away ""marked"" copies to a selected few. 

The owner of the version you saw in highschool must
have been one of those, or someone who snatched a vhscopy of it on the street.  ;)

Well well - doesnt matter anyway. Its here now, and i cant do much about the quality. (I wish i could though.)"
,blackgrass,2005-03-10T22:03Z,"I think the video dress particularly good in this quality.
I´d definitly buy it, let´s hope they release it officialy.

,Werm,2005-04-13T19:18Z,"I got a VHS copy of this from an underground record store in Cleveland a few years back. My copy is better quality than this, but still not what I would consider 'good'.  

If I get it transferred I'll post... Dont wait up :)

This vid is awesome if you're just into 'extreme' films and not necessarilly NiN, btw.
"
,frawddaed,2005-04-15T17:24Z,sounds great! Ill keep my eyes open. 
,Heidrich,2005-07-05T17:51Z,Tackar! :-)
,innernumb,2005-07-11T05:31Z,This is a treat for all your NIN fans (like me) out there. Not for the faint of heart either! 
,ruiner666,2006-11-20T18:24Z,I think video has been released officially in form of Laserdisc back in 90's. I saw it in dutch video store's catalog. It would be great if it would be available as better qualty LD rip
,runkill.com,2007-04-13T01:43Z,"The guy that encoded this should be shot before he does this again. I'm a big NIN fan, and a big music video fan. I have downloaded 1,128 music videos, 26 are nine inch nails. This has to be The Worst Quality I Have Ever Seen.  It looks worst than any cammmed SVCD. 

To top it off they managed to fit nearly 300mB of this garbage in only 18 min of video. The only conceivable way of doing this I can think of would be for someone to do this would be to play the origanl dvd in a stand alone dvd player, run that to tv tuner from the 80s installed in a 150mhz PC, and the re-encoded 12 times for the hell of it.

Don't download this. It'll ruin the video seeing it in this form. The sound will drive you mad. This is a compilation of a few videos which are available here. The other versions of this video are even larger but they are at least dvd qualit I would imagine. 

Could someone please make an avi dvd-rip at say around 40-120mB. "
,runkill.com,2007-04-13T01:47Z,"I appreciate the upload though, it was just not what I was expecting for the size"
,Kevinb1577,2007-04-15T15:59Z,"^^ it was only released on VHS until a few years ago

before this was uploaded"
,runkill.com,2007-06-01T06:37Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3586323/Nine_Inch_Nails_-_Broken_High-Quality_DVD, better"
,CobyJames,2008-08-18T03:13Z,"This video is not the broken video.  it was part of a two vhs set from 1996 called CLOSURE which i have. it came packaged in a box set called the
BLACK BOX which contained the tapes, guitar tab, a piece of a shirt from a live show. a limited edition t shirt as well as bonus cd material. to get the REAL videos email me "
,CobyJames,2008-08-18T03:14Z,as for this dipshits comments on a non commercial release. you are full of shit. i bought this in 10th grade. they made copies. just they were pulled from the shelves 13 months after manufacture. look it up and dont believe everything you read. most of you were in diapers when this came out.
,CobyJames,2008-08-18T03:15Z,KEVIN a few years ago? again i bought this at least 12 years ago. two tapes. a cd. a t shirt. a tap and some music sheets. 
,nympholept,2009-02-17T20:50Z,"runkill - Thanks for letting us know that the new ""leaked"" DVD is better is that the decade-old VHS copy.

CobyJames - You're full of shit.
""they were pulled from the shelves 13 months after manufacture.""
Hilarious shit.

The Broken movie has never had a commercial release.  They never tried to release it in 1993, and it was never banned.
Look it up yourself:
