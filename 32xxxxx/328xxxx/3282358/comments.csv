,tsippadippa,2005-04-10T21:46Z,"This was just as sick and great as I anticipated. The Japanese have a way of showing the violence in such a realistic and discusting way that it's just fantastic. 
None of that hollywood, ""violence is funny"", crap..."
,Ramon,2005-04-11T07:26Z,"the sad thing about this movie is that it have come to that some people just watch and ""like"" this movie cuz its soooo different, and so non-hollyw00d. I were kinda one of them for some years ago, when i had watched this movie,..cause the truth is; This movie aint great, just twisted and sick without a meaning, with no feeling for class and art.

 but the asians are still kings on the Hongkong Action (DUH) and the horror front."
,retro,2005-05-08T22:34Z,"""no feeling for class and art""

i don't agree"
,Schorlivs,2005-05-19T00:23Z,"Tittade på denna i kväll och kan knappast rekomendera den, i varje fall inte till de som har svårt för jobbiga våldsscener. Tacka vet jag Lone Wolf, där slipper man i varje fall avskurna bröstvårtor... Tack för seedningen i hur som helst."

its about sadism and masochism and the storyline is unique, not for everyone an aquired taste, but if you didnt get the storyline you are a moron, its complex i know but get a brain"
,killer21165,2006-06-11T18:23Z,probably the most violent film ever made
,mogura,2006-07-04T02:13Z,The fully uncensored version is 129 mins. This appears to be 124. If this information is correct it would be 4 mins more than the UK-verison at 120. Is the torture scene involving the nipple ripping of the Chinese prostitute included in this edition? I was so disappointed when they left that scene out in the UK version.
,nytemare909,2006-12-04T00:14Z,Så jävla grym film =P haha.. =P
