Gspot:
 DivX 3 Low-Motion, 1316 kb/s bitrate
 This is a valid AVI file.
The filesize is 700 MB (or 717,604 KB or 734,826,496 bytes). 
 Of that, roughly 652 MB (93%) is video data; the remaining 48.4 MB ( 7%) is audio.
 The file's length is consistent with information embedded within the file, so it's fairly safe to assume that this file is complete - i.e. the file has not been truncated or otherwise damaged.
