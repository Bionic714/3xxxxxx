,watwegsw,2005-02-21T17:50Z,"bra serie, tyckte dock de verkligen grävde fram det sjukaste i sexavsnittet, för sådär är inte japan (har bott där i några år).

Gillade dir en grey :D"
,Kaeru,2005-02-23T02:39Z,"Som vanligt en FET release från Toba
Give this guy a medal or something

Domou Arigatou"
,hakubaku,2005-03-02T20:20Z,"Yes, hade bara ett avsnitt när Dir en grey var med.... älskar den jrock/visual kei gruppen btw...

Domo!"
,Ran4,2005-03-03T15:59Z,"""English Audio""

och jag som ville se en engelsktextad Dir en Grey-intervju.. suck. nåja."
,botterli,2005-04-02T15:54Z,"Wow, this looks sweet! /me oves japanese pop culture :)
Thanks a lot!"
,anothe1,2005-06-10T01:49Z,"this guy doesnt ask any good questions. if you are a good fan of anime for example he will just annoy you. 

I mean he talks to Oshii and he doesnt mention the word philosophy once! Obviously he doesn't think it plays a big part in Ghost in the Shell or any of his movies.

Also his jokes are annoying! He compliments Miazaki on his gingercake? And opens with the worst question possible, showing he didnt do enough research..

This series is good for the footage and at least some form of interview with the who's who of japan."
,masatoshi,2005-06-18T11:53Z,good job! again...like always!
,Ninja_Gundam,2005-06-30T09:16Z,Awesome i never see that things! :) Wow! Arigatouuu keep it as long as u can !

(I already know about ""adam and joe go tokyo"")"
,Ran4,2006-04-29T18:24Z,"Toba - My current ratio is 14.201, 24GB uploaded... xD
And that's just since my last reformat. I think i've uploaded about 35GB totally in last 12 months."
[V],tixan,2006-06-06T23:22Z,reseed please? =(
,Ran4,2006-06-12T22:59Z,"tixan - God damnit! how the fuck could you ask for a reseed, when there's almost always been at least 3 seeders on the torrent? And never EVER without a seeder for a day."
,d_dog666,2006-10-12T23:35Z,Thanks for this excellent program. Is anyone recording the current series?
,stonie104,2007-01-04T19:25Z,"anyone know were i can get 3x3 eyes? its an old manga series, cant find it anywhere

cheers"
,fatcannon,2007-01-08T21:51Z,What the fuck has this to do with seven swords
,sumthingsoft,2007-04-10T22:57Z,"Since these seem to be the only rips released for season one I say thanks for upping them. It's appreciated.

Haven't watched them all yet but is everyone experiencing the pauses mid-episode? (ep2 had quite a lot afair)"
,charmedbuttercup,2007-06-14T08:59Z,"A big thanks to Toba for posting this up and to those who are seeding this! :) I've been looking for Japanorama Season 1 all over the intarwebs and this is the only place I've found it.

@sumthingsoft:  I've watched everything, and yes, there were some pauses. Ep. 2 had a LOT, but several episodes only had one or two, I think."
