. ..: CAST / PLOT SUMMARY :.. .       

Many years ago a circus was coming to town with the 
train but as a storm made the bridge over the bay fall 
apart, the circus train went down in the water. 
The cargo that carried the clowns was never found and was
believed to have been sucked down beneath the sand. 
Legend has it that when it's raining you can hear  
carnival music from the bottomof the ocean.    
Guess what, there's a storm coming in...

Strange AR on this one. Shot on video and
cropped by the look of things. Still,
there's always room for one more insane clown movie.
