,andlabs,2007-06-25T01:59Z,"THIS IS THE MAC VERSION. IT DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS OR FRONTPAGE, BECAUSE THOSE ARE WINDOWS-ONLY PROGRAMS!!!! Access clones for Mac can be found at http://www.pure-mac.com/database.html. There are a handful of FrontPage alternatives: iWeb (part of Apple's iLife), RapidWeaver, and Sandvox are the most popular. Nvu and KompoZer are free ones, but slow on Intel Macs (they are more famous on Linux).

You need to have a torrent client. On Windows, you can use uTorrent or Azureus, among many. On Mac, Transmission is what I use. After installation, double-click on the torrent file and either the program will open and the download will begin or you will be asked to select the program yourself.

There are seeders at around 8:00 EDT at this very day."
,andlabs,2007-06-25T02:00Z,"whoblowsthere114: see my comment. This website does not download the program, but rather a torrent file. Right-click on the link and choose Save to Desktop (or whatever). Then follow my directions."
