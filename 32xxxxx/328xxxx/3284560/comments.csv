,rheglin,2007-02-01T07:40Z,Just in case klownkillah doesn't know how. I was curious how to burn this to dvd from a mac I'm new to burning dvds so if you could help me step by step I would really appreciate. I want to be able to play in a dvd player if at all possible. Thanks a ton 
,titestef,2007-04-04T20:14Z,"rheglin, if these files are .VOB, you can copy with Toast Titanium, very easily !  if you have questions about copy , this is my email adress :   titestefinou@hotmail.com   "
,klownkillah,2007-09-08T20:38Z,"as i posted on another one of my torrents: i no longer have these files on my computer :(

so please keep this torrent alive if you can.

p.s. if i have to re-rip this from the original dvd i will probably make it a DVDrip (avi) rather then a custom DVD (VOB) due to the size difference.

,Athenatius,2011-07-19T16:24Z,"Is there any subtitle? Like English... Although it's difficult to translate humor it would be nice for a Dutchman like me to see some subtitles.
I've been searching already but can not find anything...

I would be grateful.."
