I looked high and low for this show (in any format) on all sorts of different p2p networks, i found it once (on edonkey) and downloaded about 99.73% and then realized my 6 peers were also stuck at 99.73%  =(  needless to say that download never finished.....

so after almost a year of searching for this, i finally bought it... the quality is ok, not great, but ok.... it looks like the person i bought it from (on ebay) transcoded a VHS tape into a DVD (and even left fuzz/snow at the end of the show)... i can't complain since this show is nearly impossible to find!

Enjoy!

=============================

Region 1  (possibly more)
NTSC
PCM Audio
Source: Probably a VHS Tape

(this actually might be a Region Free DVD, you should be able to play it as long as you can play NTSC.... i ripped it using MacTheRipper which is supposed to remove Region Specific Coding from the TS_VIDEO folder - i just havent verified this, so i listed it as Region 1)

from IMDB:

Plot Summary for Freak (1998/I) (TV)
John Leguizamo's semi-falsified, one-man-standup performance as...himself. This is his autobiographical story, about his life growing up, and his journey to try and be accepted by his father. We see this story through a bizzare myriad of characters and situations, which include the eccentric Uncle Sanny, the "Fat Boy Called Bitch"; (John's little brother, Poochie), his mom, his evil grandmothers, and Lee Stratsberg, not to mention a brief appearance by Spike Lee as God Almighty.


==================================

also, i have a label design for this i will be posting later on today.  The cover design i made is for a triple pack which includes John Leguizamo's "Sexaholix", "Mambo Mouth", and "Spic-o-rama" - so i am not sure if people would want that without the other dvd's (which i could start sharing within a day or two)... post comments if you want the other dvd's...
