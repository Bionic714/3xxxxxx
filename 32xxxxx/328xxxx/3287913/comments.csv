,Harem_B,2005-03-02T22:20Z,"teske: What Graphiccard are you using? I had the same problem with my NVidia GF 2MX.

För övrigt är detta en taskig rip utan musik. Även ljudet lägger av efter ett tag."

[T],FaeGiN,2008-06-14T16:50Z,"Why do such smart assed pricks write things like 'this is the demo...avoid it'???
that idiot obviously didn't actually download it and yet he thinks he is in a position to warn people about what he has made up himself...tosser!
THIS IS THE RIP of the full game.
Ripped out of the game are the movies and the music.
Apart from that this is a fully working rip and the game is fine.
When it is extracted it becomes between 300-400Mb anyway..has that tosser never heard of compression?
It is a winrar self extracting file and contains this
version of the game:
WWE.RAW-class.rip-prtti.ace
which has the NFO document here - 
http://r-a-pidshare.c-o-m/files/122393905/CLASS.NFO

Byee!"
[T],FaeGiN,2008-06-14T16:51Z,"obviously the link for the NFO document I give above...you need to remove the - characters from it!
Oh and it isn't some crap RS link for points, it is only a 2kb file, I just upped it so fok can see what the game is..."
