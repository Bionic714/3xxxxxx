,hi-tech,2005-01-27T11:56Z,"Well, personally I think the IMDb rating matches my taste in most cases - ofcourse there's exceptions.
We all got our own taste, and it would be meeningless to discuss it, but the beauty about the IMDb rating is that it shows an weighted average. Therefore both the opinion of people who like it and don't like it will be expressed in the score. Also, people who are interested in the genre, will more likely vote than those not into it. So only 1.3 out of 10 doesn't sounds promising.
Your statement about most people being idiots, seems a little ironic... time to come out of you glass bouble? -But it was still a fun metaphor."
