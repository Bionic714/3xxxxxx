,jman2004,2006-04-23T04:50Z,"I started downloading this and previewed some of the files.  Most of the files are chopped samplers.  I mean, Dutchmassive ""BusstopbuildingBlock"" has 5 differnt songs melded into it.  Is this intentional, or must I wait until the entire torrent loads.  If it's intentional, why on earth would anyone want to download, much less seed it??"
