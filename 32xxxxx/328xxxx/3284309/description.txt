Flight 77

    * There is no evidence that the aircraft that hit the Pentagon was Flight 77.

    * There Pentagon's security cameras offer evidence that a Global Hawk was shattered by a missile. The missile may have been launched automatically from a defense system around the Pentagon.


The World Trade Center Towers

    * Explosives were placed in both towers before the attack to cause the towers to disintegrate into dust.

    * Explosives may have been detonated via radio by a computer in Building 7.


Building 7

    * It was a 47 story, steel-framed building that disintegrated at 5:30 PM, also from explosives.

    * The 23rd floor was the Mayor’s "Emergency Command Center," which had its own air supply. This appears to be the command center for the attack on the towers.
