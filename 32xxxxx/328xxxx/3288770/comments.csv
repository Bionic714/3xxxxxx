,negativeions,2005-05-09T09:23Z,I can't believe how many times I've witnessed within my bt client people completing the download and then disappearing like 10 seconds later... Maybe we should start taking down the IPs of leechers and report them to tpb and have them ban you permanently from tpb trackers...

,LezDawson,2008-09-22T10:06Z,"Works great, and it doesn't appear to be region protected either - I played it on a DVD player set for region 2 only (associated with the PAL colour system), and it played fine, and my TV displayed it perfectly.

So, as long as you have either an NTSC TV, or an 'NTSC-compatible' TV (which most PAL TVs are these days) you will have no problems with this disc, whichever region you are in."
,LezDawson,2008-09-22T10:08Z,"Oh yeah, forgot to mention - as mentioned in the description, the menus and extras have been stripped.  As soon as you start playing the disc, the movie itself will start.  You'll need to hit the subtitle button on your remote."
