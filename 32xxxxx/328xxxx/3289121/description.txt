Hell Wants Him. Heaven Won’t Take Him. Earth Needs Him. You Control Him. To protect the world, John Constantine will have to walk the fine line between Demons and angels. He investigates a dark world that exists just beneath the landscape of contemporary Los Angeles and attempts to seek out and destroy pure evil – before peace on earth is destroyed forever.
