,PawnSacrifice,2009-11-16T10:29Z,"Shows 1 seeder! 

If you ALWAYS seed to at least a ratio of 1:1 then there should always be 100% availability on all files!

Is that so hard to do???"
,PawnSacrifice,2009-11-16T10:29Z,I meant 1 leecher...0 seeders!
,Rimmer7,2010-01-09T17:51Z,I'm at 99.9% with 2 pieces left. If you could seed for just a minute I can keep seeding for quite a while.
