,Achtung_Baby,2005-02-12T06:40Z,"No p, please inform all your freinds that are into M.Moore and  his movies about this torrent.  This film is a little bit more radical then Moores movies, without being a christian right-wing job like ""the great deception"" or stuff like that. Please help seed! :D"
,morgmorg,2005-02-12T15:35Z,"Thanks for this one! :D

But I'm wondering two things:
1. Is it supposed to be so small in size? (1.8gb for a dvd)
2. Do you have The Great Deception as well?

Thanks again! :)"
,Achtung_Baby,2005-02-12T20:04Z,"Yes it is complete. I write here tomorrow when I have done ""deception""  sry drunk engl... :D "
