Charlie MacKenzie is a dedicated San Francisco coffeehouse poet, whose poems revolve around his numerous failed relationships. Every one that ends on his doing because of some weird, inexcusable paranoia. His best friend Tony and mother May can only criticize him for his wrong-doings. But Charlie believes he very well may have found the perfect woman in Harriet, a meat butcher with a heart of gold. But Charlie begins suspecting something about Harriet that may not be so perfect.
