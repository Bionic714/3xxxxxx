,FightRIAA,2005-01-22T03:26Z,plz drop the spanish language torrents. 
,Tahlith,2005-01-22T03:57Z,"and why should the spanish torrents be dropped? We have just as much of a right to upload spanish as you upload english and swedish, wouldn't you agree? 

Keep the spanish torrents coming - love them ^^"
,Capt.Snowman,2005-01-22T04:55Z,pctorrent = CRAP
,GreyHades,2005-01-22T05:26Z,I do agree on the site being a crap but yes I AGREE as for spanish torrents but not 100% ie english/spanish language or subs are mostly welcome in any part of the world... no need to keet them out
,vassle,2005-01-22T12:53Z,keep the spanish stuff coming! It's an excellent way to practice your spanish-language skills. And far cheaper than a ticket to spain.
,FightRIAA,2005-01-22T14:50Z,keep them the fuck OUT! there are tons of spanish torrent sites...go and use them! DOnt clutter up EVERY other torrent site with these pathetic dubbed movie rips! Learn english...or piss off!
