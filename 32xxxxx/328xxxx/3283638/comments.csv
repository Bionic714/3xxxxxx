And i vote gremlins. I have em' already, but i just love them so fucking much. :)"
,hi-tech,2005-02-02T01:19Z,"No, I have to say that Shredder isn't my favorite movie :) It starts out okay, but then it goes down hill the rest of the time, if I remember correct..... IMHO.
I would also have to say Gremlins - it's a classic."
