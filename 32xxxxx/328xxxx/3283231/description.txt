<i>Summary:</i><p>

A lonely man...
Two beautiful women...
And an unpredictable love affair...<p>

In the dreary and rigid city of Seoul, there lives a guy in the dumps. His name is Gyung-soo and heÂ´s an actor who is fairly well-known on stage. He trusted a director he knew well and acted in his movie, but it flopped. He persistently insisted on receiving his actors fee, but all he got was a mere grands worth. He also misses out on his chance to act in the next role he promised to do. The future looks cloudy for him.<p>
