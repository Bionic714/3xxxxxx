Arthur (aka Wart) is a young boy who aspires to be a knight's squire. 
On a hunting trip he falls in on Merlin, a powerful but amnesiac 
wizard who has plans for Wart beyond mere squiredom. He starts by 
trying to give Wart an education (whatever that is), believing that 
once one has an education, one can go anywhere. Needless to say, 
it doesn't quite work out that way.


This is one for all you old school movie fans, I used to love
watching this movie when I was growing up.
