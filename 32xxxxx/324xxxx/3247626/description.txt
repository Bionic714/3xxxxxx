Due to space constraints and rising rental costs, an admirer of 
Wong Fei Hung convinces him to relocate his kung fu school and 
clinic next to what turns out to be a brothel. While trying to 
shield his followers from immorality, Wong finds himself at odds 
with a new, corrupt police chief who is secretly helping a local 
group of monks to kidnap young women and sell them as slaves in 
Southern Asia. Wong finds himself investigating their temple after 
two martial arts masters, Tin Yin-er and her father discover the 
monks intentions. Despite an attempt to frame Wong for attacking 
the monks without just cause and poisoning him which leads to a 
temporary loss of hearing, Wong tries to stop the police chief 
who also part of the Boxer Rebellion from assassinating a foreign 
official.
