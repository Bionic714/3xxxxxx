,tospace,2010-05-01T19:31Z,"This torrent started off my chemical collection a few years ago.  Since then I have probably listened these albums for 1000's of hours of my life and I am now redownloading most of these in FLAC.  This torrent has all the studio albums exept we are the night, push the button, and brotherhood and it has a couple Compilations/singles.  Most of these are somewhat exepteble 192 mp3 quality but some important ones arn't. 

Come With Us - is a old version from 2000 I think.  I noticed a big differince after downloading the flac version from 2002.

Exit Planet Dust - Is only 128 kbps and one song is actually 112.  very annoying bitrate for such a great album.

Surrender - is missing one song, ""The sunshine underground"". Its not really my fav album but The sunshine underground is good

This is a good collection with most of the albums you need to start off but If you really want high quility perfect rips that are the same as the cd's' I would get as many of them in flac as you can or at least, mp3 320kbps.  thanks for uploading this amazing music though,  I think I listen to the chemical brother ever day still... allot...

Have fun and doesn't listen too much or your brain will melt :)"
