OK here's some Black Flag as promised, the Berlin show is the only one of low quality, i cleaned it up as much as i could without losing colour but its a pro shot show with good sound and the rest is good quality. The Target video has different dates at the bottom thats because i edited it from the best copies i had, any enjoy!
