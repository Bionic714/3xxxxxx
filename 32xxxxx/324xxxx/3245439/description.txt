  GAME INFORMATION:
 -------------------
 
  In The Sims 2, you direct your Sims over a lifetime and mix their genes
  from one generation to the next. You set your Sims' goals in life; fame,
  fortune, family, romance or knowledge. Give them a long, successful
  existence or leave their lives in shambles. Take them to extremes, from
  getting busted to seeing a ghost, from marrying an alien to writing a great
  novel. Unleash your creativity with the all-new Create-A-Sim, new building
  options, and the new in-game movie camera. Get ready to mix their genes,
  fulfill their dreams, and push them to extremes. What do you want to do
  with your Sims' lives?
 
 
  GAME FEATURES:

  * Mix Genes: Your Sims have DNA and inherit physical and personality
    traits. Take your Sims through an infinite number of generations as you
    evolve their family tree. 
 
  * Fulfill Dreams: Your Sims now have purpose in life. Do they aspire to a
    life of fame, fortune, family, knowledge, or romance? It's up to you to
    decide if they will be a lover or a loser, a prince or a pauper, a fool
    or a mastermind, and many other choices. Give them what they want and
    they'll lead a long, successful existence; indulge their fears and risk
    ruining their lives. It's all in your hands.    
 
  * Push The Extremes: Will your Sims be left at the altar and need a shrink,
    or inherit a fortune and become filthy rich? Witness the big moments that
    make every Sim's life uniquely memorable.

    packed with a vast selection of facial features, hairstyles, and outfits.

    record every detail as your very own Sims sitcom unfolds.
