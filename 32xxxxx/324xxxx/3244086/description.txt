This is a full rip of Xara WebStyle 4.0.

It's a RIP of the program files, installed from a ISO file, and i installed extra templates.

Since it is just program files, you need registry patches, which are included.
It's tested and working, with over 1000 templates. 

If you have any problems, post a comment here, or email me at: john@magic-html.com with what is happening, i will see if i can fix it.
