I can´t use any of the ""new"" templates if i don´t buy them first.

Do i need to make some other changes or what??"

I know a lot of people do not trust .exe files, these are self extracting archives, I ALWAYS open these with Winrar, just to be safe anyway.
Or give me a day or two and I will upload the torrent."

,iceman45,2006-05-07T05:33Z,Does this really have new templates or not? And the other one on piratebay is 170+ megs. How can this have extra templates if its missing 150 megs compared to the other Xara torrent on piratebay?
,binomial,2006-05-20T23:23Z,"So has anyone found any of the templates for this software. It looks like a pretty good package, but you don't get much to work with, unless you have the templates. I got this software to work simply by dl the trial version and then getting a trial to retail crack.

Like everyone else that has commented, I did not get this package to install.

If you have templates, please share them!! Thanks guys.

And BTW, there are only the free basic templates you can't to jack with in this package."
