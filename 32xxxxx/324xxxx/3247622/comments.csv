,AELoN,2004-10-16T16:49Z,fan dom här Jet Li filmerna är ju helt jävla otroliga..
,Aleh,2005-01-23T20:57Z,tjeena folket... var kan jag hitta black mask 2?
,sevandersson,2005-02-14T22:24Z,Vilken jävla skit film. Det sämsta Jet Li gjort...
,Hardtrance,2005-03-31T09:20Z,"Probably the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The rip itself is ok, but the rest.. The only good thing is the pretty girl he is running around with. "
,eurorepublik,2005-07-27T07:43Z,"Im sorry this movie itself is awesome, but the Dubbing is piss poor, it cuts in and out, and the video cuts out two or three times in the movie.

As well they cut out the orginal music which was awesome, and replaced it with rap, what in the fuck?

Movie - 8/10
Video - 6/10
Audio - 2/10"

,jacobsurchy,2007-03-31T23:44Z,Åssen seeder man?
,tbteherror,2007-11-17T06:23Z,I have to say...this is the worst dub(voice over audio) ever. Micheal sounds like fucking microsoft sam... do not dl WASTE of time!
,thor228,2008-02-04T23:37Z,"i fucking hate this stupid american remake with ""michael"" instead of the rather brilliant original chinese version with jet li being called ""tsui chik"""
,tekno1er,2008-03-16T23:52Z,care to elaborate on what the fuck it is your rambling about?
,blackxino,2008-07-29T22:06Z,"what da hell is this!?
the rip is good.
but what da hell is the dubbing!?
I swear if this is the official dubbing, I won't bother watching this, because its so bad, the voice doesn't even suit him, I can't hear any music.

I do appreciate the people that did the dubbing, but this dub isn't for me:/"
,himrchp,2010-08-14T06:00Z,"you'd think the dub was bad but its not, i love this movie cuz its so cheezy.  Black mask part 2, while it doesn't have jet li in it was one of my all time favorites.  i found it on vhs at the dollar store.  Someone find black mask part 2 =D"
