,maini4ka,2008-11-28T13:42Z,"Thank you so much, tacky.
Korean Cinema is a fresh breeze.  No wonder Hollywood's been doing so many remakes of Korean movies recently.
This is the good side of sharing: as no Korean movie has ever been shown in theaters in my country, this is widening my horizons and well, I'm ripping nobody off :-)
Keep the good work!"
