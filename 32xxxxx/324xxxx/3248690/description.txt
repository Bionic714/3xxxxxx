JPGAvi creates a video (AVI) file from a series of (or individual) bitmap files. These can then be viewed as a single video file, similar to a photo slideshow or used to insert still frames into a video sequence. One of JPGAvi's main uses is to convert still pictures into an AVI file, so they can be used when editing a video sequence. The video file can contain the names of each bitmap, so if a web cam is used to take photographs every few seconds, it becomes very easy to find a specific frame. JPGAvi supports JPG, BMP, GIF ICO, PCX, TGA and TIF input. It can process entire directories and supports command line options as well. Additional features include identical frame detection, sorting of frames, customizable frame speed and more.
