Alter Bridge resurrected the music-making portion of Creed. After that band's 2004 dissolution, guitarist Mark Tremonti and drummer Scott Phillips tapped ousted bassist Brian Marshall for the new project. Ex-Mayfield Four frontman Myles Kennedy was soon on board as well. Alter Bridge made its Wind-Up debut in August 2004 with One Day Remains. Written largely by Tremonti, the record tried to lean more toward a hard rock/metal sound than the post-grunge grandstanding of his previous group. 



Härlig mainstream rock ala creed. Mp3 med 400 - 550 kbit/s. Jag är ny på det här, är det bara flac och ogg som gäller eller? Kommentera gärna!
