,lomega,2007-06-03T22:10Z,"I finally finished downloading this..  am very excited to use it.  

but HOW?!  

what kind of module do i open this with?  not working with combinator, nnxt , nn19, drRex...

nothing so far..  weird thing is, it doesnt even work when i use the ""create device by browsing patches'  option..


please someone enlighten me on how to use this!"

rfl files, also caled ReFills, is only for use with the music software called ""REASON"".. 

Not for anything els. If you just look for normalt mp3 loops and stuff, then google has it alle..

,e0,2008-02-17T04:15Z,"These are individual SAMPLES packaged in a refill, so you must browse the refill using the ""load samples"" function of the NN-19 or NN-XT samplers. It's a bit of a pain, but once you have your patches set up, the samples are pretty good."
