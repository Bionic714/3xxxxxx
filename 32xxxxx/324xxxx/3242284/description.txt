A wireless LAN (WLAN) is a data transmission
system designed to provide location-independent
network access between computing
devices by using radio waves rather than a
cable infrastructure. In the corporate enterprise,
wireless LANs are usually implemented
as the final link between the existing wired
network and a group of client computers, giving
these users wireless access to the full
resources and services of the corporate network
across a building or campus setting.
WLANs are on the verge of becoming a
mainstream connectivity solution for a broad
range of business customers. The wireless market
is expanding rapidly as businesses discover
the productivity benefits of going wire-free.
According to Frost and Sullivan, the wireless
LAN industry exceeded $300 million in 1998
and will grow to $1.6 billion in 2005. To date,
wireless LANs have been primarily implemented
in vertical applications such as manufacturing
facilities, warehouses, and retail
stores. The majority of future wireless LAN
growth is expected in healthcare facilities, educational
institutions, and corporate enterprise
office spaces. In the corporation, conference
rooms, public areas, and branch offices are
likely venues for WLANs.
