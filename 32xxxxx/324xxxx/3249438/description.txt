  ±    Joanna Eberhart, a wildly succesful president of a TV Network, after 
       a series of shocking events suffers a nervous breakdown and is moved 
       by her milquetoast of a husband, Walter, from Manhattan to the chic, 
       upper-class and very modern planned community of Stepford, 
       Connecticut. Once there, she makes good friends with the ascerbic 
       Bobbie Markowitz, a jewish writer who's also a recovering alcoholic. 
       Together they find out, much to their growing stupor and-then 
       horror, that all the housewives in town are strangely blissful, and 
       somehow... doomed. What is going on behind the closed doors of the 
       Stepford Men's Association and the Stepford Day Spa? Why is 
       everything perfect here? Will it be too late for Joanna and Bobbie 
       when they finally find out?                                          ±
