,black_bay,2006-07-08T19:03Z,"I'l seed for as long as i can when i get this, the .05 is a really important upgrade for me.

EVERY ONE WANTS THE LATEST THING, come on. I mean you guys are telling me that you have gone beyond the v4. series L2 or EQ or Comps. we really need the v5?

i spose it's great for other apps and such but we need a catalouge of old stuff kicking around.

just my thoughts, then we can get on and make some nice free independent music, more power to Pirate BAy!
