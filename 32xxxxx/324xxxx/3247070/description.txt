Scotty Smalls moves to a new neighborhood with his mom and stepdad, 
and wants to learn to play baseball. The neighborhood baseball guru 
Rodriquez takes Smalls under his wing, and soon he's part of the 
local baseball buddies. They fall into adventures involving baseball, 
treehouse sleep-ins, the desirous lifeguard at the local pool, 
the snooty rival ball team, and the travelling fair. Beyond the 
fence at the back of the sandlot menaces a legendary ball-eating 
dog called The Beast, and the kids inevitably must deal with him.


This is one for all you old school movie fans, I used to love
watching this movie when I was growing up.
