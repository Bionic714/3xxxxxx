,XweAponX,2007-03-17T19:55Z,"Even if you mount, udpate, and crack,
will not work with some laptops.

Port Royale 2 will install fine, and the splash screen will come up, but it will crash on menu screen.

According to Ascaron Entertainment, the manufacturer. they have not tested it with nor do they guarantee compatability with laptops."
,Jaakk0Po1ka,2007-09-04T16:12Z,how do i unrar this game? Im not a computer genius and i need help.

,Sefus,2007-11-07T05:19Z,"ok I think I've done everything right.

Mounted with Daemon Tools, Installed, Copied Crack, Moved it to the game's folder but I get a ""Disk Verification Error"" any way I try it :(

Any info on that?
I heard this game was pretty good."
,mich18,2008-01-04T11:42Z,"Dear people i have a question, when i mount the file, i get the autoplay and when i clik install, nothing happens....i tried several times, i also tried the Setup file on the disk, that also didn't respond, does anyone has any idea whats going on and hoe i can install and play this game? i also heard it is pretty good so im eager to play it! Thanks Regards"
,kevceltic,2008-01-17T20:15Z,"Works great for me, how I did it -

1. Have a copy of Daemon Tools
2. Unrar the File
3. Right click on Daemon Tools(should be in the tray), Mount Port Royale file just extracted.
4. Install
5. Have a copy of Magic Iso.
6. Open file just extracted with Magic Iso, find crack on the right hand side, left click on it, then right click and extract.
7. Open crack file just extracted, double click updater.
8. Go into crack file again, right click on pr2 file(next to the updater), copy.
9. Go into my computer, then whatever drive game is installed into, then Asceron Entertainment, port royale 2, right click and paste, click yes to overwrite.
10. Bobs your uncle."
,Silmeria,2008-02-15T15:54Z,"SEEDa, kom igen , ligger på 15-20 kb/s nu, lite väl segt eller vad tycker in, så snäla seeda  nu FÖR HELVETTE!!!"
,Wopatoolie,2008-02-15T21:26Z,"i know how to open these games and other quirks that come with them can be a pain but eventually all that gets worked out in something simple.  when i mount this to install it though,  the 'port royale 2' screen comes up and when i click on install nothing happens, thats as far as it will go. so now what......?"
,legin2,2008-03-08T19:09Z,Doesnt work for me.  Mount with Daemon Tools...autorun...nothing happens.  
,50man,2008-06-01T09:58Z,SEEDA:D PLZ
,CitationX525,2008-07-04T01:31Z,"kevceltic:

That does not work! If you copy the files, it won't work because the dumbass who made this torrent made all the files ""read only"" so you can't overwrite. Even if you try to un do the read only, it says theres an error and you cant do anything. "
,K4lib3r,2008-08-20T19:21Z,FIND CRACK HEARE ------> www.lemonparty.org
,gaz23,2008-09-17T04:31Z,anyone figured out how to get this working yet pls let me know. i cannot do anything because the files are read only
,baksuds,2008-11-30T12:28Z,"Try this!

1. Unrar the file
2. dubble-click on cd icon(or open it with nero)
3. Burn
4. Install the game
5. Run the updater located in the /Crack dir on the cd
6. Go into my computer, then whatever drive game is installed into, programs, Asceron Entertainment, port royale 2. Ex(E:\Programmer\Ascaron Entertainment\Port Royale 2
7. Copy pr2 file(next to the updater), located in the /Crack dir on the cd
8. Go into my computer, then whatever drive game is installed into, programs, Asceron Entertainment, port royale 2. Paste
9. Cut the pr2 file and paste it in the Ascaron Entertainment map

How it worked for me. Good luck"
,Arsepilami,2008-12-27T23:55Z,No use didn't work. Tried with 2 different computers but the game wont work. Have to try another torrent.
,kkhorev,2009-01-05T18:42Z,"Installed, but didn't work. My antivirus said there's a trojan trojan horse SHeur2.FGO so I blocked it. Don't know if it's a real troyan or a mistake that most antiviruses make, but since no one here mentioned having same problem, I won't risk it.

Vista, laptop, AVG antivirus"
,josefmaris,2009-01-24T16:49Z,"its trojans in it, don't download"
,josefmaris,2009-01-27T20:12Z,"i have a problem even installing the game. i mount the file in deamon and the autorun pops up but when i press install, it doesn't react. anyone have any clue? ive tried to download all kinds of different torrents but no one works. would be glad to get some help!"
,levis105,2009-02-28T20:51Z,0n1n3 you are stupid gay. all work
,lonelywurm,2009-04-16T02:07Z,"Thanks for this. Works great, installed first time on WinXP.

To unpack all of them (I'm guessing the Swedish comments adress this, aber ich nicht spreche Schwedisch/je ne parle pas suédois), just use WinRar and do this (in WinXP):

highlight all of the .r## files (.r00-r52, I think)
Right-click and select ""Extract to rld-prt"" ... and there's your image file.

It's easy enough after that to overcome the the read-only thing... just... like... copy the updater to your desktop. And voilà, working game!

Amuse-toi bien."
,libelle9,2009-04-26T02:17Z,"Seems to install fine, but Updater not working. Tells me a .dll is missing, which is clearly there. I'm on vista, and have had to do some hacking on old games to get them to work, sometimes the sound drivers are not compatible. That's all I can think of - I'm an amateur. "
,libelle9,2009-04-26T02:50Z,"RIGHT.


RUN THE UPDATE BEFORE CRACKING IT. 

That is all. "
,camicio,2009-09-23T19:43Z,"Works fine, just follow the instructions."
,spirit865,2010-04-24T00:56Z,"It works, but really depends on system. For me on windows 7 it does show any screen, just hangs in a process list. However runs perfectly fine on virtual machine with windows XP."
,iiiratep,2010-05-30T04:03Z,"I've exhausted myself trying to get this to run on Windows 7. I don't think it's possible. Sometimes it runs invisibly in the process list, while other times it blue screens the entire system. Ascaron is dead so there's no hope of a patch. So long PR2!"
,tpsnoopbot,2010-06-12T14:21Z,"No need to crack dude i installed and played the game without a crack...

1. Mount the the settlers: rise of an empire using daemon tools.
2. Install the game.
3. Update the official patch 1.7.1
4. Play the game

it's sooo easy to install. If that didnt work for u, ur PC needs an upgrade.

thank u for the nice game PQRs. =)"
,Nerd4ever,2011-03-23T05:15Z,"Installed it just fine, just update and use the crack, using windows 7 32 bit."
,neozelandes,2011-04-07T21:00Z,wtf a binary file?
,Dimmis80,2011-08-03T22:21Z,The game its working just fine.Thanks a lot @PQRS.:-)
,ncc46537,2011-09-07T01:02Z,"Windows 7, 32-bit system.
Runs fine.
Good upload, works well, though I don't entirely like the game.
But, that's why I download them before buying."
