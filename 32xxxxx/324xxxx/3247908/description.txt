	    		Cabelas Dangerous Hunts
Pursuing world-class big-game trophies through a variety of challenging terrain is one thing. 
Hunting those same animals when they (or other animals in the area) are hunting you is something else entirely.
 That's a lesson you'll learn when playing Cabela's Dangerous Hunts, which has more character development, more
 aggressive animals and more closed-in, confined and detailed surroundings than previous hunting titles. 
Players will be confronted with a series of hunting situations that will enhance their skills and help them
 develop a sense of identity with their on-screen hunter. Upon successful completion of the various challenges,
 chartered hunts and more challenges will become available. You'll earn money for your successful adventures 
along the way and will be able to use that money to buy a collection of hunting gear that would make any hunter
 envious. But the real stars of this game are the animals. They will engage you with more realistic and often 
aggressive behavior. You might encounter a mountain lion while hunting mule deer in the canyons of Wyoming, or
 be forced into a precarious position to get a good shot at a Kodiak brown bear. In addition to your primary
 weapon, you'll also have a pistol or a knife that can be drawn and used in self defense when an animal attacks.
 Rugged mountains, canyons and ravines, dense forests and rolling hills with water boundaries all will present
 unique and challenging obstacles to test your hunting skills. Choose the Quick Hunt, where you'll pick one 
animal, a region/season and your gear; the Action Zone, where you'll have waypoints to go through while hunting
 a variety of scripted animals; or the Career Mode (the primary game mode), where you'll find the challenges
 and charter hunts that allow you to advance to higher levels.

			INSTALL:
1. unrar
2. This RIP is a little harder, because it's not an ISO.
You need the application path in the registry for it to work correctly.
Start by opening Reg_Keys.key with NOTEPAD
Here is the 2 critical lines:
"Path1"="C:\DOWNLO~2\TDNGRH"
"Path"="C:\DOWNLO~2\TDNGRH\Program"

You must change "Path1"="[VALUE HERE]"
To the unzipped FOLDER
So, for example, if you unrared to c:
then the program path would be "C:Dangerous Hunts"

So, the correct way to set it up would be:
"Path1"="C:Dangerous Hunts"
"Path"="C:Dangerous Hunts\Program"

After you change the values, save Reg_Keys.key.
Then run, and click "YeS" when it ask's you if you want to enter the data into the registry.

3. Run Dangerous Hunts.inc or open bindngh.exe

		PLEASE NOTE:
	   The info in the RAR is WRONG!
    Please use this nfo file for installation!
		ENJOY
