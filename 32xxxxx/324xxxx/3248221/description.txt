Alright here is a rare MTV program on punks from 1985 called Punks And Poseurs A Journey Into The L.A. Underground, it features GBH and the Dickies live. This is another rare time MTV bothered to feature punk bands, although it does have the usual quota of morons inbetween the live footage, it makes up for it as there is plenty of live footage for a change mainly GBH so enjoy!

Punks And Poseurs A Journey Into The L.A. Underground-MTV 1985 SVCD 60 minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

Enjoy bandit999
