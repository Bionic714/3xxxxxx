Some might object that doing a one cd rip of this one with ac3 sound would compromise the quality
but I don't think that the quality suffers at all: it's a sci-fi movie and thus should by
experienced in surround sound. I haven't seen the other rips so I can't compare. Swedish subs
included.
My opinion about the film: Nice package, not much content. A week after I saw it I cant't really remember what it was about :-/
