Alright here is Green Day live at Woodstock in 1994, this is the full show, including the first 30 seconds where the sound is low and a bit screwed up, thats how it was when it was broadcast. This has been ripped from a transferred NTSC to PAL VHS tape so the quality of the picture isn't perfect but the sound is good, overall it's pretty good. I removed the flowery bars at the top and bottom as well. I also edited the talking out where they cut away and you can hardly notice the join. I have included 2 tracks that i taped when the BBC showed highlights, these are excellent quality, enjoy!

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
