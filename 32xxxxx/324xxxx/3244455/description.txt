A Qing general (Johnny Wang) deviously pits lay students of South
Shaolin Temple against North Shaolin in hopes that they destroy
each other. Initially outmatched by the superior skills of North
Shaolin and vowing to avenge their dead comrades, three Southern 
students each master a different style though elaborate training 
exercises.
