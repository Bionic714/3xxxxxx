,Pavlion,2005-04-16T20:13Z,"If you get a error message like ""The file is different from the servers"", then remove your file crack, and download Deamon-Tools or Alcohol 120 %, install it, and download and mount this file with the application:

http://landhell.fpp.pl/hst_aristocracy/index.php?PAGE=down&FILE=Battlefield%201942%20ISO.ISO&DIR=

This ISO file contains all the files the BF1942 game checks before it starts. It works perfectly for me. Good luck."
