I have written this book specifically for beginners. I make no apologies to those who are already proficient in WAP to some degree, or who are already programming in another scripting language. After more than 30 years working with and around computers, I know that there is always something else to know or find out, even in those subjects that I think I know well. So I have tried hard to make this book understandable to anybody who wants to write real WML sites for WAP devices, or for anybody who just wants to know what “this WAP thing” is all about.
I have also found that being interested in different fields can provide unlooked for solutions to problems that come up every day. Who would
have thought that knowing WML for devices with small screens would
make me reexamine the way IwriteHTMLfor Internet web sites every day?
Who would have thought ten years ago that knowing how to code in C
would make picking up WMLScript so easy? Or that getting a basic understanding of XML and how it works would make WML such a breeze to
work with?
