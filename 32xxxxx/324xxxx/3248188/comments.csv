Bad Boys Blue - A World Without You may be the best song ever made... I can upload a SVCD when I'm back home within a week -if somebody's interested.
Thanks again!

you should visit: http://www.rygar.nl/  and check out the music from the composer of just that song in that video (not the same person who dances halfnude with some questionable clothes) and his friend Rob Van Eijk  ... aka Area 51   ... buy their cd, its great music!"
