RELEASE INFORMATION

      VCDEasy is a VideoCDs (VCD/SVCD) authoring tool that allows you to
      play/watch your videos (from DV camcorder, DivX, DVD,...), your
      pictures (from digital camera, scanner,...) and your audio files
      (music, audio comments,...) directly on most of the home DVD players,
      without having to buy a DVD Writer and DVD discs. A VideoCD ("Video
      Compact Disc") is stored on a CD (CD-R or CD-RW)... a cheap way to
      make DVD-like discs at home! Read more... To help you, if needed,
      some detailled guides are available on this site.
