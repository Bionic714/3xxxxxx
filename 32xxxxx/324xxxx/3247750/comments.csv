,vonhimmel,2007-08-19T01:17Z,"Nice collection, but a little disappointed ""Baby James Harvest"" not included, although there are a few cuts from it included in a few of the ""Best of.."" albums which you included. I also didn't see the song ""I've got a feeling"" there anywhere. Which album was it originally on? All and all though, thanks. This is the first time I've heard Les Holyrod doing his recent stuff. He hasn't lost it...still better than ever. Thanks again."
