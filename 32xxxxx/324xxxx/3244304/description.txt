Definitive Jux Presents : The Revenge of the Robots Tour DVD
This is a collabo post with myself and heiLand...I could never have posted this without his crucial seeding-help...so thanks for that man 

In Semptember of 2002, Definitive Jux launched "Revenge of the Robots", a hip hop road show featuring indie all-stars El-P, Rjd2, Mr. Lif, DJ Fakts One, plus Eastern Conference’s Cage and Copywrite. Charting their own map, the crew leaves their footprints and tags all over North America and Europe. Destined to be a classic, it’s a reality DVD – the good, the bad, the ugly and the unforgettable. Hip Hop at its living, breathing, cutting edge.
