,metalworker,2004-09-30T14:54Z,I can asure you that it works!
,happymoose,2004-10-02T18:37Z,I just know that it's actually 3CDs and that both MAGE and Pantheon had releases that sucked...
,lilmeanman,2004-10-02T21:43Z,"there's two content CD's which i downloaded from pantheon. They sucked frigen ass. they were like 20 more models, and were 2GB more!

This is very realistic."
,flow3d,2004-10-15T00:17Z,"bah, why download a bunch of cd's :) sure, extra content..but nothing that adds to the program, I've used Lw for a while, all my warez have always been one .zip at about 40mb, everyhing works fine :)"
,scully,2004-11-04T13:53Z,"When installing, a message ""dongle not present"" appears. What is this?"
,Timstone,2004-11-14T16:22Z,"I've DL'ed both the Pantheon version and this one.
When I tried the Pantheon first I couldn't get it to work. So I decided to DL this version as well.

When I'm installing this version I get the message if I want to register it or not. What should I answer? Now I've clicked ""No"" and still couldn't get it to work. Should I click ""Yes""?"
