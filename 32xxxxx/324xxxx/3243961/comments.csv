I open the DVD1 folder and I am greated with no less than thirty fucking zip files with obscure names, a load of other files that don't even look like real files and what looks to be a promising zipped folder with .iso at the bottom. Oh, did I mention there is another copy of the release notes in this folder? I digress.

Upon inspection of the 'iso' zip, there is NO FUCKING ISO THERE.

I am at a complete loss. The setup.exe doesn't work and the release notes seem like they were written by a retard. No support, no contact, no help. NOTHING.
