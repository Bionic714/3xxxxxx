  You paid your dues in THUG. Now prove yourself in THUG 2. You’ve been chosen 
  by Tony Hawk to take on Bam Margera as your teams go on a World Destruction 
  Tour. It’s time to go globetrotting on an insane road trip. THUG 2 grinds 
  in with a hilarious story mode, an unprecedented level of customization, 
  and more moves than the Skate Gods could dream of. Grab your board, an 
  arsenal of spray-paint… jump into the tour van and wreak havoc across the
  globe.
