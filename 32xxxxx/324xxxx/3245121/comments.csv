Maybe you could tell us a bit more about the collection. Are they DVD-rip, how do they compare to the ""Tom & Jerry - Den kompletta samlingen"" collection on 10CDs also on this tracker and are these fairly new cartoons or older (rare) stuff?
Thanks."

Mmhm yes they are DVDrips, you wrote that already. :) But do you know more information like subheadings on the DVD-covers or a link to product info on Amazon perhaps?"
,djkeso,2005-04-06T17:19Z,Just a word of warning for everyone looking for original English Tom & Jerry; audio is dubbed in Russian (or some slavic language at least - I suck at telling which of those is which).
