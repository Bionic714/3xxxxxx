OK here's a double treat for everyone, first up is Suicidal Tendencies from the Bizarre Festival in 2000, next is a rare one Agnostic Front Flipside Video 1984. These two make a great hardcore double bill for all of you, enjoy!

Suicidal Tendencies-Bizarre Festival Germany 20 August 2000 SVCD 63 minutes
Agnostic Front-Flipside Video 1984 SVCD 27 minutes

These are in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and they will play in most DVD players. They will fit on 2 80min blank cd-r using nero.
