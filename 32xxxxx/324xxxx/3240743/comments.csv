Easiest is if you just burn also CD2 to a new CD with ImgBurn, just like you did with CD1 (You can't burn them to DVD...) and use that CD2  when you start game normally.

here's what i did to get it to work
1) Extract both .rar's
2) Mount the file ""SC4DELUXE1.mdf in cd 1 folder, a window should appear where you can choose to install.
3) When it gets to around 50% complete it will ask to insert disc 2, instead mount ""SIMCITY 4 DELUXE EDITION CD2.img"" in cd 2 folder and click ok and it should continue installing
4) When it has finished installing, mount ""SIMCITY 4 DELUXE EDITION CD2.CCD"" in the cd 2 folder.
5) Go into my computer then into local disc (C:), then into program files. find the maxis folder and go into it until you see a folder called ""Apps"" go into that and double click the SimCity 4.exe

It should start up after that :P"

Follow these instructions.
1. Go get Daemon Tools (And yes you have to  restart before installing, so it can install it's stuff to the kernel.)

2. Right click on the daemon tools icon on the task bar, then under emulation enable all.

3. Mount CD 1

4. Install as you would any game using the serial.txt as the serial.

5. Mount CD 2 when prompted. Finish.

6. Enjoy, remember to keep CD 2 mounted when you launch."

You got the game running for the first time because you still had the cd-image in the virtual cd-drive. To get it to run again you can either mount the image in the drive again or get a crack. Crack is a file that overwrites the original .exe file in the program files folder. With that done you no longer need the cd to play the game. Most cracks are available at www.gamecopyworld.com"

If gameplay is terrible slow or have any Graphic Issues.

SimCity 4 Deluxe edition has knowen issues with newer RADEON and NVIDIA Drivers, the only why to get the game to work properly is to set the ""Renderer option"" in the graphics options to software rendering !!! it will look the same as the dx rendering and will run faster."

,lovelf2,2008-10-19T01:17Z,Is there a virus on this game?
,doom_doubt,2008-10-26T06:29Z,"I got it to install and now i am on tutorial area.
This is what i did:
First of all this i have vista 64.
I used Deamon tool and 7z unzip program.  Winrar can also be used to unzip.

Please note: at some point of the installation you will be asked to register.  I did not register so I don't know if anything changes if you do register.

1.  Install Deamon tool.
2.  Unzip the files.
3.  Use Deamon tool to mount .mds file from CD1 folder.  autorun it.  You will be asked to select a language. 
4.  At around 49% you will be asked for CD2, mount the .cue file on the second slot of Deamon tool.  (to set number of drives on Deamon tool right click on deamon tool icon that located buttom right corner of the screen somewhere next to the time, and select ""virtual cd/dvd rom"", ""set number of devices"" select 3, which will give you 4 extra drive).

5.  After mounting .cue file from CD2 folder, click ok to continue installation.  

6.  After the installation is complete, Don't unmount anything.  You will be at a blue screen.  Do do anything.  The computer will seem like it froze (i don't know if this is only on my laptop).   then you will see an EA logo after probably 40 seconds and a movie cliff.  

7.  You will be taken to tutorial area.

Thats all I know.  I didn't try saving and stuff or installing the patch from the EA site.  (The link for the patch is given in the discription of this torrent.

Also there are no virus that were detected.

Thanks"
,Murraym33,2008-11-10T19:11Z,"HELP!!!

I've installed the game fine, however, with eithe image mounted the game loads up, the EA logo appears and moves forward about a quarter of the way (In the standard EA way) and then the whole program closes and i'm back at my desktop.

,jojojo80,2008-11-16T22:04Z,"Easiest torrent game to install ever.  I don't post much but I figured so many people are having so many problems, I'll help you all ou.  Follow exactly and you can't go wrong.

1) download and extract with winrar.  You will have two folers (cd 1, cd2) and a text file containing the serial.

2) Using Daemon tools (make sure you have the latest version 4.30.1) If you don't have it, google it - it's free.

3) Set Daemon Tools to TWO devices.  From cd folder one, mount the .mds file on device 1.  DO NOT START INSTALLATION YET.  On device 2, mount the .img file from folder CD folder 2. When mounting, change daemon tools to *.* all files, so it recognizes the .img file.

4)Now click install.  Enter the serial found in the .txt file in your download folder.

The installation will run and not even ask for cd 2 if you've done this right.  The game will start immidiately after installation.  You DO NOT need the patch or no CD crack if you don't want it.  If you have enough room to leave the cd mounted, I recomend leaving the .exe file alone. If you want the patch and nocd files, find them here:

patch - http://simcity.ea.com/update/index_update.php?product=EP1&x=45&y=12

nocd - http://gcw.fluxgames.com/games/pc_simcity_4_deluxe_edition.shtml

I mounted the CD1 image, then unmounted it to mount the CD2 image and it installed fine.

,Triplehammer,2009-07-27T23:53Z,"A few important things about this upload:
1. Despite the posted info, this is really the North American version, referred to as SKU1 on the official EA update page, and only has American English, and is the Right Hand Drive version (as opposed to the Left hand Drive British English version).
2. What is GOOD about this upload is that Daemon Tools Lite will mount the second disk image correctly, allowing you to play the game without a crack.  Other uploaded versions may or may not get stuck at a picture of a bridge when you attempt to start it without a crack; this one does not.
3. What is BAD about this upload is that the official updates do not work; they fail to update the SimCity_3.dat file.  I downloaded a different upload of SC4 and installed from that, and the official updates worked properly.
4. You want the official updates to work properly so you can run NAM 2009."

Or right click properties on simcity icon, choose ""open file location"" and it will bring you right there. "

Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this?"

Easiest torrent game to install ever. I don't post much but I figured so many people are having so many problems, I'll help you all ou. Follow exactly and you can't go wrong.

1) download and extract with winrar. You will have two folers (cd 1, cd2) and a text file containing the serial.

2) Using Daemon tools (make sure you have the latest version 4.30.1) If you don't have it, google it - it's free.

3) Set Daemon Tools to TWO devices. From cd folder one, mount the .mds file on device 1. DO NOT START INSTALLATION YET. On device 2, mount the .img file from folder CD folder 2. When mounting, change daemon tools to *.* all files, so it recognizes the .img file.

4)Now click install. Enter the serial found in the .txt file in your download folder.

The installation will run and not even ask for cd 2 if you've done this right. The game will start immidiately after installation. You DO NOT need the patch or no CD crack if you don't want it. If you have enough room to leave the cd mounted, I recomend leaving the .exe file alone. If you want the patch and nocd files, find them here:

patch - http://simcity.ea.com/update/index_update.php?product=EP1&x=45&y=12

nocd - http://gcw.fluxgames.com/games/pc_simcity_4_deluxe_edition.shtml"
,will1467,2011-11-11T05:38Z,"HELP

Winrar can't extract the .img file which is needed to be mounted for second disk. Ive tried 7zip and it doesn't work either.

HELP

,neelo5000,2012-01-12T19:57Z,@spanish_ruler Not true.  I have the game installed and running on my win 7 64 machine.  Some people have trouble with it; its a buggy game.  But it definitely does work.

This guy uses this Torrent by ORP to show how to install.  Thanks to his video I found this torrent."
,DACreech,2012-05-06T09:58Z,This was going well until I ran the install. It tells me part of a Mayor Radio file is missing. That means it can not load. Is anyone else seeing that or did I draw the short Straw?  Thanks for the upload anyway. I'll keep working at it. maybe I'll figure something out.
,Lenhoy,2012-05-11T16:29Z,WORKS
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-05-28T08:42Z,"This works fine.
Oddly, i could run it without the crack the couple days, then it told me to insert the cd - and it was still mounted.

Seems flawless - set a custom resolution all good.
Has randomly crashed once, but i blame something else.

This game isn't as great as sim city classic. I can see that it would have much better long lasting appeal - but i dislike the automated roads and lots. In fact, the lots are what kills this game :P Still good fun."

,seedjew,2012-08-20T09:40Z,"Help would be greatly appreciated :(
Okay, so it was a little weird when I couldn't get daemon tools through the winrar files so I had to put my CD 1 and 2 into the downloads so I could mount the files. I installed both of them on there, and when it finished, SC4 opened up. The screen went black, then SC4 opened up for a split second so I could see an icon. It went back to the desktop. I ended the process in task manager, then I installed the patch, but then I read that you don't need the No-cd crack. I opened up SC4 again, only to find that it opens and closes, only allowed me to see very small clips of what is going on. Right now I think it's in the main menu, but I can't seem to keep the game to stay open. I'm on windows 7 btw.
Thanks!"
,chastwood,2012-09-07T16:59Z,any valid active no cd cracks?
