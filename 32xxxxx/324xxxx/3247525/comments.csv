,Level,2004-11-17T20:05Z,"I really hope that the producer have ignored the story in the book, because the author is totally ignorant when it comes to ""how"" it was during those days.Both considering historical facts and the degree of socialization...
"
,getskit,2005-02-27T18:56Z,"Well, i don't think that ""historical facts"" has anything to do with prehistory, since we have neither ""historical"" nor ""facts"" about the period. All we have is artefacts and theories, and even if the author is overusing her imagination a wee bit, it's still a far cry from defying any non-exisating facts about the palaeolithic."
,Dimhirwen,2005-03-31T19:59Z,"I really appreciate if somebody is willing to seed, we're stuck at 92,4% "
,maxnatte,2006-04-08T11:56Z,"Stoppar på 98,6 men det går att se filmen då med vlc bara så ni vet. "

,Sixmax,2008-05-18T14:06Z,"I have it with swedish, norwegian and danish subs. Will people like that version? Will be full DVD rip with a video TS folder... "
,Kraew,2008-08-10T03:28Z,"Takk to a swedish seeder, with 750 - 950 kb/s :-)

I will servive without danish subs, but thanks anyway."
,jonnyfuru,2008-12-11T19:54Z,Anybody knows if there is more films from Jean M Auel?
,Troutking,2009-03-15T01:58Z,"Only movie based on an Joan M. Auel book. And even this one has little to non to do with her book. This is a very very very crap movie. And Mrs. Auel is very, very, very unhappy about it."
,Fireholder,2009-03-15T08:26Z,"There are supposed to be subtitles...
As one observer so astutely observed, there isn't much ""talking"", at least orally.
See, this is because almost ALL of the communication is via sign language...
The subtitles are supposed to be there because of this."
,mnemoc,2009-07-21T20:33Z,English subtitles (srt) from http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3156406/the-clan-of-the-cave-bear-en fit perfectly
,soraya1sasha,2009-12-07T18:01Z,"HI
