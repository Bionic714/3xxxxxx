There is not one universe, but there are many, which is a multiverse. 
Supposing you are just one person, there are many other versions of 
you in the other universes, there are ways to travel, but only a 
police agency,MVA, can travel only for police procedures. Gabriel 
Yulaw (Jet Li)is a former MVA agent, who killed another version of 
himself in self-defense. It made the other versions of him stronger. 
When Yulaw found out about this, he became power-hungry killing the 
122 other versions for two years. After killing Lawless (also played 
by Jet)and getting captured by his former partner Roedecker (Delroy 
Lindo) and a new MVA agent Funsch (Jason Statham) Yulaw managed to 
escape the prison and is trying to kill his last target, Gabe Law 
(also played by Jet) who is a police officer. He is also at Yulaw's 
strength. Roedecker and Funsch now have to arrest Yulaw before he 
can kill Gabe. There is a possibility that the universe could die 
or make Yulaw invincible. After encountering Yulaw for the first time, 
Gabe thought that it was his split personality, but it wasn't. Will 
Gabe be able to confront Yulaw before or after Yulaw ruins his life?

NOTE: I had the choice between a rip that was full screen, or this

quality, especially during scenes with lots of motion.
