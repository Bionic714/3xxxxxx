This is a small prelude between The Fast and The Furious and 2Fast 2Furious.
A nice clip for the fans of FnF Series

This was included on the DVD as special features.
I love the Mitsubishi 3000GT he races in the Prelude, and not to mention the Nissan Skyline R34 GTR V-Spec II.

I think it's awfull the Skyline wasn't the Hero car in 2Fast 2Furious. It so superior i every way!

It's in full DVD quality with AC3 sound.

Enjoy!
