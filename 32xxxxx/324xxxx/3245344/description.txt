Daniel and his mother move from New Jersy to California. 
She has a wonderful new job but Daniel discovers that a dark 
haired Italian boy with a Jersey accent doesn't fit into the 
blond surfer crowd, especially when he tries to date one of 
their girl friends. Daniel manages to talk his way out of some 
fights but is finally cornered by several who belong to the 
same karate school. As Daniel is passing out from the beating 
he sees Miyagi, the elderly gardner leap into the fray and 
save him by outfighting a half dozen teenagers. Miyagi and 
Daniel find the real motivator behind the boys' violent 
attitude is the their karate teacher. Miyagi promises to teach 
Daniel to fight and arranges a fight at a karate contest some 
months off. When his training begins, Daniel can't understand 
what he is being shown. Miyagi seems more interested in having 
Daniel paint fences and wax cars than teaching him Karate. 


This is for all you old school movie fans.
