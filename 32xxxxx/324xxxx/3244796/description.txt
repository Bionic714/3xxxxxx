A collection of cartoons Warner Brothers don't wan't us to know they made! :)


The Censored 11 are eleven cartoons that are considered racist or too politically incorrect by today's standards. This list was created in 1968 by United Artists (then owners of the A.A.P. library) and is of cartoons withheld from distribution by the current distributor. Ted Turner refused to allow any of them to be transmitted on television or released on home videotape or laser videodisc.
