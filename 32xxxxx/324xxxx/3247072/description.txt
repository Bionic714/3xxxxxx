Charlie Bucket, a poor boy who is barely able to support his family, 
is fortunate to be chosen as one of the 5 people to go inside the 
most popular and powerful chocalate factory in the world: The Willy 
Wonka Chocalate Factory. But a stranger, named Arthur Slugworth, 
tempts the kids to steal a piece of candy and give it to him. 
In exchange, he will make them rich. Willy Wonka, played by Gene 
Wilder, soon introduces them to the factory, and starts the grand 
tour around the factory. Once inside, the 5 winners start to run amuck. 
One by one, the 5 kids start to disappear, until it is only Charlie 
that remains. At this point, Wonka starts to ignore Charlie, and then 
tells him why: because Charlie and Grandpa Joe, played by Jack 
Albertson, drank some forbidden product without permission. Will 
Charlie turn against Wonka? Or will he discover that he was wrong 
and make up what he has done?


This is one for all you old school movie fans, I used to love
watching this movie when I was growing up.
