,nilsfish,2008-05-03T23:23Z,"How hard can it be to give info about this crapfile, mkv?!
Never heard of it before and now i have wasted time by downloading, searching info about it and trying to get a freaking free encoder AND i have used 2 DVD´s for the trashbin..FFS!"
,Troy123,2008-05-30T07:06Z,"Mkv is the best file format there is. For playing use VLC or Media Player Classic with added Core AVI Pro. For decoding to video use Winavi, All to DVD or  convert x to DVD. Mkv is the future of torrent videos. Best quality x 264 compression. Can have multiple audio tracks and external or internal srt= subtitles."
,DavidGGG,2009-11-14T21:14Z,"If I'm not mistaken, Troy is thinking of the benefits of x264/h264 vs Xvid/DivX. I don't think mkv in itself affects quality (but it supports more functionality than AVI when it comes to h264). Still, this rip is xvid, so the point is mute I would think. 

And it's no problem playing mkv with any normal PC media player with accompanying codec pack, such as MPC Home Cinema with K-Lite codec pack. If this was a private site, people like nilfish would be thrown out on their little behinds for being so rude to the kind Optivid.

Oh and thanks for the up!"
