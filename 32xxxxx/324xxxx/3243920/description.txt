Jenna Rink has two wishes - to become one of the school cool girls, and to be thirty - rather than be coming up to thirteen and hanging around with uncool Matt. After her disastrous birthday party an accidental sprinkling of magic dust makes both wishes come true and she finds herself at thirty as a highly successful New York fashion editor. Luckily she locates Matt for help on how her new world works, but as she finds out how she has behaved since that birthday party she increasingly discovers someone she thoroughly dislikes.

Excellent movie and excellent sound and image quality!
