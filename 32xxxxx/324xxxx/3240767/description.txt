Windows XP MCE 2004 [SP2-RTM] [Media Center Edition] [Modified Tablet PC 2005 Release].iso

THIS Release is XP Media Center Edition 2004 with SP2 RTM integrated.  
You can finally throw out that old 5in1 CD!  Yeah!

This is a bootable ISO constructed from the official Tablet PC 2005 Edition Release.  Tablet PC Components were removed, as well as upgrade support for Windows 98/2000/ME so it would fit on one cd.  

C3R1AL is automatically entered; includes aktiv8shun patch.
Tested & Working!

[EDIT] Just to be clear, this IS NOT Media Center 2005 Edition, which will be released somewhere between October and November.

Post some feedback!  And let it seed for a while!
