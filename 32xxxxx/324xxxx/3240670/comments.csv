,Aenima,2004-09-21T21:09Z,(even though there are already two other GitS2 DVDrips.)
,Mr.Madsen,2004-09-21T21:12Z,there are !? O_o.. crap.. I didn't find them when I did a search >_< !
,Aenima,2004-09-21T21:22Z,"Ah, yeah.  That's the one I was thinking of.  Must've counted yours in the search results too.  Note that the other one is hardsubbed by a third party, so if the one you posted is a rip of an actual retail DVD, then you're in the clear.

We still <3 you, though."
