Programme 9: Independents Days

The post-punk period of '79 - '82 was a time when the provinces really did rise up and challenge the metropolitan monopoly over music and attempt to complete punk's apparently failed musical revolution. Labels like Manchester's Factory, Glasgow's Postcard and London's Rough Trade and Mute evolved during this time and took the means of production back from the multinationals. We look at some of the key players from this period.

Programme 10: California Uber Alles

We look at how throughout the '80s and '90s, punk continued to influence music-making globally, but nowhere more so than America, through multi-million selling bands like Green Day and Offspring to the punk in contemporary acts from The Strokes to Limp Bizkit; The White Stripes to Blink 182.
