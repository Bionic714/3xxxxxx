The leaders of the scene with over 140 minutes of 1st class and pure goa style!!!
GOA is everything you have ever wished for. It does exactly what it says on the tin and you cannot get any closer to the scene as documented on this high quality double pack! Previously unreleased ORGANIC NOISE ( Novatekk ) as well as TIM SCHULDT's "Trace Back" for the first time on CD make this Album a real teaser. The list of labels cannot be any better! DRAGONFLY, SPIRIT ZONE, TWISTED RECORDS, NOVATEKK, FULL SCALE and DATABASS give their best and freshest tracks. This compilation does not need any more words as X-DREAM, GMS, SYNCHRO, TRANCEFIELD and ELECTRIS UNIVERSE speak for themselves!
