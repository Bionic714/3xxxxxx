,mistawanka,2004-09-28T11:18Z,"LOL - This should be funny to watch.  David Icke is one of the biggest fakes the world has ever seen, once declaring himself to be the son of God...."
,Green,2004-09-28T12:46Z,"Sure he didn´t declare himself to be A (not THE) son of god??? Have heard ""A son"" a few times coming from him, and righteously so when you look at it from that perspective I reckon'... but can you paste in a quote him saying ""THE son of god"", and give me the source, I´d appreciate it.....

Fake or no fake, up to every person to decide... he´s a damn good researcher anyhow."
,orgpunk,2004-09-28T13:00Z,"Hehe. This sounds like fun. For sure in the same class as making soaps out of fat from walking skelletons and elite soldiers sitting down calmly, sewing lampshades out of human skin in the middle of a war with the whole world. :)

Is this considered as a ""fact"" by sitting historians?"
,Todi,2004-09-28T13:09Z,"David Icke är tragisk. Det är delvis på grund av honom och andra galningar som seriösa teorier blir undankastade som ""galna konspirationsteorier"". Det är tragiskt då det är viktigt att ifrågasätta."
,Green,2004-09-29T02:48Z,"04:48, bedtime... precis sett hela filmen nu... 2:55 lång, whoppa!  ...inte svårt å hålla sig vaken dock.. halvkontroversiellt. :band:"
,nash,2004-10-06T10:49Z,It starts out very interesting then suddenly he snaps and starts talking about dragons and shapeshifters... Icke!!
,dd111,2004-12-24T22:00Z,Please reseed if possible. Thank you.
,candance,2005-05-08T00:19Z,Hey! Maybe somebody can upload David Icke ´s   Alien Agenda?
,Tierleben,2005-05-11T16:31Z,"Paranoid schizophrenia, anyone? ...No?"
,electic,2005-06-29T15:27Z,"Icke has never claimed himself to be THE son of god, but rather made the claim refering to WE are all sons of god. Funny how people love to attack this guy because his views are far different then what people are used to. Whether people accept his views or not he is becomming more well known and many more people are starting to understand/believe his perspective."
,MountainLion,2006-02-09T20:03Z,He also talks about the power of the mind and that reality and its shaping from our projection is beeing threatend by this pyramid contstruction of power and media. 
,kane241100,2006-03-21T10:38Z,"jeez guys, those of u detracting from the man need to wise up. he aint nuts, he aint preaching....hell, he doesn't even care if u believe him...the point is, he's researched,followed paper trails,eyewitness accounts,studied,infiltrated...and now he's just sharing his discoveries, thats all. its up to u as to whether u listen. if u don't wanna....thats fine. but don't take th piss if u havent even listened properly"

,InfOr,2006-11-30T17:17Z,i've been seeding this for a while now and i watch as you complete the torrent and then don't seed it :(  should be ashamed of yourselves
,eastern876,2008-06-03T10:23Z,"All David Icke fans will be extremely interested to get the following torrent:

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.

,Nate1978,2008-08-30T00:35Z,I would just like to say that mistawanka is an a@sshole who are you to call anyone a fake at least david is out there letting people know the truth what have you done oh you must be one of the sleepers!!!!!!!! 
,aero99,2009-01-11T17:10Z,Thank you. Will keep seeding:)
,DIVON777,2009-02-11T11:05Z,"i think that David Icke at one point of his life said something like...""you laugh at me cause i'm different...i laugh at you because you're all the same!""..........i love David's research.....he was a celebrity at one point of his life..he was a football player..anchorman...but his research is inspired me to do the same....it realizing that u have been in a cage that's half the battle...knowing the enemy is the other...thnx for upload!"
,cwg138,2009-04-09T00:10Z,"Well, I find it interesting how everyone is totally knocking this video, before they see it mind you, and yet downloads it anyway.... and then doesn't even provide any ""real"" follow-up feedback after they watch it. Cheap people, very cheap.... you are contributing to something, but it's not for our benefit.  Icke doesn't care if you call him crazy, he knows people view him as crazy, in-fact, that's actually a complement from his perspective.  The important thing is that this info is out here for people to watch, and decide for themselves how to absorb it. Be thankful it still is. Thank you Wee-Man!"
,hizman,2010-05-08T00:58Z,"It's sad but understandable to see folks laughing at this film. While it's hard to define whether exactly 100% of the narrative is true, yet the most of information is very much truthful and real. 

I know psychologists that worked with people that were used in the same rituals this woman discribed. And the secret societies is not something new that the world didn't hear before.

Naturally, it's easier to deny the message of this film. Just because you've got to reconsider your entire life and philoshophy, if you take even parts of it as the truth."
