OK here's some Social Distortion for you, its a great show from 1991 at CBGBs. This is the unedited stage camera footage, i have included the clip MTV used but as far as i know thats the only thing shown from it. The vocals are a bit low but its a great thing to have anyway. I filled up the space with some clips, enjoy!
