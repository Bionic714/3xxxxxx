Contains official maps and units not part of Core Contingency, Battle Tactics or the 3.1c patch. All can be downloaded from the official TA page, but comes here as one easy download.

Also contains an ini-file for changing the maximum number of units. (Just edit the file and change the unit count of 500 to whatever you want.)
