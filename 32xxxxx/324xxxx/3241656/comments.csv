,meatball,2004-09-26T10:19Z,"There is a valid license for the enterprise version and for realtime. read the .txt file.

If you download this and plan to use .NET make sure to download Rational XDC posted here. It provides the integrated IDE for your UML models."

,rupayan,2010-01-23T08:30Z,"Guys, there is license for all the modules installable from this package. From the disk 1 'crack' folder, copy the 'rational_perm.dat' to 'C:(or wherever you have installed it)\Program Files\Rational\Common\'. Then re-open the 'Rational License Key Administrator' and you have a license for all the modules!

Hope that helps! :)"
