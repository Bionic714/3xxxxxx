,fckhead,2005-04-08T21:51Z,"Great film ,some sublime kung fu action not to be missed for any fan of the wuxia genre 
the film could have been better quality but its watchable if you dont play full screen"

However, this particular torrent contains a crappy english-dubbed version, so if you want to see this movie do yourself a favor - keep looking."
