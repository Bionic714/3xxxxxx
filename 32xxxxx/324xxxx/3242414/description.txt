You probably remember Space Quest, Larry and other adventure games.
Quest for Glory(Sierra) is similiar, with a touch of action and roleplaying.
You can choose a character from 3 classes(Fighter, Magic User, Thief) and each one will have a story different from the other, so it's fun to check out the other characters after you've finished it with one.
Plus, you can transfer your character from the earlier game into the next game! yay!!!11one

(I have finished 3 of the games, they worked fine, I did try the enchanced version for a bit, and 4 didn't work(said my computer was too good :p)) alltho it should work in DOS(if you have it) or a crap computer(if you have one, I'm sure you do!).

They don't make games like these anymore, so I decided to share it with my swedish neighbours, have fun! <3
