,NoseMan79,2006-04-15T18:12Z,"Would any of you remember a flick in which an indifferent swordsman gets his whole arm cut off, trains himself to exceptional skill and starts to exact revenge. Can't remember the name or the actors, only other thing I remember was that his ancestral blade was also broken and had rings on the off side."

You've no idea how long I've been looking for it."

,MDunn1937,2010-10-15T18:57Z,"NoseMan79, you probably won't see this, but you're thinking of ""The One-Armed Swordsman,"" a 1967 wuxia film starring Jimmy Wang Yu."
,zaroba,2011-01-30T14:19Z,"@ LezDawson:
how about instead of being an ass, you accept that not everybody likes watching movies the same way as you"
,zaroba,2011-01-30T14:30Z,"@MikeQuest
there's a copy on demonoid that has both jap and english audio, along with subtitles.
its a full dvd rip though."

I have a feeling the movie you're thinking of is Tsui Hark's ""The Blade"" from 1995
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112800/
and here it is on the bay
