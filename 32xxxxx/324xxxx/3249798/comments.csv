,DarkSnow,2004-11-08T19:47Z,"Well, it wuld have been nice if you atleast did put the information that it is russian language and polish sub (only) in the description. In case you have not noticed, this is a swedish torrent site, so in general, files shared shuld be in english, swedish or if in other language, with a description DESCRIBING IT.
