,joxter74,2008-08-15T21:24Z,"Why, just why put audiofiles as flac? No normal mp3 player or what ever can play it. You just have to remake the files anyway! Anybody who has a FLAC-Player for sale?? Someone!!??"
,komintern,2009-06-06T21:40Z,"Why upload as flac?
Hm, maybe because it is lossles audio format,  for those who do not have damaged ears and like good quality audio.
I have an ipod shuffle, and almost all my music collection is in flac format. Just dont be stupid, google a litle bit and you will find you can convert your flac files on the fly, while transfering them to your player.
Yes, of course you can burn it as an audio cd. The only difference when you burn flac to audio cd to mp3 is when you burn flac files to cd they are the same as the original cd, while mp3 are lossy crap.
Install foobar2000, amarok, or even k-lite mega codec pack, so you can play it on windows media player.

Many thanks for the torrent ellroy.

P.S. sorry for my horrible english =D"
