Recension fr√•n Amazon.com:

Muddy Waters was his mentor, Willie Dixon his session bassist. 
Reversing Elvis Presley (a country kid who aspired to sing the blues), Chuck Berry was a blues musicians aspiring to play country. 
There have been Presley blues compilations, so it's only fitting that this co-founder of rock & roll should finally get his own. 
Ironically, Blues kicks off with a total rocker, 'House of Blue Lights', which the Flamin' Groovies used as the blueprint for their classic cover, just as the Rolling Stones used this version of 'Down the Road Apiece' as the mold for their own. 
'Route 66' however, is pure Nat King Cole, another Berry hero. Also imcluded are covers of Dixon's 'I Just Want to Make Love To You', Charles Brown's 'Driftin' Blues' and several relatively obscure Berry originals, including 'Wee Wee Hours', the B-side to his first single. 
Climaxed by a tribute to his beloved hometown via W.C. Handy's classic 'St. Louis Blues', Blues stands out as one of the most unique Berry compilations, offering a glimpse of the artist's musical roots.
