www.poltran.com says about ""150 Niezapomnianych Melodii"" - 150 Memorable melody.

Would be nice if you would tell more about this, IN ENGLISH, @€$£""&%#¤.

98% on this tracker don't understand polish.

I would like to test polish music, but i won't download 112MB of something i don't know what is.

Is this grandmothersongs, top of the pop, great songs form the good old sovjettime or lyrics about the bad germans during the war?!?

Sorry for the flame..."

150 Niezapomnianych Melodii 


London Promenade Orchestra 
London Philharmonic Symphony 
National Philharmonic Orchestra 
London Symphony 
English Chamber Orchestra 
Royal Philharmonic Orhestra itd. itp. 

Yet they are not then altered on disco style recordings 
Well-known of classic music placed on six discs CD. melodies are this the most 
I command even men sceptically approaching to serious music sincerely ( someone can it will załapie this bacillus)
