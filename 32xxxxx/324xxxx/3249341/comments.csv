,tias,2004-10-19T17:11Z,Great.. This one actually has a seeder.. :)
,Tsukasa,2004-10-19T17:25Z,"Cool, can some1 verify this has english audio or subs?"
,Brytbroder,2004-10-19T17:34Z,"It's the SSX release, english subs and imo, quite good quality. Watched it last week and liked it a lot, one of the better anime's I've seen.
Enjoy!"
,Atarian,2004-10-19T17:45Z,Oerhört bra serie! Jag skulle dock rekommendera Zhentarim's Ripp av serien. 
,nicken,2004-11-10T06:15Z,skulle nån snälla kunna seeda lite nu på dagen så man får den tills man kommer hem?
,Strek,2005-03-23T11:07Z,"Den er engelsk subbet ja. Tok sin tid for å få den ned, skal hvertfall hjelpe med å seede når jeg er ferdig :)"
,BertVI,2005-04-17T16:07Z,"I need a confirmation of the following statements before I start to download:

1 - The audio is in original japanese. No crappy dubs?
2 - The subtitles are not burned-in. No hard subs?

I want to use subs in my own language, you see. If anyone can confirm this information, I would be really grateful."
,Riore,2005-06-06T14:01Z,Seed please! :/ I am just sick of being at 99.98% and having less then 1MB left. I have been at 1mb for over 24hours.
,ipelaye,2005-07-14T05:18Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD !!!!!
I've been stuck forever at 65%.
I've tryed MANY timesto no avail.
Sadly, no one is realy seeding this torrent.
THEREFORE THIS TORRENT IS DEAD"
,ibutton77,2006-02-08T10:10Z,"65% back in 2005? I dunno, I'm still downloading and all but I'm up way past 90%. I'll see how it turns out. Thanks bryt! :)"
,ex0dus,2007-01-13T14:43Z,"I'm seeding the shit out of this. 

Everyone needs to watch it at least once."
,SnowFire72,2007-01-16T17:36Z,"Thank you, thank you, thank you! I've been trying to find this download for months without prevail! 1 seeder is all I need to download since I max out at 30kbps. Yeah I know, It sucks! So this is going to take about 5 days, so if someone can please keep seeding this for at least 5 days I will be so grateful! Thank you again for uploading this! 

For anyone else looking to download this, I download in parts. Which means if you start now  you will get the first few episodes as I get them. But after I'm done y'all will have quite some time to download the entire thing! I'll seed it for the same amount of time it took to download. Thats my rule of thumb for seeding."
,DoubleComplex,2007-05-02T22:28Z,"i downloaded this, and i think im the only one seeding

if you finnish seed it as much as you can o_o"
,cruelmemory,2007-09-18T19:42Z,"Seed please. I'm at 46% and only getting dl rates of 1.5kbps!

Thanks in advance :)"
,Yoriku,2008-08-28T00:18Z,"Nice, a torrent that's lasted near-to four years... "
,Shade69,2009-03-17T03:54Z,is this dub?
,Serja,2009-06-16T20:58Z,"This is in the original Japanese with hard English subtitles. The quality is great, however. I hope this helps everyone."
,alanalot,2010-03-15T03:42Z,"I archived this torrent (Burned onto a disk and added it to the other 58 archived disks)

If this torrent ever dies out and some1 wants it plz email me at alanalot@aim.com
subject: torrent
body: Serial Experiments Lain (Complete Series) reseed"
,bridgetkfisher,2012-03-31T08:12Z,Dont bother with this it has english subtitles and asian audio so you read it like a book instead of watching it.  Must be for teaching english to children.
,phoenix3000,2012-04-07T21:24Z,"@bridgetkfisher

That's how everyone should watch it. In it's mother language.

If you don't like it sit on your couch and watch ""My Little Pony""....."
,gsu02,2012-06-02T15:12Z,"Thanks, works perfectly!"
