,MTLakesdanny,2008-01-04T06:00Z,"Very good quality, just finished seeding. Download this flim, you won't regret it. Very nice quality by the way."
,FSXFanatic,2008-04-19T07:16Z,do i still need to install additional codecs to watch this video?
,golephish,2008-04-28T08:32Z,was on USA this morning but was falling asleep. looks good though. thx for the upload
,golephish,2008-04-28T08:34Z,"@FSXFanatic > no you shouldn't . people confuse AVI and divx -- Microsoft invented AVI so windows media player should work. If not, get the VLC Player."
,torrent_jim,2008-05-18T02:52Z,"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Microsoft did not INVENT the .avi format you jackass. Get your head out of your ass and stop talking like you know what you're talking about. WMP does not ALWAYS play AVI formats so you NEED DIVX. But you can still play the files through WMP, DIVX just opens with it. 
Check your facts next time instead of sounding like a jackass."
,OscarTheSlouch,2008-05-23T05:04Z,"Hey, Jim, why don't you try getting your facts straight BEFORE you start reaming other people out?

AVI (supposedly Audio-Video Interleaved, but accounts vary) is a FILE FORMAT. DivX is a CODEC.

You can put DivX (or XviD) encoded video into many other file formats, like Matroska, MP4 or QuickTime.

Golephish, just because it's an AVI doesn't mean that MS software will play it. BUT, if you have the right codec installed, it might work.

,eastsider_roadrunner_com,2009-08-05T01:22Z,Did Microsoft invent wmv or is it just an avi with a wmv attached to it?
,Crimson650,2009-08-07T06:35Z,"Really good movie, my grandfather lived in that part of West Virginia and went to school with someone who worked for NASA with Werner Von Braun. Very true story."
