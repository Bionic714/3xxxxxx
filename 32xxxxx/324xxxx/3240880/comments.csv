Someone was stuck with a download at 99% and came up with a solution what worked for him.

Heres what it said;

'copy&paste'



ISO image made from the unfinished (99%) ""Babylon.5.Season.3.DISC6.PROPER.PAL.DVDR-
VLS""

By changing the file extension of the 10 unfinished rar-archives to "".rar"" and then 
extracting them with winrar, with the setting ""keep broken archives"" i managed to 
get the IMG file out (with some error messages), then changing the "".img"" to "".iso"" 
and burned with nero the dvd is fully watcheable, but with 10 very short glitches 
(because of the broken rar-archives)."
