Green Day's first album "39/Smooth" is back in a brand new deluxe
edition. Originally released in 1990 and selling over 900,000
copies to date, this album was the world's first glimpse of Green
Day's unique blend of punk rock energy, melodic riffs and self
depreciating charm. Green Day is the most popular punk band in the
world today with millions of fans all over the world. Every track
has been re-mastered from the original tapes by Bernie Grundman in
2003. This historic album sounds better than ever, and is
available at a new low price. More for Less, how can that be
wrong?s
