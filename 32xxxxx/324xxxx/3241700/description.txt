The fourth album from Dire Straits was somewhat a departure from their earlier material. It was among the group's most successful albums (UK no 1, 4 years in the album chart) and it was also the one that introduced a permanent keyboard player to the group as well as featuring Knopfler producing alone. Mr Pick Withers is in fine form in what was to be the last DS album to feature him on drums.

Of the only five tracks on 'Love Over Gold', the first is one of the strongest songs that the band ever recorded, the 14-minute long 'Telegraph Road'. The lyrics tell a sad story of a decline of an industrial town. The next track, 'Private Investigations' was a big hit for the band which took them into the top 3 in the singles chart for the first time.
