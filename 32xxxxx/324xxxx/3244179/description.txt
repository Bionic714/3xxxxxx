==============================================

THE EXPLOITED Live in Rotterdam!
With Perry on drums. Per was the drummer for DEMOLITION 4, 
which whom THE EXPLOITED toured Holland, back in '92.
Exploited's drummer had a car accident and as Per seemed to 
be familiair with the Exploited material, this show could have a 
GO! instead of cancelling.
This is amazing stuff! Especially when you realize this was the
first time drummer Perry played together WITH the lads from 
The Exploited! 
He was offered a job as EXPLOITED drummer, but being Perry 
means: no concession: he'd miss his dogs too much if he'd 
be playing for Wattie & friends.
Wattie was somewhat surprised by this rejection. His loss for sure!

Perry is one of the best and most steady drummers I know and 
played with (I played bass in DEMOLITION 4).
This is a real document. BARMY ARMY!

CHEERS,
