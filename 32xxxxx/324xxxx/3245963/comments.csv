,pikkus,2005-08-09T00:50Z,"NO STUNT-DOUBLES!
NO WIRE-WORK!
NO C.G.I! 

Is that really true?? And is this REALLY as good as you say??? The last great Martial arts movie was Drunken Matser II..."
,Ran4,2005-08-12T16:29Z,"pikkus - why NOT use wires etc?

Most fighting movies have that.

at least 75% of everything they do in different fighting movie is completely impossible. maybe one in a hundred once a week, but never in an 10 minute long fight (which in reality just doesn't exist - it doesn't take 10 minutes for two fighters untill somebody looses).

Uhm whatever, i'll download it. great!"
,Grave88,2006-06-27T16:14Z,"Dudes, use BSPlayer to play the movie.. Subs work with it."
,maini4ka,2007-10-14T10:19Z,"Domo Arigato for this one, Toba.

,kabalizo,2008-07-01T14:47Z,"amazing, simply amazing..."
,kabalizo,2008-10-27T20:27Z,"God, i love this movie... makes me wanna get up and kick somebody's ass... as long as they're smaller and slower and fatter... and 6 years old... with no big Daddys around to retaliate... Jeez, i'm such a wimp."
,chegski,2009-03-19T21:25Z,this movie is actually called the warrior king.
,Evolfire,2009-03-29T17:55Z,Thanks so much for the original movie. I lost the copy I had and pain $25 to obtain it from some distributor. Thanks!

[T],locobot12,2010-06-25T10:50Z,"Awesome!! Tony jaa is Such a great martial arts performer!! 

Ong bak 1 had no story but tony jaa's fighting made the movie

Ong bak 2 was totally Epic....

Now ong bak 3 ..... i haven seen yet.. hopefully good!!
THX For the Upload!!"
,usabullet,2011-09-26T07:02Z,@locobot12 Ong Bak 3 is not worth watching I was so disapointed in that movie I love Two and one I agree with you his fighting is sick. Funny story I was in the Navy and Deployed over seas to Bahrain and I was introduced to Ong Bak By Thai Hookers lol Prob the best story I have.. Great movie and thanks for the download Toba! 
,lurrch420,2012-02-10T14:13Z,As far s I can tell this torrent is garbage. No audio at all and CD1 didn't even download until I did some tinkering with my client.
