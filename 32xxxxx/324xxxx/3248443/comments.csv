,Belder,2004-10-16T13:48Z,"Okay guys - calm down - it was offered to me as the latest version just last week.

If it isn't what you want, you don't HAVE to download it - but since more than 70 folks ARE downloading as I write this, I must be doing something right. 

Thanks for your patience ;) "

,b0a,2007-07-28T02:12Z,"hey, need help, downloaded nero before, and it worked but then suddenly it didnt work, but thats not the prob, how to i burn dvds? first of all, do i need dvd cd's? and someone said i should burn a pc cd, not a dvd cd, is that right? and how do u get a 1.4gig movie to fit in a 700mb cd, etc? and can you burn a 700mb movie into a dvd cd ?"
,b0a,2007-07-28T02:25Z,"Well, the first thing i mentioned is also a problem now.. I put the Cd in, choose Audio Cd, and then i add and burn, then when its done it says it succefulled without anything going wrong or something, and then it should pop out by it self, but it didn't, so I'm like 90% sure it didn't work this time either.. So, please anyone tell me what to do =/!"
