,codepoet,2011-02-16T22:08Z,"Very, very nice Discography. Great quality, and finally well put together. Best Therion Disc. I've seen, though two albums are still missing. 

Don't worry, I can't seem to find them either. I used to have the second released in 1980, called Accept. Which is what I'm trying to find online with no luck! Anyway, thanks for an awesome upload! (I wasn't complaining btw, just commenting.)"
