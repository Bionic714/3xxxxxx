It's 2019: thirty-one years after World War III and the authority of Neo-Tokyo is waging a constant battle against the Underground rebels. Caught in the middle is a motorcycle gang whose aim is just to make trouble. The gang leader Kaneda gets involved in more ways than one when an experimental psychic child escapes and results in gang member Tetsuo's capture and subsequent experimentation. Tetsuo the "bitter runt" of the pack now has the power of Akira and soon escapes as soon as everyone realizes that his power can result in total destruction of Neo-Tokyo. Directed by Katsuhiro Otomo (Memories, Steam Boy)
