,Morrisson,2005-02-12T12:39Z,"hey there. 
I love asian movies.
but however i am a noob.
please tell me how the subs works.
honestly i don't know how to use them!!!

please? thanks!!!"

you need a prog. called ""vobsub"". Often included in codec-packs like the ""Matroska full codec-pack""  or ""ACE-Mega Codec-pack=All-in-one.""


You'll find it here  http://www.free-codecs.com

When It's installed U put the sub files in the same folder as the movie.
ex.   sph-mom1  ,together with, sph-mom1.sub  ,in one folder...
and  sph-mom2 + sph-mom2.sub in another folder.

Then,when you want to watch sph-mom1....vobsub will load the subtitle file   sph-mom1.sub for you automatically....just make sure the name of the sub-file has the same name as the movie-file and ends with   .sub."
