"Who are they?" asks the burly leader of a pack of motorcycles savages. Before the dust
settles and the last piston throbes,he'll especially know one of them is.so will movie fans.
  Mel Gibson gave notice that he eas a name to reckon with in the revved-up,trend-setting
first of gibson's Mad Max collaborations with filmmaker George Miller. Gibson portrays 
Max Rockansky, the fearless, leathersuited cop waging war with kill-crazy bikers who targeted
his family. It is a war that must be seen to be believed, a road-scorcing, neo-punk, 
take-no-prisoners combat set in a post-apocalyptic Australia. In the end , alone man travels
a ribbon of highway now free of unroadworthy - a highway leading Gibson to stardom.
