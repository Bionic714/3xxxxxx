     ú  BAND INFO
     ú  ----------------------------------------------------
     ú  THIS IS THE NEW DRAGONFORCE ALBUM, NOT THE DEMO!!!
     ú
     ú  London's DRAGONFORCE (formerly called DragonHeart),
     ú  released their incredible demo 'Valley of the
     ú  Damned' back in June 2000, taking the metal
     ú  underground/internet by storm. Number 1 on mp3.com's
     ú  power metal chart for over 2 years beating major
     ú  band like Blind Guaridan. As an unsigned band, they
     ú  already toured with Halford, Stratovarius, and
     ú  finally signed a deal with Sanctuary early this year
     ú  (Iron Maiden, Helloween). Now they are back with
     ú  their long awaited debut album to take on the metal
     ú  world beyond the net!!!
     ú
     ú  This is the best power metal debut for a long time,
     ú  or maybe even the best PM album of 2003. The guitars
     ú  are absolutely insane, as well as really good songs
     ú  through out the CD with a great singer!
     ú  They call themselves 'Catchty Speed Power Metal' you
     ú  will know why after a listen, break neck speed not
     ú  for pussies! ;)
     ú
     ú  There are rumours flying around, the CDs in the
     ú  shops will contain many hidden music video not on
     ú  this promo, so this is the one to buy after your
     ú  x-mas holidays!
     ú
     ú  More info on the band including DiVX videos to
     ú  download at: http://www.dragonforce.com

     ú  ----------------------------------------------------
     ú  NOTE TO NEWBIES/NEW FANS
     ú  ----------------------------------------------------
     ú  A lot of people might be getting confused with this
     ú  release! Five of the songs here were released on
     ú  their demo 2 years ago under the band name
     ú  DragonHeart which are still available on mp3.com to
     ú  download.
     ú
     ú  All the 5 songs of the demo have been re-recorded
     ú  and sound even better.
     ú
     ú  All rips here are from the album promo, not the
     ú  demo. We labeled the songs in such details to avoid
     ú  the confusion for you newbies when searching on the
     ú  net for them. Be sure to download their demo from
     ú  mp3.com as well to see the huge differences between
     ú  the 2.
     ú
     ú  P.S. There is a shit band call DragonHeart still
     ú  around from Brazil, they are not the same band so
     ú  don't get confused with their albums and
     ú  DragonForce's :)

     ú  OFFICIAL PROMO BIOGRAPHY
     ú  ----------------------------------------------------
     ú  Well-know in the underground for years, it is now
     ú  time for Dragonforce to finally deliver their first
     ú  full-length release due out in stores on January
     ú  20th, 2003.  The album is being released on the
     ú  'Noise Records' label.
     ú
     ú  DragonForce is somewhat of a rarity, based in London
     ú  England, they play a brand of music that is almost
     ú  non-existent in their location. Formed in September
     ú  1999, formerly known as DragonHeart, the band
     ú  changed their name in December 2001 to DragonForce
     ú  to avoid confusion with other bands, record labels
     ú  and movies under the same name.
     ú
     ú  The band is powered by the twin guitar assaults of
     ú  Herman Li and Sam Totman, with singer ZP Theart,
     ú  drummer Didier Almouzni, and keyboard player Vadim
     ú  Pruzhanov. An ordinary line up it may seem at first,
     ú  but DragonForce is uniquely backed by a diverse,
     ú  multi-culture international line up (Hong Kong,
     ú  England, South Africa, France, Ukraine) never seen
     ú  before from a young new band.
     ú
     ú  In short, DragonForce's sound can be best described
     ú  as a mix of modern melodic power metal with the fury
     ú  of speed metal, but the band's influence comes from
     ú  wide across the metal spectrum. Catchy melodies that
     ú  stick straight into your head, combined with
     ú  outrageous speed, power and totally over the top
     ú  dual guitar wizardry are just some of their
     ú  qualities which separate them from the masses. Most
     ú  importantly underneath this sonic fury lies the
     ú  band's indisputable strength, their song writing.
     ú  Take any of their songs and you will find enough
     ú  hooks to fill an ocean, enough technical process to
     ú  satisfy progressive metal lovers, guitar solos to
     ú  have you playing air guitar combined with catchy
     ú  melodies and the strong voice of an outstanding
     ú  metal shouter.
     ú
     ú  Well known in the underground, DragonForce has
     ú  already toured with Halford, Stratovarius, Virgin
     ú  Steele and successfully headlined their own show
     ú  across England without an album out then. Previously
     ú  known simply by the word of mouth among metal fans,
     ú  and their songs on mp3 through the internet, the
     ú  band is now more than ready to take on the world
     ú  with their long awaited debut album 'Valley of the
     ú  Damned'.
     ú
     ú  'Valley of the Damned' was recorded in 3 different
     ú  locations between May and October 2002. The drums
     ú  were recorded at Jailhouse Studio in Denmark with
     ú  producer Tommy Hansen (Helloween), further
     ú  recordings took place at Thin Ice Studios with
     ú  producer/guitarist Karl Groom (Threshold) and at
     ú  band guitarist Herman Li's home studio.  The album
     ú  truly shows the band's talent from performance, song
     ú  writing, all the way to production!

     ú The 19th of May symbolized a special time for us here in
     ú AMRC, it was time to take a look back at when AMRC was
     ú born three years ago.  We've come a long way since then,
     ú and would thank all the people who have supported, and
     ú helped us in our endeavors for the past three years.
     ú Big greets go out to all of our friends in the scene,
     ú siteops who have been loyal to us, fans of metal music
     ú worldwide, ANY metal bands reading this nfo, and other
     ú metal crews in the mp3 scene.
     ú
     ú We hope you enjoy our releases which range from black
     ú metal to progressive rock and everything in between, a
     ú lot of times the bands we are interested in never get
     ú any attention because they aren't trying to fit into the
     ú current mold of mainstream music.  Regardless of what
     ú people at the RIAA, or the bands themselves might think,
     ú we don't do this to take money away from artists.  In
     ú fact, if anything, by releasing music from these artists,
     ú we hope to get them heard and potentially build up some
     ú interest worldwide, and would like them to develop a
     ú larger fanbase.
     ú
     ú If you are taking the time to read this nfo and check out
     ú this release, please consider the fact that the artist
     ú you're going to listen to probably put a lot of effort
     ú into releasing this piece of work.  If you really like
     ú the band, listen to some of their other discs, research
     ú them on the net, because all bands in the world have
     ú potential to help someone obtain the mood that they're
     ú searching for at any given time.  At times you hear
     ú people say "so and so only rips lame shit", or things
     ú like "I hate them, they suck", but keep in mind that
     ú everyone in the world is different, and has different
     ú tastes, not only in music, but in life as well. If you
     ú don't like something a group releases, then nobody is
     ú going to put a gun to your head and make you listen to
     ú it (unless they're fucking psychos and need psychiatric
     ú help), so don't put other groups down for releasing the
     ú music they believe in, or treat them like they have
     ú nothing to offer because you don't like some of their
     ú releases.  If they release some things that aren't for
     ú you, then so be it, wait until that release you've been
     ú waiting for does come out, and if they never release
     ú anything you like, there are lots of other groups out
     ú there for you to check out.  Let all release groups
     ú coexist together in peace without bashing each other
     ú because of differing preferences, let's keep things as
     ú friendly and secure as possible so that we may safely
     ú continue doing what we love to do in the future,
     ú release kickass music!
     ú
     ú Remember... an album worth listening to, is an album worth buying!
