From Dave vonKleist, co-host of The Power Hour radio program &amp; writer/producer of the album Will Someone Listen, and William Lewis, producer &amp; director of American Freedom News, TruNews and Police State comes a full length documentary presented in a modern, stylish TV news-magazine format. &quot;911 In Plane Site&quot; uses news footage from all of the major news sources in an in-depth analysis which shows that what was originally reported on the morning of September 11, 2001 is not what has become the official story of that day. Eyewitness accounts and live video feeds told the real story of 911 and they are presented now for the first time as evidence of the largest cover-up in modern day history. With the pounding force of a sledgehammer you will find yourself horrified and astonished at the shear scope of the largest transgressions ever carried out against the people of the United States and indeed... of the entire world.

OBSERVE! When viewing the cloud that appears separately from tower one and tower two, please keep in mind: 

Building Seven, a 47-story structure, was damaged when Buildings One and Two, the Twin Towers, collapsed across the street. Building Seven collapsed a few hours later. - from CNN:

In other words; building nr 7 can not have been the source of the cloud. This makes this particular footage similar to the Zapruderfilm of the Kennedy assassination. The question is if anybody careâ€™s this time around?
