,Frezzno,2004-10-06T08:25Z,It's even worse. The few I'm connected to only get 1 or 2 kB each.
,Therion,2004-10-17T07:40Z,"I don't get it.. I install it, replace the .Exe files and add the .Pal file.. still i dont get it working.. how come.
I tried it both on Windows Xp and Windows 98.."
,Coleco,2004-10-18T00:44Z,"I'm having trouble cracking it.I've replaced both the EXE's and the pal file,But it still wants the cd."
,bugsy8715,2004-10-19T01:21Z,"Hey, I just dl'd this through BitTorrent and I need some help...
So, in the folder where I downloaded it, I've got a directory called ""WH40k _CG+12patch+noCD"" and in that directory are 3 files: cgate12.exe, Warhammer_40000++_Chaos_Gate_v1_2_NOCD-Razor.zip, and WH40k_Chaos_gate.ISO. 
I extracted the .zip file to a new directory and in there I've got a folder called ""Anim"" (and in there a file called ""warhammer.ani""), file_id.diz, install.txt, wh40k.exe, wh40k.pal, and wh40k_td.exe.
If I run either .exe I get an error saying I'm missing Wing32.dll.
So, what do I do now?"
,Frezzno,2004-10-23T00:37Z,"Hm... Sorry for this delay, but I have stopped playing this game. But I will help as the best I can.

1. Burn the ISO file to cd or use Daemon Tool to simulate the CD.

2. Install the game.

3. Execute ""cgate12.exe"" to patch the game.

4. Extract the NOCD-Razor zip file.

5. Copy the two wh40k exe files and the pal file to your Warhammer installed folder.

6. If you find the game slow because of all the character animations you can replace it with the one provided from the zip file by copy ""warhammer.ani"" (0 bytes) to the Anim folder in the game installed folder.

Well, this was how I did it when I played. You will also notice (if you get it to work without the CD) that there will be no CG movies when you start the game and when you start a new campaign. If you would like that to show up without the CD just copy the entire movie folder from the CD to the game installed folder. I've forgot which folder it was, I have deleted this game.

Good luck"
,bugsy8715,2004-10-26T00:47Z,"It works! Thanks a million, man!"
,Taffsadar,2004-12-21T19:39Z,"I have followed all the steps in the guide and it have worked fine, the program do however seem to refuse to start. I'm able to get the small window you get when you open the CD rom but I have been unable to get further."
,zubutix,2005-02-16T01:56Z,"Har nån manualen till spelet i E-form?

Kan man inte tilta kameran i spelet till marknivå? Jag lyckas inte. tycker man ser för lite av världen runtomkring!

tack för svar"
,Frezzno,2005-03-23T11:19Z,I don't know what  I thought when I deleted this game but I'm loading it back now.
,Saladfingers,2005-06-22T13:19Z,"Well i have an even worse problem :P i start the .exe with the crack installed, but nothing's happening! the process wh40k.exe is running but it's just lying around at 3300kb and not taking any CPU.... 
i got the same thing when i installed the demo some years ago.. but that was on another computer :P so it kinda pisses me off. anyone had the same problems?"
,Frezzno,2005-07-01T12:02Z,"Man I hate it when someone misses a chance to a fun game. If you use XP try right click the exe file and choose compatibility win98, ME or something. It might work."
,Ranulf,2005-08-08T10:17Z,Sedda är du snäll. Tack
,fizzybeef,2006-05-17T12:32Z,"right, ive followed all the steps and game runs alright...until i click to enter combat. loading screen comes up then resizes a few times then game turns off....what the hell is going on? anybody had this?"
,ged2,2006-05-22T06:30Z,"the game dosent start it is in the ativity window but dosent use eny cpu or eny thing what to do???

,noballsjim,2006-09-05T20:41Z,"i followed da steps but it doesnt work, its like for saladfingers...( the process wh40k.exe is running but it's just lying around at 3300kb and not taking any CPU )...., 

and i tried changing da compatibility  like frezzno said but it doesnt work.... :(  

so... do i need to install win 98 or what?!? ...

why o why darn lol help me please"
,Tyrion111,2006-10-07T12:49Z,The game crashes when it's my enemies turn to move. Anyone else with the same problems? I run Win XP.
,DudeDanny,2007-01-30T20:08Z,"not sure if anybody is still interested in hearing this but chaos gate is not supposed to be compatible with anything later than win 98, and the backward compatibility of XP doesn't seem to work either. What does work however is an emulator to simulate a win98 operating system, so just download one of them. Apparently there is one on microsoft.com, but i never found it."
,KeyReaper,2008-02-22T01:56Z,"Sigh, well, I got the game installed, updated, and cracked all successfully.

When I run the mounted CD file, the window with the buttons 'Play, Un Install, Install DirectX6.0, ect..'
appears, but when I click play, the window disappears and nothing happens.
I tried it in 98 compat mode and in 95 mode.
No luck...     any ideas?"
,TaichiCi,2008-05-28T11:47Z,ok its like this i diddent copy the zip file it worked fine with out it on xp i tryed few times to see whats wrong about it and evry time i copy zip crack only game window open but not the game so try with out  it only run patch tho
,cadia,2008-06-28T16:47Z,"I´ve set the compability to win95 works great, thanks man!"
,AnTi90d,2010-01-06T20:00Z,"I couldn't get it to run on ME. The EXE files would just crash the computer, so I deleted them. Running it normally it would start.. show the intro movie.. and then go to a black screen. Reinstalling the game with or without the patch did nothing. Thank you, though. It is nice to see a torrent up and running after 6 years."
,arjay2277,2010-04-23T23:26Z,"if anybody is having any crash problems with xp i found a page which helped me:   http://www.ntcompatible.com/Warhammer_40k_Chaos_Gate_on_XP_-_help_t26525.html

,termite43,2010-09-28T09:33Z,"Windows 7 x64 and I can run this in Win98 mode.  I can't apply the update or any no cd patches, but it will run with the image mounted.  I love windows 7.  There's many more modern games that have worse compatability issues than this.  Thank you."
,PandaBearUK,2011-05-10T14:06Z,strangest thing not loving my win 7 but when i put it on my laptop running xp it works a treat without patches or crack. great game. thanks for the upload!
