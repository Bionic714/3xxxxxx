A must for the serious Dylanfan - the complete Rolling Thunder Review rehearsals from 1976.
A four-cd set, ripped at 320 kbit AAC (.m4a).
Sound quality varies, but this is the definitive edition of the rehearsals.

I'll keep on seeding for a few days but please chip in with the seeding when you're done - it's a large download and any additional seeding will be helpful.

Enjoy!
