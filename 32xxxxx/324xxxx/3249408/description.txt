 High Quality Scans
====================

- High Quality Scans are preserving video game documentation. We hope to create the most extensive collection of scanned video game manuals, freely available to everyone.

- If you redistribute any of these files, please do not tag them or add any type of copy protection or encryption. Please do not support any sites that do this - let's keep it free and clean for everyone!

- If you would like to contribute, send us an email at contact@hqscansorg.org
