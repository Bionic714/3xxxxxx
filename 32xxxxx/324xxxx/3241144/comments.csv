,Elazul,2004-09-23T11:12Z,"Tackar så mycket! Ettan var verkligen en toppenfilm, rekommenderas till alla som gillade Ringu, Dark Water med mera."
,Queen_Ingela,2004-09-23T12:05Z,"Finns det text till denna, lite svårt att förstå kinesiska annars ... "
,xstream,2004-09-23T12:13Z,"Ettan var bra men denna var faktiskt riktigt dålig. Se ""One Missed Call"" istället. Samma man som gjorde Ringu filmerna har gjord den. Klart bättre än The Eye 2."
,psykopat,2004-09-23T13:37Z,"One Missed Call är en bra film, men det är inte samma
person som gjort Ringu filmerna utan Takashi Miike.

,Kyry,2005-07-22T07:31Z,"I'm sorry to tell you that this version is seriously amputed.  There is a good 20 minutes missing from different ghosts showing and mostly, ""no ghost between the leg of the woman on labor"",  it's a censured version.  At the end, the girl go on the roof, then jump, have the baby, it's over, you don't know anything.  Well, in the real cut, she goes 2 times on the roof, leave a blood trail AND you get to see the ghost coming between the legs and thus know what the movie is about.

Pathetic to dislike this movie just because you see this cut."

,Piller Triller,2007-06-17T15:23Z,"Nice :) But, is this the Japanese version? There is a English version of this film too, right?"
,BigAndGreek,2008-02-23T19:28Z,Thanks so much!!!
,PirateBrowser,2010-11-20T20:08Z,"Pathetic to censor a horror movie. It's horror because it's supposed to be scary and not because we are supposed to guess what happens. The scene that Kyry describes doesn't even sound very scary. Is there an uncut Chinese version too? I want the real deal and not some crappy ""Hollowwood""-remake."
