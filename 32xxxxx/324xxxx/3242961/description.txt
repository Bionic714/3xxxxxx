You know what this film is so we'll skip the introduction. This Japanese version is the only fully uncut version of the film with the entire "House Of Blue Leaves" ending fight scene in all its bloody color. Forced to make the R Rating for the US release, Quentin Tarantino had to make the scene in black and white so it looks more cartoonish. The entire scene in color has a dramatic effect on the film. Apart from the color scenes, small bits of gore are added throughout the film (2 extra minutes) that are missing from the U.S. version.

The torrent also contains soft subtitles for the non-english parts. Make sure you get a player that plays subs, such as <a href="http://www.bsplayer.com">BS Player</a>
