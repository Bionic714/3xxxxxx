,VonGURRA,2004-09-29T14:24Z,hmm kan ingen ladda upp nån version som ligger under 700 mb
,IceBone,2004-09-29T21:30Z,"It's 23.976. I don't think there's a PAL version of the Uncut out.

And you're gonna have to wait a few hours untill i start seeding, unfortunatelly. :( There was a little mix up."
,trashstar,2004-09-30T01:40Z,"VonGurra... 111 minuter, alltså finns det ingen scenrelease på en disc. 

dessutom, en så lång film så mkt action på en disc? 861 kbit/s att dela mellan ljud o bild=750 kbit/s video. låter inte sååå roligt..."
,IceBone,2004-10-02T14:25Z,"ATTENTION: Since i was a dumbass, i didn't check the entire movie before submitting, so a bunch of subtitles (20 lines all in all) are missing.

,stiyjle,2007-02-22T10:22Z,"I'm uploading this version a lot, will upload it about 8 times (have currently uploaded it 4 times) at about 100 kb/s.
Keep seeding this one, by far the best quality version I found on the net."
,Conquerist,2007-02-28T01:15Z,"Great movie and release dude, but some subs are missing and the ones you posted on plankdoo are a dead link. Can you please reupload them?"
