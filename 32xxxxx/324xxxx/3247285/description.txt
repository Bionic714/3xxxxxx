Style XP 2.15

Release Notes:

How sleek is your desktop? Style XP unleashes the
full potential of your Windows XP desktop by
allowing you to download and install XP themes.

Style XP is not a skinning engine. It uses
Microsoft's built-in visual style engine, but
enhances it by providing many useful tools. Style
XP can import, select, rotate, and manage themes,
visual styles, wallpapers, and logons.


NOTE: The ARN release from 2004-08-11 is rubbish,
we couldn't make it work on two different systems.

This release includes Style XP versions for ladies
and men, and for those who are uncertain :)
