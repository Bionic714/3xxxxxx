I never read books, its just not for me, but like 10 years ago i found the first book and i couldnt stop reading it! Love adams explanations and ideas about everything.  read it, you get it cheap these days. get the whole shobang, i think its 4 books in the big one. but actually 5 books total with whole continuos story."
