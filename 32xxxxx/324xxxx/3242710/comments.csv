,nathanael_stvenson,2009-03-29T23:47Z,thanks Just what I needed here is a link to how to use Norton ghost 2003 two clone/copy your  hard drive for a more faster and bigger hard drive this can even if you?re hard drive is bad and making a lot of noise and clicking this will get you back up and running in no time .  Time is depended on how big or how small your hard drive is by cloning/copying. my 20 GB hard drive took  a half an hour. now my old hard drive that was making noise and lots of clicking and freezing up and crashing because the hard drive over heated causing the disk to get damaged is now copied/cloned to a bigger and faster hard drive makes more time for me because I don?t have to reinstall my OS just follow the instructions here at this link http://www.bay-wolf.com/ghostclone.htm it will show you how to clone/copy your hard drive it?s just like having a real copy of your hard drive even if you?re product key is a bulk product key this well help you not  to use the one on the side also it is great to have when you buy a thrift store computer with a small and limited space available on the hard drive but first you must save your product code.  Here is a cool program that can pull up all of your registry key codes on your hard drive just download it then double-click key finder EXE and it well pool up all of your registry key codes on all of your registered software even if the program is bad and corrupted and damaged here is the link to it http://magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/ it is not add where or spyware or scare where it is simple and easy to use thanks for the torrent just what I needed if anyone needs help please feel free to e-mail me  at stvenson_nathanael@Yahoo.com for any questions or comments you have once again thanks for the torrent I will keep speeding as long as I can afford my Internet service

Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3416361/Norton_Ghost_2003 instead

That is the complete Nero-Disk image of the CD,
(and yes, that CD contains also Actrobat reader 5.)
