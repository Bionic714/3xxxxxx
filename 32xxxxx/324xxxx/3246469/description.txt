<b><font face="Arial" color="#800000" size="2">One Season. Thirteen tournaments. 10 Million. And it all comes down to this. The champions from each of the 13 tournaments on the World Poker Tour's historic first season, square off at the incomparable Bellagio, Las Vegas. Only six champions, Gus Hansen, Juha Helppi, Chris Karagulleyan, Howard Lederer, Ron Rose, and Jose Rosenkrantz, will meet head to head, card to card, chip to chip at the World Poker Tour final table--and only one will be crowned the WPT Champion of Champions, walking away with a six figure cash prize, plus a 25,000 seat in the next WPT Championship, a tournament with a prize pool worth over 8.6 Million.
