They don't believe in the law of gravity and they don't care about the law. Paris' youth idolize them. The police hate them. They are the Yamakasis, modern samurais, warriors in the war against the ghetto's dark and sad reality. With acrobatic skilfulness and adrenaline pumping belief in their own immortality, they throw themselves out from incredible heights, and jump from roof to roof. Locked doors and "No Trespassing"-signs is irresistible challenges. Sky-high buildings are only made for one thing, climbing. But one day, one of their young fans try to I imitate a stunt and he fall down. Now there's only one thing that can save his live, an unbelievably expensive operation, an operation the family to the boy under no circumstances can afford. This is when the wealthy upper-class in Paris will experience, that advanced security systems isn't enough to keep out the Yamakasis.
