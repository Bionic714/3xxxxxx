,johan1122,2005-04-27T22:22Z,I'm also stuck on 97% and it has been so for quite a long time. I agree with the others and think that it would be hilarious if any of you guys who shared part 1 could do the same with part 2!
,dragget,2005-04-28T17:52Z,Seeda!! Snälla!!
,Better,2005-04-28T22:32Z,"This is also posted under DVD 1.

Ok, I got you the 100% of DVD 1. I haven't got the stamina to do the rest. The rest of you, help us all out. It's labourious and you have to do it right so you don't lose what you already have downloaded. Here's how I did it:

1. Use DC++ and search for ""taken dvdr fov"" (without the quotation marks).
2. Once you find someone with the rar files (make sure it's disc 2, 3 or 5), save as favourite user so you know where to find next time.
3. Get the user's file list and download the whole Taken folder.
4. Go to your BitTorrent program and check which files you already have 100% of.
5. Go to DC download tab and delete those  files. Also, delete the sfv filecheck file, you have to use the sfv file downloaded by your BitTorrent program. If the sfv file is already downloaded (it's small, so it usually get there quickly), delete it. You don't want it! We don't want you to have it!
6. Wait for the download. This, and finding a user, are the hard parts.
7. When you have a couple of files, make a copy of the sfv file in the BitTorrent folder for the specific Taken version and put it in the DC++ Taken folder. BUT: First check that the sfv file is 100% downloaded.
8. Run the file check file. You need a check sum program for that. I use hkSFV, dl from http://www.big-o-software.com/. There might be newer programs out there, this one crashes every now and then.
9. If the file checks OK, AND ONLY IF THE FILE CHECKS OK, do the following:
10. Turn off downloading in your BitTorrent program (in BitComet, right click and select Stop).
11. Go to the BitTorrent Taken folder and delete the files you now have in the DC folder (or save them in another folder so you can restore the dl if you fail).
12. Copy the new files from the DC++ folder to the BitTorrent folder.
13. Rehash the torrent! In BitComet you right-click the torrent and select Manual Hash Check.
14. When hashing is finished to 100%, resume download. Now you are sharing a few more percents with the rest of us!

If you all use the priority level in DC++ arbitrarily for a couple of files, we might be getting somewhere.

I don't expect all of you to do this, but if a few does it... As I said, I did disk 1, haven't got the stamina for the rest."
,Tommy64,2005-04-29T14:54Z,Snälla kan någon seeda denna torrent??
,johan1122,2005-04-29T23:07Z,"Obviously, it's taking some time to converting the files into .rar. So I might not be able to seed until tomorrow morning."
,Better,2005-04-30T22:31Z,Here we go. Don't forget to seed in your turn.
,YQball,2005-05-01T02:29Z,"to Better, thank you very much for doing this great
job seeding this torrent for us
keep doing what you do"
,karl68,2005-05-01T09:13Z,"Works like a dream :-D Great, thanks!

Any chance someone got complete dvd 3 & 5 ? 

Seed, please. :-)"
,Benji_9,2005-05-01T10:05Z,THX!! I´m seeding like hell and will do so for a long time so that others won´t have to wait so long that I have (3 months ) 
,johan1122,2005-05-02T19:21Z,"Better: You know I'm able to upload the last parts to. I got both pt 3 & 5 on my computer. I rented the series from a video shop and caught the opportunity to rip them to my computer (I knew you guys would like to have them). They're in .bup, .ifo and .vob files, which are the usual files you burn in nero.

What shall I do to upload them? Not pack them?
Are they useful at all?"
,Better,2005-05-03T00:36Z,"Absolutely! I would love those files so I can compress as I want to. But you have to make a completely new torrent out of them. You need to figure out how to use your your torrent program to create a new torrent file to upload to Pirate Bay.

I use BitComet, and I would click the Create button and go from there. Make sure you specify the directory where all the files are when you create the torrent file. I wouldn't specify a tracker, cause you can upload the torrent file you create from here at Pirate Bay (click the ""Ladda upp"" link)."
,Peracer,2005-06-23T11:21Z,"Jag hoppas ni seedar över helgen (Midsommar så man har denna serie att titta på regniga dagar under semestern.

tack på förhand!"
