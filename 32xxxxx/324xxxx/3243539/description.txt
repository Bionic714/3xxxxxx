Long deleted and very hard to find, this is the rarest June Tabor release.  This is a collection of rarities generally unavailable.  "As I Roved Out" is a simple,eloquent lament that will leave you dewey eyed with an aching, nostalgic aftertaste.  One her best pieces.  Also, rousing versions of "White Rabbit" and "All Along The Watchtower".
