Spy Sweeper safely detects and removes traces of spyware including Trojan horses, adware, keyloggers, and system monitors (for example, Gator and Xupiter). Regular updates provide timely protection against new threats. A quarantine feature allows users to safely manage spyware by removing or keeping it, without harming other programs on the computer.

Version 3.0 adds hijack, IE Favorites, Hosts file, Startup, and Windows Messenger Service shields.
