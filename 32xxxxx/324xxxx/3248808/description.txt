Wong is a master martial artist - a drunken master, it turns out, 
skilled in an ancient form of combat that involves a bobbing, 
weaving, cross-eyed style of fighting that throws his opponents 
completely off-balance. His stern father has strictly forbidden 
him to use the potentially shameful style, but when foreign gangsters 
threaten the nation, Wong has no choice but to defy all the ancient 
codes of tradition in order to save China's most sacred treasures.
