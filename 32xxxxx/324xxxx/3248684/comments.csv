Detta är ju bara spyware/adware från Google, inget nytt alls."

:axe: Not to be a bitch or anything like that, :no:  I think it is pretty cool that you speak sooooo many nice languages. :P

However, any civilized & educated person :smartass:  (such as yourself) :rolleyes: would know that Spanish is one of the most spoken languages in the world. So you should be able to recognize it for what it is and not just mere ""jibberish"".

The fact that you do not speak it or understand it, does not qualify it as ""jibberish"". If you are really interested in the content of the page, :book: Google has a very nice translator for you to use untill you learn a new language. :ras:

Oh, and Thank You for enlighting us with all your knowledge on foreign languages! :dots:"
