Alright here is a very rare programme from the Irish TV vaults, its a documentary on the Oucasts from the late 70's, its quite an amazing thing to watch and i'm sure you will enjoy it. 

Outcasts-Self Conscious Over You Irish TV SVCD 38 minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
