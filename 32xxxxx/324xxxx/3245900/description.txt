Delivering top shelf gameplay that captures the speed, finesse, and 
hard-hitting action of pro hockey, EA SPORTS lights it up in its 13th 
season of NHL action with NHL 2005. New EA SPORTS Open Ice Control
allows players to execute complex offensive plays such as give-and-
goes and breakaway passes or call for a defensive double team with 
the touch of a button. EA SPORTS Dynasty Mode goes even deeper with
a new, easier to navigate interface, and more interactive GM/owner 
relationships, including a new email system. NHL 2005 also delivers 
all the action of the hotly-anticipated World Cup of Hockey, with 
the top eight International Teams and venues from North America 
and Europe. 

BTW - This game features a lockout mode where the players and owners
bitch about the millions they should be getting / losing. It's quite
fun! Check it out!
