,ggggggg,2005-02-11T19:53Z,"The strangest thing happened. I renamed the season 1 folder, and those 9 ( not 7 ) files which could not be viewed before now work perfectly even if the file is just 99.1% complete. SO download it works fine. By the way use VLC to view"

,rave_rune,2006-02-08T10:51Z,Hur i hela världen får man fram de engelska rösterna? Lyckas bara få fram japanska!!! även fast jag panar från left till right??
,ufo,2006-02-20T16:37Z,På en del filer måste man välja Ljudspår 2 och på andra använder man bara Högra kanalen.
,Abraxsis,2006-04-10T05:15Z,"Damn! I love this show and to finally find all the seasons in one place, then after spending hours downloading to find out all the episodes are in Japanese is SOOOOOO disapointing!!!!

Does anyone know where to find these in ENGLISH???"
,tezrin,2006-04-10T20:33Z,"They are bilingual ENGLISH right channel sound, Japanese left. The first episode seems to be Japanese only but the rest work fine. Use VLC player on your computer to select channels. There is a file in the download that explains this, as always read instructions before complaining. Keep this great show alive."
,Abraxsis,2006-04-11T03:07Z,"Wasn't planning on watching them on the pc. Wanted to turn them into dvd's for normal tv viewing. Not sure if I'll be able to do this with the basic software I always use.

Would much rather the plain US versions anyway, without that weird japanese stuff at the beginning of each episode. Just ruins it for me. I'll keep searching I guess."
