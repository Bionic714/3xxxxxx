,Wieeeeeee,2008-08-17T02:06Z,"Wow, I heard a song on the radio from this group and never remembered the name before... I always forget how they were called, until I decided to write it down and repeat it 100000 times until it was stuck in my head.  This group is awesome!

Thanks a lot of these, very much appreciated!"
,Gnarizard,2010-05-02T18:41Z,"""There She Goes"" is not by the Cranberries.
It doesn't even sound like them.
And ""In Your Head"" is the same song as ""Zombie"".
Other than that, I guess the rest of the songs are good.
Next time just make sure you don't have duplicate files, and for the love of God, be consistent.
Some of the songs are ""Cranberries - xxx"", some are ""The Cranberries - xxx"", and one is ""the cranberries - xxx"" (no capitalization at all).
A for effort, though."
,Gnarizard,2010-05-02T18:47Z,"Oh yeah, and ""Ode To My Family"" = ""Does Anyone Care"".
And I should add that ""There She Goes"" is by The La's."
