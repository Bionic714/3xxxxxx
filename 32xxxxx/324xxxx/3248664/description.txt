Proper Notes: 

The AoH release was improperly cropped, and no ivtc was performed. 
AoH has stated in their "NFO fix Addon" that the dvd isn't standard, this is correct, 
but we feel that it's no reason for an improper rip. 
Please note we've released this as a 1 cd xvid (115 mins) as it's a screener.
