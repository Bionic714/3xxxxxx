,Mad_Viking,2005-05-10T22:36Z,"I had some problems with the sound track not matching the movie. And a lot of flicker about half-way and the rest of the movie!!

I think the size (617MB) matches  the quality..

But good movie.. :-)"

,GoldenHurricane,2011-05-13T12:48Z,"Quality is good but messy during few seconds
Audio is not bad but you had to turn the volume very loud

But well for a 2 hour movie, 617 MiB is not that bad"
,BH99,2011-06-13T13:10Z,"Played well enough in VLC, but video became bad and audio out of sync towards the end on DVD-R.

Not worth it unless you can't find a better version.

Thanks nonetheless."
