A 19th century Western directed by Tom Dey, Shanghai Noon stars 
Jackie Chan as Chon Wang, a clumsy Imperial Guard to the Emperor 
of China. When Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is kidnapped from the 
Forbidden City, Wang feels personally responsible and insists on 
joining the guards sent to rescue the Princess, who has been whisked 
away to the United States. In Nevada and hot on the trail of the 
kidnappers, Wang is separated from the group and soon finds himself 
an unlikely partner with Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), a small time 
robber with delusions of grandeur. Together, the two forge onto one 
misadventure after another.
