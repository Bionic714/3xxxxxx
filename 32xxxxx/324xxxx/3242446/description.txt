  If BARCODE had the slightest bit of knowledge or respect, they
  would have asked TMG the permission to use their NIS PRO 2K4
  keygen instead of stealing it. As a result, talented TMG crew 
  would have told them that it wouldnt work and that a new       
  dedicated keygen was needed. But they didn't bother.           
  Enjoy this fully working and legit release made possible by our
  SSG heroes! :)                            
                                                               
  Installation Notes: Unrar->Burn->Install             
  -> Use the Keygen inside /CRACK dir for install & activation     
     Disconnect from inet or block with firewall when activating 
     After a couple of tries it will redirect you to phone    
     activation where you can use keygen to activate
