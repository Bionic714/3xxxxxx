,mambi30,2004-09-25T11:14Z,sorry to say it - but this time TPB wasn't the fastest. I got it of another site a few hrs ago. But paying respect to TPB I felt the need to share it with all you guys - because let's face it: TPB RULES - keep up the good work

,RealGuy88,2005-01-01T01:05Z,"Hi there,

Well just need a little help.   I downloaded the file, and used HJ-join32 to join the files, but how do you burn it?
what has to be converted into a bin or cue file, or what needs to be done?  I need some help thanks in advance"
,mambi30,2005-01-01T17:38Z,"the files should not be joined - unrar the .001-file with a new version of f.ex. winrar or powerarchiver. That should give you two files after unpacking: .cue and .bin.

Those can be burned to a CD using f.ex. NERO (burn image). or you can run the program from a virtual drive using Daemon Tools

READ the .nfo. file before installing, if you want to be able to activate the product!!!"
,RealGuy88,2005-01-01T18:27Z,"Thanks so I will give it a try using one of these programs just got to find it.
f.ex. winrar or powerarchiver"
,Marx182,2005-01-20T16:34Z,What is a tda-file? and how do i use them? please help!
,mambi30,2005-01-20T22:52Z,"TDA is short for The Divine Alcoholics - the group bringing the release to the public :-). 

You need to open the file called 'tda-nis5.001"" with f.ex. winrar (or my preferred tool: powerarchiver) to extract the cue/bin that gives you the program.....

but do not ignore the tda.nfo-file!!! It gives you info on how the release must be installed... if not followed it might not work!!!"
,Cetnik,2005-01-28T11:55Z,"Tjabba...

Man kan öppna filerna med dessa program: 
         (Winace och Powerarchiver) 
Dom kostar men du kan typ testa dom i 30 dagar och sen avinstalera dom..."
,desovski,2005-02-20T19:32Z,I get CRC-error when unpacking the .bin and .cue files from the archive? The files were downloaded ok since there were no errors unpacking them to get the complete file. Anyone experiencing similar problems?
,Rutger_,2005-03-07T21:00Z,"Jag har fan mega problem... =S Jag har laddat hem flera Norton produkter och testat installera.. Det är samma sak för Norton antivirus och Norton Internet security...
Installationen avbryts och det står att filen instops.dat fattas ?   Svara gärna //Maddox^"
,emax,2005-04-04T11:21Z,"when you've got a CRC-error there is no shortcut, you'll have to delete the file with the error, and then download it again.
in the future you should use:
piratgruppen.org/irc
there's always someone who can help"
