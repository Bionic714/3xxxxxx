Proper Notes: 

If BARCODE had the slightest bit of knowledge or respect, they 
would have asked TMG the permission to use their NSW PRO 2K4 
keygen instead of stealing it. As a result, talented TMG crew 
would have told them that it wouldnt work and that a new 
dedicated keygen was needed. But they didn't bother. 
Enjoy this fully working and legit release made possible by our 
SSG heroes! :) 

Installation Notes: Unrar-;Burn-;Install-; 
Use the Keygen inside /CRACK dir for install & activation 
Disconnect from inet or block with firewall when activating 
After a couple of tries it will redirect you to phone 
activation where you can use keygen to activate
