Is This A Single CD Or Double

What Happend To CD2?"
,duckman,2004-09-27T16:22Z,"AERO is a 5.1 surround sound album but in the same package is a CD-version in normal stereo. These MP3's are unfortunately only the stereo version. The 5.1 mix is fantastic!!! Wait for the DVD-rip!

P.S. You can buy the album at www.cdwow.com. No extra charge for delivery."
