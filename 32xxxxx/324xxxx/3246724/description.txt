After completing his military service Eun-shik (Lim Chang-jung) enrolls in the university with the aim of passing the high-grade government official exam.

However, his goal seems to be miles away because he unfortunately runs into Choi Sung-kwok (Choi Sung-kwok) who served in the same army headquarters he used to go to. Persuaded by this person to join a club for bodily fitness, Eun-shik frequently fails to meet the requirements of the university.
