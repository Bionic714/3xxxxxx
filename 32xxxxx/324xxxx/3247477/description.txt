  The award-winning flight combat from Oleg Maddox's IL-2 series moves the 
  setting from the Eastern front to the fierce combat of the Pacific theater. 
  Allied fighters and bombers square off against the notorious air power of 
  the Japanese empire. For the first time, a large variety of British aircraft 
  will be included along with the U.S. and Australian planes. Target enemy 
  ships, vehicles, airfields, and a host of AI-controlled aircraft. Re-enact 
  some of the most famous air battles of WWII in places like Pearl Harbor, 
  Guadalcanal, and Iwo Jima.
