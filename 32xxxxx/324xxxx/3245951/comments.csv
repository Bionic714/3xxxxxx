Har mye av det allerede, men må ha resten også...

Takk!"
,Ramboy,2004-10-10T08:36Z,"Jeg ser at mappen inneholder torrent-filer for alle albumene. Hvis de er seedet, kunne de da ikke bli lastet opp? Mye enklere når man bare skal ha noen få av albumene og har resten."

Also, concert albums, special releases, and they do remix a lot of other bands stuff."

,minoria,2006-06-21T21:27Z,"I will start by thanking Barca4ever for this great collection, downloaded fast and everything is perfect..."
,minoria,2006-06-21T21:31Z,"This one goes to all the stupid people that say rammstein doesnt have 25 albums, if you think they dont, then you are a lazy bastard and you should die. "
,minoria,2006-06-21T21:31Z,"

I hate people that dont do research before they post a comment. It is so damn easy, just gotta go to rammstein.com and look at the discography... sigles count as albums, there are 32 albums!!!.. and that is not even counting remixes, or special editions like muttertag, which is in this torrent... so there are more than 32 albums!... OMG.... "
,minoria,2006-06-21T21:32Z,"I cant leave without telling Mr_gaspedal that Rosenrot Does Exist!!!! it is their latest album and it kicks ass..... so you are officially a retard... you do not deserve to listen to rammstein....

Thanks again for this great torrent.... and sorry about the 4 posts, the site wouldn't let me put it all in to 1...."
,Mr_gaspedal,2006-12-22T18:41Z,Ahh I meant it isnt in the torrent so please stop crying
,empire22,2007-01-31T04:19Z,"Personally, I found Rosenrot a big dissapointment after the awesomeness that was Reise, Reise.  

They found this poignant balance of hard rock and poetic beauty from title to finish in that album.  In Rosenrot, they got a little soft, and it lost the drive that makes it so appealing.  A good album, nontheless.

I have to say that I don't quite consider a single to be an album persay, I think people think of LPs when they see Album, not EPs"
,DaLuniz,2007-02-21T21:22Z,SEED SEED SEED
,nisije87,2007-04-19T20:16Z,seed folks!! plz!!!! i've got to have this:) seedseedseedseedseedseedseedseed
,juergensen,2007-04-25T00:19Z,"Good torrent, but there is no 25 albums of RAMMS+EIN, you should make a difference between albums, singles... e.t.c. name it discography(if yo`re grandomaniac). :)BTW this  torrent Rules. And if you like it byi it cos TILL gonna find you"
,elementalnature,2007-09-23T19:22Z,Seed guys.. come on its  a 2/1 ratio... this terrible. lol.
[T],MrLore,2008-02-24T14:00Z,"Where did you get '25 albums' from? They haven't made that many.

Official Releases:
7 Albums (5 Studio, 2 Live)
22 Singles (1 of which was discontinued)
1 Demo Album"
,kirchmaster,2008-03-19T00:08Z,dude i use limewire pro to download torrents its alot faster
,Spyke88,2008-07-15T02:34Z,"Don't be so mean to the suckers that say that Rammstein hasn't made 25 or so albums, they probably only count Studio Full Albums as Albums, as do I tbh, but you are right that they have recorded more than 25 cd's of various kinds.

ps. Rammstein Rocks! ^^"
,solid.steve,2008-09-13T23:46Z,"i just want to comment to say thank you to Barca4ever for uploading this

it took me about 14 hours to download but not going to complain, got a differant discography downloading and thats on 69% (started at same time)

and to minoria i havent looked at there album's yet (there complete set) like you say its lazyness but i will say this is a nice all round torrent full or not (even though i had to untick some cd's i already had)"
,[x],2009-04-22T22:13Z,"Barca4ever, thanks for your hard work!!!

,huemac,2009-08-16T09:15Z,"it seems to be ridiculous that NONE OF YOU ...who perhaps have already downloaded the entire torrent....don't happen to tell what is the quality...

what is the quality...it is just stupid that not even BARCA4 ever tells that basic info!!!!!!!!

anyway...thanks for the hard work man!!!"
,ghettowizard,2009-09-24T08:42Z,"ha ha ha feuding over the internet, because when ur life sucks, u can make others lives suck equaly online.... who cares its free its here enjoy damn it before its gone..."

,iCEE_Shodan,2009-11-02T03:56Z,"I'm just gonna post a comment that I'm too sotned to do any research. if research needs me it will know where to find me :)

So I'm gonna light up another big L, and listen to some mofucking RAMMSTEIN!!!

Greetings to the world! Get stoned!"
,tybomb3,2009-12-02T18:53Z,great torrent.  i'm averaging 150k.  cant wait to rock on to some rammstein.  thanks for the post
,Rattlehead1889,2009-12-30T01:39Z,"I have Rammstein's entire regular album discography, so I'm just looking for the non-album songs.  I looked at the list of non-album songs (actual songs, not remixes) at http://herzeleid.com and I see that this torrent has all of them except the following ones:

Jeder lacht
Schwarzes Glas
Pet Sematary
Pesnja o trevozhnoy molodosti
Schtiel

Does anyone have all the songs on that list on that website?  And does anyone have MP3's of the songs on the bonus disc of Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da?  I could only find a torrent with them as flac files, which are better, but since iTunes and the iPod are gay and can't use them (they are made by Apple after all), they're rather inconvenient."
,.Venom,2010-03-16T20:01Z,Stop spitting each other for a moment and post more details about quality for fucks sakes!
,.Venom,2010-03-16T20:03Z,"I'm planning to get this, so give more details."
