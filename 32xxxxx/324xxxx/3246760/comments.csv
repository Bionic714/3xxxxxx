The EP was (in my opinion) absolutely brilliant, I have tried to buy it to no avail. Does anyone have a copy of this?"

,NoCode0680,2010-08-06T07:24Z,"meddyliol, Five By Five was indeed a Rolling Stones EP, but it wasn't live and all the songs can be found on the 12X5 album, so that EP is obselete now.  The Stones only released 3 official EPs and only one of them was live.  It too is called Got Live If You Want It, but it is not the same as the full LP.  Three of the five songs from the EP can be found on the US versions of the Stones catalogue.  One is on Out of Our Heads, the other two on Decembers Children, they are the only live songs on those two albums so you will know which ones they are.  The other two songs are not on other albums, and aren't on the LP of the same name.  The only way to get the full EP is on the Singles 1963-1965 box set.  "
