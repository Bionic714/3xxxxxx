There's really nothing to dislike about this album.  Perfect production and arranging.  Great vocals and musical performances.  And if I had to choose a song to dance around the floor to, it would be "Love Letter" without a doubt.  Bonnie blends a mixture of blues with funk and rock and roll effortlessly and this album surely deserved all the accolades it received. A must-have for any great music collection.
