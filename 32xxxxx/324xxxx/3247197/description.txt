Part IV in a George Lucas epic, Star Wars: A New Hope opens with a rebel ship being boarded by the tyrannical Darth Vader. The plot then follows the life of a simple farmboy, Luke Skywalker, as he and his newly met allies (Han Solo, Chewbacca, Ben Kenobi, C-3PO, R2-D2) attempt to rescue a rebel leader, Princess Leia, from the clutches of the Empire. The conclusion is culminated as the Rebels, including Skywalker and flying ace Wedge Antilles make an attack on the Empires most powerful and ominous weapon, the Death Star.

PROPER NOTES:
SCREAM released this with 4-pass CCE, and is a nuke according to the "rules". And
my personal oppinion is that a movie like this should get a few more passes..
Anyway, they had 3500 average bitrate, and we 3850 with more passes.

Heeey! Expect more from us in the future!
