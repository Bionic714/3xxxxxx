,Helixa,2007-06-08T12:29Z,"he/she said it in the first post that he/she would only be seeding for a week and that was a long time ago. so that means some twank didnt continue seeding. 

f***ing remember this then, when you d/l something check how many that has the full file before you stop seeding, if there is none then dont stop. or else this shit happens."
