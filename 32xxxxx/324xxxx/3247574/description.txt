Elfen Lied(Action, Horror):

The diclonius (two-horned human) was a mutant created by humans. It had 
horns, and had special ability that could be described as sixth sense. The 
mutant's had enough power to exterminate the whole human race. Afraid from their power, they were isolated into the national research facilities to be studied.

However, by an accident, a girl of diclonius broke out of her confinement, killed the guards, and escaped from the laboratory. On her way to escape, she fell into the ocean and drifted to the city of Kamakura. There, she met Kota and Yuka. They named her “Nyu”, and began to live with her.
