This is the second DVD (Bonus DVD) that comes with 
             the Dream Theater - Live At Budokan DVD.  It contains 
             a tour diary, interviews with John Petrucci and Jordan 
             Ruddess in which they show some of their equipment, 
             a drum solo by Mike Potrnoy and the 2004 tour opening 
             video.  

             

             Note: There is also a multiple angle bonus track titled 
             "Instrumedley" which I removed from this release due 
             to issues with the various angles, if you want to see 
             that, buy the DVD!  Due to removing this track, no 
             compression was required, so the rest of the footage looks 
             great!  Enjoy this fine release from AMRCMPG... and once 
             again, buy the damn DVD if you like it, Dream Theater is 
             awesome!
