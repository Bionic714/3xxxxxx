,JohnDough,2005-08-03T00:11Z,yes. like me. and it aint too nice. in fact it's pretty bad. more than that. it sucks. I would even say it's a pain in the ass. a quite strong pain. so I hope I made this clear now. such a great release! and I came a little bit too late ......
,nigel_1,2006-01-26T11:04Z,"downloaded the files - all rar in a folder, but when i go to start the extraction, a message says files corrupt - anyone else having issues and any idea what to do about this?
thanks"
,iamdagreatkornholio,2006-02-23T06:26Z,"Need help. Found out that after connecting the files, there is no English subs. Any assistance is appreciated. 

Btw, any recommended software to join the files in order to restore the English subs?"
,teletubbed,2006-03-14T08:49Z,"Subtitles: I found out that the Subtitles exist, if you play the movie from the mounted image, so they should/must be available when the iso file is burned into a DVD. "
