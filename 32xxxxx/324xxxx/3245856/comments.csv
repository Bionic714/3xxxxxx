,pinecone,2005-04-19T21:07Z,"I should note for those who care about this sort of thing that this release is in fact dubbed. From the first few minutes it did not appear so bad, but considering that chinese kung-fu flicks are generally done over pretty horribly by the US import companies...

I'd still prefer a subbed cantonese or mandarin version if anyone has it."
,pacificwaters,2005-08-09T04:14Z,it's not japanese...it's chinese...the movie is based in china of the shaolin monks. understand?
