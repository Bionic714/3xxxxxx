A young father and his infant son are beset by forces of evil and 
corruption. They wander China, upholding their sense of honor and 
protecting the weak. When they are forced into combat, spectacular 
and hilarious fast-motion kung fu sequences follow. In the end, 
they must call on all of their abilities in a battle royale, 
to attempt to vanquish a supernatural man-monster or die trying.


This is a classic japanese martial arts movie, with none other
than Jet Li!

Quality: DVD Rip Divx 608x336
# of Cds: 1 with English Dubs.  


Note: There are about two seconds of corruption (1:15:47-1:15:49)
that will stop any normal video players dead in their tracks.  
Use VLC player (best video player ever) which will play through 
the corruption, and allow you to hear the audio and see the 
slightly misformed video during those two seconds.
