SOMEBODY SEED!  It won't take much!"
,phaezshre,2009-02-09T20:54Z,"Please seed, we're stuck at 96.4%

Seeders will definitely be appreciated."
,phaezshre,2009-02-14T16:59Z,"Come on! Someone seed for at least a few hours so we can get this finished. All of us are stuck at 96.4%

,wade989,2009-12-09T10:09Z,"I just pulled out a dvd i had this backed up on, some of the data is unreadable but i got 30 full rar parts (wod-arcade2.part01-22 &  wod-arcade2.part40-47) hopfully this will complete your downloads, if so could you seed till i got 100% too. 
I need to wait till one of you connect to the torrent so it will build my directory then i'll place my already dl'ed rar parts, force recheck & seed what I can. we'll get through this!"
,Spartahog,2011-10-03T16:32Z,"I know this torrent is 7 years old, but would anyone kindly re-seed this old torrent? Just until I am able to get the rest of the 67% of it and will seed?"
