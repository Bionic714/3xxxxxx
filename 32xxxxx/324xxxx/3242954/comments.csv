To everyone, this film is amazing, you must watch it.
The quality is great, great subs, and the film itself is probably my new favourite."
,tofusoldier,2009-01-23T09:55Z,"always handy to have non-porn movies with ""porn"" in the title for those awkward occasions where your aunt finds your stash.  Ahaha.  
No, it's just japanese ganster movies, really.

Hah.
Uhh, good movie, though.
Good rip, too.  
Highly recommended."
