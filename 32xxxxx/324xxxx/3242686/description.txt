I think I may have missed a film between round 4 and this one but I am not certain. Since the stupid commentators don't give a clue about it I decided to post this one anyway.

This is the second last one before the final. (5 out of 7)

I also have other films from this event. 
- WSOP Omaha event
- WSOP Ladies NL Hold'em
- WSOP Seven card stud
- WSOP NL $5000 Buy-in
- WSOP Pot Limit Hold'em

I can post them on request since some of them are a bit odd.
