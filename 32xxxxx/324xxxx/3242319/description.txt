As usual this has various rare punk rock tv appearances, This is a bit of an early 80' special with a cool suprise included. The One Way System isn't from any official video and the Slaughter & The Dogs clip is a promo type clip from Italian TV, the Sect is pro shot, enjoy! 

This is in VCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
