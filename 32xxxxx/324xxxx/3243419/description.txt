This was exclusively compiled for the german Bertelsmann Club. Though it's just another Best Of record including their most successful hits such as smash-hit "Mama Loo" (which is still a must-have for every second class party), Mexico, Jennifer Adam, Carnival and so on, and so on ...

For the germans: The infamous JÃ¼rgen Drews was a member of the Les Humphries Singers. So you better think twice before prejudging him.
