A 12 year old boy goes missing in 1978, only to reappear once more 
in 1986. In the eight years that have passed, David hasn't aged. 
It is no coincidence that at the time David 'comes back', a flying 
saucer is found, entangled in electricity cables.


This is one for all you old school movie fans, I used to love
watching this movie when I was growing up.
