,ggggggg,2005-02-25T13:27Z,Which are the episodes that complete the download please? So that one can download only the complete eps with bit torrent and the others via other sharing software since this .torrent file is only 60 percent complete thanks.
,dmx123,2005-02-27T10:07Z,"if you have a complete episode of season two then put it in the directory and it wil help us all to complete the second season of this show. I have put a couple eps in the folder so if its ok we should be able do download a bit more now.

MAKE SURE SIZE AND NAME ARE THE SAME!!!!

You can only replace file s when program is offline, so you have reseed it again."
,ggggggg,2005-02-27T23:42Z,please tell me which episodes are not complete so that I can get them from somewhere else and replace them and seed the complete file. THanks for replying
,ggggggg,2005-02-28T00:31Z,If someone tells us which episodes need to be redowloaded from somewhere else I can exlude those episodes from currend download so that i do not waste time downloading the incomplete parts.
,dmx123,2005-02-28T00:58Z,"the episode that are not complete are 11 till 23. I am also trying to get them from somewhere else but it goes very slow.

Ill keep you updated if i have more eps.

By the way i think season 4 needs a lot of episode because there s only 30 percent availeble"
,ggggggg,2005-02-28T08:44Z,"great, if you do this for all other seasons i'll put the missing ones on e-mule. and try getting them from there."
,dmx123,2005-03-10T00:13Z,"He,

I am still trying to complete the seasons for this show, the problem is that there are still a lot of eps that arent complete. If i play then in VLC The audio is only japanese. Anyone else has this problem??

So i would like to know how far you guys are."
,Jockha,2005-04-10T16:27Z,"is anybody else trying to get some missing episodes? I am trying , but it is very hard. I really want to have these episodes, so if we all try to get some episodes from other places, we can get them. Or somebody could just seed this one again."
,dmx123,2005-04-14T14:42Z,"So as you all know by now its very hard to complete these episodes. i got season 2 up to 95% i think that eps 11 and 12 arent complete and ill keep sharing for a while.
Ill also hope that you all keep sharing to because its really hard to get them (i took me about six weeks) with emule.

So enjoy and keep sharing!!

I am also working on the other seasons but i cost al lot of time so please be patient and please also try to complete a couple episodes."
,Jockha,2005-04-14T16:44Z,"i'm trying to download eps from emule for season 3, it is going very slow though but if everybode does a little, it will go much faster"
,dmx123,2005-04-14T16:51Z,"i have a couple of season 3 complete to with emule, tell me your username and and can give you a buddy slot if i see you there."
,Jockha,2005-04-16T12:51Z,"my username on emule is Jockha, but why don't you add those episodes to season 3 here on piratebay. That would be easier."
