,Maharaja-Krishna,2009-06-16T03:08Z,"If no seeder comes back not all the files (tracks) will be (selectively) available / usable. I know how it is frustraging to be stuck at 99%...  :-)
I suggest you have a look here http://isohunt.com/download/87926073/green+day+american+idiot.torrent as this torrent seems to be dead for a long time (except for some single tracks).
Hope this helps.  :-)"
