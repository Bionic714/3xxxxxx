Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 
Release Date: 10/19/2004 

The action is packed into another exciting series of adventures with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles™ 2. Only the best can turn chaos into control with simultaneous play for up to four players in both cooperative and head-to-head modes. TMNT fans will once again assume the role of the famed heroes-in-a-half-shell – Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael. Featuring kick-butt, non-linear story structures, the games allow players to punch, kick and duck their way through battles against The Shredder and his evil pack of Foot Ninjas. While younger fans of the Turtles will be thrilled by the varied selection of attacks in these all-new rock-em-sock-em adventures, nostalgic fans will be “green” with excitement when they unlock the classic TMNT arcade-games of their youth!
