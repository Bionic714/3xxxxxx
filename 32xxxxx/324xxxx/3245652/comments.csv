The first one contains splitted MP3s with a quality of 320 kbps. The second, is a single OGG file with a quality of 350 kbps. If you are familiar with soundForge, or another sound editing program, I recommend the second, since OGG has a quality far better than MP3.

Also, check out my release: Creamfields 2004:
