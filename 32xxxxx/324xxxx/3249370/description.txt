Since he's currently on tour in the UK, I thought it would be nice to put up some of his albums - here's the first.  

Jackson's Browne's first album came out in January 1972. The title was simply "Jackson Browne". However, the cover design included a photo of a water bag with the words "Saturate Before Using" on it. Since that time, many people have mistakenly called the album "Saturate Before Using".
