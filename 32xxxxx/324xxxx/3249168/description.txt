This CD surprised me a lot. It was such a drastic change from what Garth had been doing. The whole feel of it was a lot peppier, but somehow he managed to keep it from sounding the least bit corny. The sad songs on here are really sad, but it's mostly upbeat stuff. "Do What You Gotta' Do" was a hard-hitter. "I Don't Have To Wonder" has to be one of the saddest songs I've ever heard. "Belleau Wood" is a beautiful song, for those who haven't heard it. A lot of these songs made it to radio, but they're still worth having on CD. Seven was a lucky number indeed for the Garth man.
