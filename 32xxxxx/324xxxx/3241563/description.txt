OK here's 2 videos by the Macc Lads with covers ripped in SVCD, they are both hilarious if you like your punk rock drunk and in the gutter covered in spit and vomit. These will both fit on one CD, enjoy!

Macc Lads Beer Necessities 1990 SVCD 27 minutes
Macc Lads Three Bears 1982 to 1988 SVCD 33 minutes

These are in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. They will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
