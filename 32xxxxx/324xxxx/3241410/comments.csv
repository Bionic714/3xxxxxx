,jaybee276,2006-05-14T09:54Z,"There are certain critical parts of this tutorial that has broken sound. It occurs when interacting with complicated video/sound sequences. Either that or my puter is Fu*****d
I will try on another puter.
Anyone else having these problems?

BTW seeding now not a problem - only one day to download this. But what is the point if it is FU*****d   I ask???"
,jaybee276,2006-05-14T11:05Z,"I have got it working now. If the tutorial is in a Daemon drive the audio breaks up. Making a real CD and putting it in a read drive cures the problem.

What a fantastic program this is. I can rec. it to anyone who loves music. Now anyone with a will to learn can do it...

Jaybee.... the next One Hit Wonder???   
I wonder!!!"

,pirate1,2006-07-05T18:08Z,Please seed!! :D
,K0RT,2006-07-16T02:16Z,how come no one seed a program like this?
,truetype,2006-08-24T00:24Z,I have same problem with audio being all messed up on subsections. I tried to burn to cd it didnt help at all.  How do you fix this?
,truetype,2006-08-24T01:50Z,"Ok, I figured out a solution.  Open the cue/bin file in daemon tools. Then goto the virtual drive and explore it. There is a directory called movies. You can play that in whatever player you want.  This got rid of the audio problems for me."
,Flowerboy85,2007-02-13T10:53Z,"Cool, But There is a better one , ""ASK Reason 3. 0 Tutorial DVD "" 3.4 gig of Reason Tutorial , I heard this is the best one..


Anyone can download this and put it here? would be great!"

,imacracyguy,2008-03-08T09:26Z,"I loaded the file with daemon and the tutorial loads, but a lot of the videos run blank. I've even explored the bin/cue with magiciso and some of the videos work that way. Frustrating. "
,vincent198,2009-03-21T13:55Z,Someone who know the Serial Number + USERNAME ??? 
,Caithleann,2011-04-26T23:36Z,"These videos do not really ""run"" blank, they are corrupted by the original uploader, wherever that was. The videos are completely corrupt with the headers mangles and the 12-20.mov in fact being a piece of the UltimateSurvival website. Somebody screwed up big time.  The files that are corrupted are:

01.00.mov
02-00.mov
02-01.mov
02-03.mov
12-00.mov
12-08.mov
12-09.mov
