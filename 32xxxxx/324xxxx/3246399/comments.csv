,plankt,2004-10-11T15:49Z,I think this program deleted windows xp's built-in defrager when i uninstalled the program (diskeeper).. Watch out :/
,Marco_One,2004-10-11T19:28Z,"And the serial number for Registration Prgram???

Where is????


Thank you!"
,gummi,2004-10-11T20:32Z,"I find it strange that this is version 9.0 when only 8.0 is available on the official home of Diskeeper:

,gummi,2004-10-11T23:05Z,Why won't this program work unless you connect to the internet?
,pax,2004-10-15T10:28Z,"Ok. No registration or reg-code is needed, this is indeed version 9.0.504.0 and you don't need to connect to internet to use it.
How do I know? Well, I use it and it works like a charm, I just told ZoneAlarm not to allow Diskeeper access to internet, I read the versionnumber in the ""About Diskeeper"" window, and I use the pro version without a reg-code or registration of any kind.
So now you know ;)"
