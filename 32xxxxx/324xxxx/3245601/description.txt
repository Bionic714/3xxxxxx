During World War II, Lieutenant Kelly learns of a German bank 
located behind enemy lines containing 16 million dollars in 
gold bars. His platoon, led by 'Big Joe', has three days of R&R 
coming, so, with the aid of hustler 'Crapgame', anachronistic 
hippie 'Oddball', three Sherman tanks and a touch of irreverence, 
Kelly leads his men deep into French territory to steal the 
gold for themselves.


This is for all of you World War II movie fans, a great 
World War II movie Starring Clint Eastwood.
