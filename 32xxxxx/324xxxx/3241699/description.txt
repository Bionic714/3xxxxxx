There's not much you can say about this album except that it's phenomenally good. It's a concept album, co-written by Emmylou and her then husband Paul Kennerley, and focusing on the life of a singer of Sioux descent named Sally Rose. 
The most striking thing about the album is that despite its conceptual nature, it really is at the same time a true country album, but accessible to pop fans who may choose to dabble in country from time to time. There are old-fashioned ballads and uptempo rockers - something for everybody here. Lyrically, the album is magnificent - just read the lyrics, which are included. Musically, the production is perfect, and Emmylou sounds about as good as she has ever sounded, before or since. 'Woman Walk The Line' is probably the best known song, as it has been covered by Trisha Yearwood, but really the original here is by far the better option. 'Timberline' is also magificently structured.

If you like country even slightly, this is a very safe bet, and a wonderful album with which to drive 100 miles.
