Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005

CD1:44x15mb CD2:21x15MB - 10/10/04


Not really sure whats new but when I installed it, it
was a LOT faster than regular WinXP. Has a lot of extra things
like Windows Plus does. Try it out if you are interested. This
comes with SP2 already in it and NO it is not homemade. Install
it and see for youself.


Nukers: Microsoft.Windows.XP.Media.Center.Edition.Proper-FTSiSo
is MCE 2004, not 2005.



Use one of the following serials during install:

Once Windows is installed, run the crack.exe inside of the /CRACK
dir on CD1 to get rid of the 60 day activation.

Enjoy :)
