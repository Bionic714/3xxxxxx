Programme 7: Ridicule Is Nothing To Be Scared Of

The fashion of punk was more important than the music according to some. The episode looks at Sex and Acme Attractions, the two leading shops competing with each other on the Kings Road, and the effect they had influencing punk clones across the country. This episode also looks at the importance of the punk picture sleeve and how the diy graphic designs of the time are admired today.

Programme 8: Punx Not Dead

We look at some of the bands that were sniffed at by the punk elders for being cartoon-like; bands like Charlie Harper's UK Subs, Sham 69, The Ruts, The Jam - but who dominated the late '70s charts, as well as the different routes bands took as punk began to splinter.
