Trail Of Dead CD On Hold Until Next Year 

The second-full length album from Texas-based rock act ...And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead has been pushed from its planned Oct. 5 release date to January, according to a post from group member Conrad Keely on TrailOfDead.org. Keely attributes the change to Interscope's crowded schedule of high-profile fall releases from U2, No Doubt and Eminem. &quot;They don't want to have to dust ours under the rug,&quot; he says.
