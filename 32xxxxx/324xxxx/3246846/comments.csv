,gurudev1000,2009-07-20T13:26Z,OK. Somewhere in Mininova it is mentioned that this is English subtitles hard coded. I will get this.
,Netot12345,2010-02-11T13:02Z,"Video: 640x360 23.98fps
Audio: MP3 stereo 77Kbps

Spoken language: Japanese
Subs: hardcoded english

imo, really strange movie. It is admittedly very good quality (Takeshi Kitano being director shows) but it is also really, really, full of clichĂŠs to the point of being very painful and boring to watch. And also has multiple references to the Japanese culture i couldnt understand. As i dont watch anime. (lol j/k)"
,MongKP,2011-12-19T10:30Z,Thank you for your sharing. I saw this movie on TV four years ago. So amazing that this torrent was uploaded seven years ago and still have people seeding it. I give +1 for this.
