Three stories of undying love from acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Takeshi Kitano. Bound by a long red cord, a young couple wanders in search of something they have forgotten. An aging yakuza returns to the park where he used to meet his long-lost girlfriend. A disfigured pop star confronts the phenomenal devotion of her biggest fan ... Three stories delicately intertwined by the beauty of sadness.
