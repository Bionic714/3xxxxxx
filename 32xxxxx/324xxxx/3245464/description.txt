The main reason of most PC problems is: low memory and Windows resources. Memory is most crucial in computer speed and stability. Unfortunately, there are problems with memory management in Windows. Many of today's shareware/freeware are poor written applications that leave some amount of memory allocated, even if it is not needed any more. Unfortunately, memory management in Windows cannot detect these errors.Another problem, many programmers use large libraries (DLLs) only to make their programs look nice. They never thought that some of these libraries are very large and consume a notable amount of memory, even if the program doesn't really need it. This will make your computer sluggish or unstable, you have to restart Windows frequently due to crashes and lock ups.MemMonster works to make your Windows does some memory trash collection, unloads any unnecessary dll, and moves current applications out to the swap file.
