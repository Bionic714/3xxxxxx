Don't buy into his fear mongering."
,guafr78,2008-12-24T21:13Z,"It is true, look at ""The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis"" by Bill Moyers, and look at ""The Corporation"" also take a look at ""America: From Freedom to Fascism"" and you will star to understand."

,spopes232,2012-07-29T03:49Z,"The problem isn't with Bush, with Moore, with anybody in particular. Obama is just the new symbol set upon the pile of blood and bones that we call America. We look at Nazi Germany, China, Russia as the evils as our time but we all carry evil equally in ourselves! The United States, with its bolstering of capitalism, which is a nihilistic ideology that attempts to create something out of nothing, has become an epicenter of this evil! Buying into the political agenda, the medical industry, or anything that has any connection with world commerce on any level is just a way of laying down, face up, mouth open, so that rich assholes can shit down your throat. Any way to beat the system is a step toward your betterment. Never believe anything anyone says, take in information and decide as well as you can by merit of your own critical thinking. "
