The ElectroMechanical ReFill, a collection of multisamples, patches and song files designed to bring the sound of those hard-to-find, easy-to-love vintage keyboards into your Reason rack. Our main focus when creating this ReFill has been on realism; the keyboards used were carefully recorded using both vintage and state-of-the-art equipment, but rather than trying to make these old beasts sound squeaky-clean and sonically perfect, we have embraced the flaws, quirks and errors that make up their very soul.
