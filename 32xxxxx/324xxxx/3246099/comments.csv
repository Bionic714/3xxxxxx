,zhixiong,2005-01-10T12:04Z,"From the same director that made the hit romance/comedy movie in 2001, My Sassy Girl.

The Classic is not as good as My Sassy Girl maybe because this movie is drama/romance.. not comedy/romance like My Sassy Girl.

Anyway, the music is great. Go get the OST if you can."
