,dvb,2005-03-05T22:19Z,"Fantastic video, and thanks for the super torrent, but I wish you had put the weblink and the ""ripped by"" notes over the copyright warning or something--anything but over the film itself.  The way you handled it is a bit like talking about yourself briefly during an mp3 file.  Just something to keep in mind next time around?  But seriously, THANKS for the torrent!  "
