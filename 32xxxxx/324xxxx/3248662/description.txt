Alright here one for the lovers of flower pot hats, yes its Devo The Men Who Make Music video 1979. This has been out of print forever, so i thought i would share it with everybody. This is ripped from the original VHS and is the usual HQ, enjoy!

Devo The Men Who Make Music video 1979 SVCD 50 minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

p.s. I also put the video cover in as well as the Newtown Neurotics and Slaughter And The Dogs because i forgot to post them with the videos.

Enjoy bandit999
