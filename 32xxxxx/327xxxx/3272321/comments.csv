,guitarsam,2005-07-12T23:13Z,"It would be nice if the 3 parts to this torrent were in the right order and didn't have sections truncated.  When you play part 1, you find that it's really part 2, when you play part two, it's in the middle of a lesson and you miss who knows how much of it.  Part 3 is the same as two.  I just deleted the whole thing from my computer."
