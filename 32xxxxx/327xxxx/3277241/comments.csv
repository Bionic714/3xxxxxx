,93Makaveli,2009-03-28T17:45Z,No guitars are included WTF?
,isoriper,2009-04-22T09:06Z,Works! Thank you sir! Great Torrent!
,jahsjdkajsh,2009-12-25T15:25Z,"I Probably get the same error as Technojedi. My cubase sx3 crashes as soon as real guitar loads. If I remove the realguitar.dll file in C:\Program Files\VstPlugins my cubase starts up as usual but otherwise I can't get it running at all. Im using vista. 

The program works just fine if it isn't connected to cubase so I gues it only a problem that appears with cubase?

If someone ever figure out any solution to this, please let me know! I have tried to run the program as admistrator and some other basic stuff, but cubase still crash."

,Thorspower14,2012-06-14T16:36Z,"WORKING on FL8, win7.

When the vst loads, there is no sound, that's normal. You will have to LOAD samples from the black section in the middle of the plugin.

Thanks for this great torrent, enjoy !"
