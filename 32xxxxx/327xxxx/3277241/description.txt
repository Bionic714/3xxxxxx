If  you  are serious about creating truly realistic sounding solo 
         and  accompaniment  guitar  stuff for your songs, our new product 
         called  RealGuitar  is  just  what  you  need.  RealGuitar  is  a 
         sample-based  virtual  instrument  with an innovative approach to 
         guitar  sound  modeling  and  guitar part performing on keyboard. 
                   
                   
         The  true  power  of  RealGuitar lies in 3 brand new technologies 
         incorporated   in   this   innovative  guitar  performance  tool: 
                   
                   
         New  multi-channel  layering  technology,  incorporating a custom 
         library  of  specially  recorded samples taken from every fret of 
         all  6  strings  of  a  real  guitar.  The  unique  Floating Fret 
         Position  technology, which imitates change of fret position of a 
         guitarist's  hand  on the neck. This gives you the possibility of 
         playing  on  up  to  104  guitar  frets  using  just 43 keys of a 
         standard  keyboard!  Our original Guitar Touch technology letting 
         you  easily imitate basic guitar techniques (strumming, plucking, 
         sliding,  bending,  muting,  etc..), using standard MIDI keyboard 
         and  MIDI  controllers,  such  as Pitch Bender, Modulation Wheel, 
         Sustain Pedal, Aftertouch. 
                   
         These  technologies  allow  to  closely emulate live guitar sound 
         and  techniques,  letting  you  perform guitar parts with a whole 
         new  level  of  realistic  expression.  Furthermore  they made it 
         possible  to  get  that  special  recognizable  sound  of  a real 
         12-string  guitar  using  samples taken from an ordinary 6 string 
         guitar,  as  well  as  to  achieve  true  Doubling (double track) 
         effect.   
                   
         RealGuitar  allows  to  use  rhythm  patterns  from  MIDI Pattern 
         Library  for easily creating guitar accompaniment tracks. All you 
         have  to  do  is  to  copy rhythm pattern to the needed number of 
         measures,  start  your  sequencer  and  use MIDI keyboard to play 
         chord  changes,  or  alternatively add chords to a MIDI track via 
         sequencer's editor.
