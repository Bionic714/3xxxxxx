,chefren,2005-01-02T01:26Z,"I get so fucking tired of these leechers thats all to common here. A whole bunch has compeleted dl and closes the very fucking second the torrent reaches 100%. Been a long time since i uploaded quality here, just remebered why. Probably wont be more from me in a long while  :/

It's not that hard to keep a torrent open, you just have to not close it. Even an idiot could manage that. "
