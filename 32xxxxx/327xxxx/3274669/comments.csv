,drrtypunk,2005-08-05T04:35Z,why not encode it in mp3 like every other album out there? i went to the website you have listed and right by the windows installer it says its being reported by windows as a trojan. sounds too dodgy just for 1 album
,r채ddflicka,2005-08-17T02:01Z,"There's nothing dodgy about flac or that website. I'm not that good around computers, but their software to decode flac into wav is excellent, and *very* easy to use. 

Like flaccube says at the very beginning, flac/wav is not lossy like mp3's are. Mp3's are *compressed*, and when things are compressed, things get lost! Notice that a flac-file is much larger than an mp3-file. I'm not that much of an audio purist that I can't enjoy mp3s for what they are, but, if you care the least about good audio... And if you wanna play this in your ipod, there's free software available to code flac/wav into mp3. :-)"

I'll check it now and then, and see if I can down-prioritize some other things.. thx so much for the Upload !!"
