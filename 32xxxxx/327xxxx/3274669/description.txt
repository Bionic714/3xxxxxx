I recently decided to stop seeding this and all other albums due to the fact that Piratebay users simply don't seed or care about ratios at all. I will make another try in maybe a month from now at best with a new album. I'm sorry, but the only one you can blame is probably yourself.





Today I seed the sixth out of 7 (9 albums, fixed 2 more) Depeche Mode albums I currently have as Flac. For the upcoming week there'll be one new Depeche album every day. So stay tuned =)

Note that FLAC is NOT a lossy format such as Mp3s which might injur your HiFi equipment badly. FLAC is nothing but the best and without all the DRM enabled crap Apple and Microsoft push out these days.

If you don't know about FLAC or why it is the future, head over to http://flac.sf.net and get convinced yourself.

AMG Review by Ned Raggett

In a word, stunning. Perhaps an odd word to use given that Violator continued in the general vein of the previous two studio efforts by Depeche Mode: Gore's upfront lyrical emotional extremism and knack for a catchy hook filtered through Wilder's ear for perfect arrangements, ably assisted by top English producer Flood. Yet the idea that this record would both dominate worldwide charts, while song for song being simply the best, most consistent effort yet from the band could only have been the wildest fantasy before its release. The opening two singles from the album, however, signaled something was up. First was "Personal Jesus," at once perversely simplistic, with a stiff, arcane funk/hip-hop beat and basic blues guitar chords, and tremendous, thanks to sharp production touches and Gahan's echoed, snaky vocals. Then "Enjoy the Silence," a nothing-else-remains-but-us ballad pumped up into a huge, dramatic romance/dance number, commanding in its mock orchestral/choir scope. Follow-up single "Policy of Truth" did just fine as well, a low-key Motown funk number for the modern day with a sharp love/hate lyric to boot. To top it all off, the album itself scored on song after song, from the shuffling beat of "Sweetest Perfection" (well sung by Gore) and the ethereal "Waiting for the Night" to the guilt-ridden and loving it "Halo," building into a string-swept pounder. "Clean" wraps up Violator on an eerie note, all ominous bass notes and odd atmospherics carrying the song. Goth without ever being stupidly hammy, synth without sounding like the clinical stereotype of synth music, rock without ever sounding like a "rock" band, Depeche here reached astounding heights indeed.
