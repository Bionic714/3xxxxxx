You can select the files you want to DL if you use a good torrent-app."

,rug,2005-07-14T09:15Z,"Whoever 'remastered' these albums needs to die...

wtf were u thinking?"
,Morphen,2005-07-14T11:59Z,why die ?
,Webzter,2005-07-17T17:36Z,"Mister Mustaine remastered these albums. And you wouldn't want him to die, would you? He didn't have anything to do while he was recovering his arm. So he decided to remaster all his previous albums... Can't blame the man for being bored..."
,rug,2005-07-20T05:52Z,"After what he did to 'so far...', yes he should die.

U dont have to agree, it's just my opinion."
