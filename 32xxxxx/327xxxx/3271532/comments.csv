,MrPendanski,2005-01-18T15:41Z,"är det ettan eller??? nån som vet nått om 2:an, dom la ju ner det men d kanske finns nån beta lr nått....demo.... det äger ju i allafall!!!!!!"
,Tablettask,2005-01-29T15:58Z,Dom skulle ju släppa uppfäljare till gammla klassiker när de fyllde 10 eller 20 år måste det va... men la de ner Full Throttle 2? :( hoppas inte det...
,Basseman,2005-02-05T15:02Z,tvåan finns
,polkis,2005-03-06T14:56Z,"Nej, tvåan finns inte..."
,Gizmo4u2,2005-05-19T02:45Z,tvån finns.... ni måste vara hjärndöda om ni säger att tvån inte finns... :)
,PiDuT,2005-07-27T12:50Z,"tvåan finns inte
inte som äventyrsspel iaf, kolla på Lucas Arts CLassic sida så få du se"
,kuremyr,2005-08-17T18:18Z,"This is the deal..

Tvåan var under utveckling, det kom till och med en rullande demo, men LucasArts beslöt att lägga ner produktionen då de inte ville göra alla Full Throttle fans besvikna, det var väl aningen annorlunda från orginalet."
,fnyzzel,2006-01-26T02:48Z,"kuremyr: Jag misstänker väl då att de snarare hade räknat ut att de skulle förlora mindre pengar på att lägga ned produktionen än att fortsätta den, snarare än att de tänkte på sina kära fans. Men annars stämmer vad du skrev. :)"
,dharcha1,2006-08-01T04:12Z,"someone please seed!!!
thanks so much!!!"
,MeatPopsicle,2006-12-07T23:09Z,Thanks alot! I remember this game from so many years ago when i had my 1st Mac. Oh the nostalgia! ^_^
,1wesa,2007-01-24T17:21Z,Hm..varför står det unknown format or damaged när jag ska unzippa? kanske ska ha en annan typ av program för att öppna den?
,Belleaux,2007-06-09T23:22Z,THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Works perfectly with Windows XP Media edition.  I tried other torrents but kept getting a blank black screen after mounting the image and clicking on the instal exe.  This is simple to use with scummVm. Great install instructions. A+++
,Ashuram,2007-06-26T02:02Z,"YES!! Thank you so much!
I own this game original but have been unable to play it since Mac went osX. 

The SCUMM app runs like clockwork...
played the game through in just over half an hour... I found myself smiling from start to end, feeling warm and fuzzy inside from nostalgia. 

Thanks man! "
