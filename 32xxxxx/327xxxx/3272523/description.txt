Biographers of Norman Cook should look no further than the title of this--his second album under the pseudonym Fatboy Slim. From Humble beginnings as the bass player in prole rock band The Housemartins, through chart-topping fame with Beats International, and even a spell scraping a meagre living from writing computer game soundtracks in the early 90s, Norman Cook has done it all. You've Come A Long Way, Baby, though, is the Fatboy's culmination; the quintessential, and utterly essential big-beat album. It's seldom poetry, but dumb dance music doesn't get much better.<br />
