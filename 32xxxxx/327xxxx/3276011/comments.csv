,jaybee276,2006-05-26T14:32Z,"It is a COMPLETE waste of time to put a file like this up for download. If it does not have the crack embedded in the file in a Readme or whatever. Never, Never, Never go to a Crack site. You are asking for trouble if you do.

If you want Respect, load in the crack with the file.


Jaybee said that!!!"
