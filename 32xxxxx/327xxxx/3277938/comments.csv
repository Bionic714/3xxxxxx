,orione,2005-01-17T14:03Z,"Thanks !  No, It is not Criterium, it is a copy of the movie re-edited and restored with the assistance and approval of Jean Renoir for Les Grand Films Classiques.
The audio part has beed restored too.  The translation is pretty good. Enjoy :-)"

Torrents get quickly lost on such a huge tracker as this one, so its nice to have a place where you can get a quick overview of the quality releases here (no Hollywood flicks of course...). And that goes for everyone else who wants to contribute something. [CiN] is our tag."
