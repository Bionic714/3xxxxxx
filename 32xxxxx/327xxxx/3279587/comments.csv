,Rootsman,2005-02-03T11:07Z,"This is one of the worst attempt of milking more cash out of bob marley (except for the ""chant down babylon"" cd). Totally un-erie. I like Bill Laswell's dub music, but this is a just awfull."
,Yush,2005-02-03T15:57Z,"I wouldn't call it ""milking"" money out of Marley. I mean - it's quite a limited crowd who's going to buy this album - not everybody likes Ambient music. However, I feel it's very well mixes album!"
,Rootsman,2005-02-12T22:58Z,i love ambient music & mostly listen to chillout/downtempo when i don't listen to reggae. There's somethings you just shouldn't out of respect and remixing bob marley is one of them.
