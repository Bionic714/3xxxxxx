Stuck at 99.6%..."
,Kifart,2005-07-07T20:30Z,For those who're stuck on 99.6% like me.... The first file can be fixed with DivFix (search google for it)... as for the second one..still looking for something...
,Kifart,2005-07-07T21:02Z,"Eum... the second uncompleted file can be fixed with first reconstructing it with VirualDubMod and the file that results with DivFix because keyframes get screwed up, but in the end you get the whole movie with only like 20 seconds missing here and there."
