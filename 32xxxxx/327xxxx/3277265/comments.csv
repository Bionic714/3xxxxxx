,hazylazy,2007-06-12T18:39Z,"Thank you, Dr Pepper, for your nice language. I am sure that you can do better yourself, than the ""fucking morron"" did - by the way, learn to spell English properly.

I'm sick of all complaining re. quality etc. Those of you that don't like the stuff, fix something better yourselves!"

,wrd5cnc,2012-01-17T16:47Z,"video is a tv rip of what appears to be almost VHS clarity. very small resolution too.
i sure wish i could get my hands on a DVD quality season 9"
,NCC86,2012-07-19T22:45Z,"Don't bother with this download. I don't know how it comes out at 5.09GB because it looks like old VHS video tapes. In fact, that's exactly what it is, you can see the little ""TVPG"" thing at the beginning and there is static in the middle where they skip commercials. Fucking embarrassing quality."
