I'm *am* seeding and there are several peers, but Pirate Bay seems to ignore that fact at the moment."
,BagronkeN,2005-01-13T08:21Z,"Please ignore the ""I'm am"".

I *am* very tired and I havn't slept for several hours, and my brain can't seem to ignore that fact at the moment.

=OP"

,Faker,2005-01-14T16:06Z,"The subtitles doesn't work for me... what am I doing wrong?! I'm using vlc-mediaplayer... and trying to play the moviefile and the ""subfile"" at the same time... doesn't work..."
,BagronkeN,2005-01-14T16:39Z,"Faker: I don't know about vlc-player as I only use MPC, but if you have VobSub installed it should display it automatically."
,BentleyB,2005-01-31T19:47Z,"Thanks man, excellent torrent."
,DohnJoe,2005-02-09T01:25Z,"Faker: Im using VLC to, this player doesn't use any kind of vobsub or codecs or other unnecessary sh:t. You must name the files excactly with the same name (not the file ending of course) and only use small letters, then start the movie file after that, then in the program on the top menu go to: video/subtitles/track1, this should work I hope. Good Luck "

,lhlavine,2008-09-03T18:55Z,I ignored the 0 seeders. You're wrong no one is seeding. Why don't you!!!
,lhlavine,2008-09-03T18:58Z,"BagronkeN - You are wrong - the 0-0 stats are correct. If you're so confident then seed yourself for others not as fortunate as you. SEED, SEED, SEED!!! I KNOW YOU HAVE IT. HELP US LESS LUCKY!!!"
,lhlavine,2008-09-03T22:10Z,"BagronkeN - You're a JOKE - I'm getting next to nothing. If you're for real, then be decent and really SEED!!!"
