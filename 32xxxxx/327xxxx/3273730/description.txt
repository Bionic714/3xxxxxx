Uncle Adolf, a dramatic film for ITV, tells the story of Hitler’s obsessive relationship with his niece Geli Raubel, which eventually led to the girl’s suicide - and how Eva Braun went on to become his wife.
Written by Nigel Williams (the award winning Dirty Tricks, and Bertie and Elizabeth), Uncle Adolf begins in 1929 as the Nazis rise to power in Germany, beginning the racist and expansionist policies that will propel Europe towards World War Two. The drama is intercut throughout with scenes depicting the Führer’s final days in 1945.
As his plans to turn Germany into a ‘pure’ nation develop, Hitler forms a warm yet dysfunctional relationship with Geli, 19 years his junior, lavishing her with gifts and attention. But the dictator’s attempt to control and manipulate those closest to him, as well as his country, leads to tragedy.
Filmed on location in Lithuania, Uncle Adolf recreates 1930s Munich, including Hitler’s luxurious flat and the Brown House Nazi HQ and the 1945 Berlin bunker where he and his devoted followers, including Eva, meet their deaths.
