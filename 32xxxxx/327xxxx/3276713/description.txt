Mink is a cute little dragon halfling (half human/half dragon) who has the unfortunate luck to fall in love with a famous handsome idol singer (you know the type). Unfortunate, because he is also a famous dragon hunter who would like nothing better to put Mink's head on a wall. Her main goal is to find a potion that will make her completely human and will do just about anything that will give her a chance at it. High in slapstick humor and action, this series follows Mink as she pursues that potion and is pursued in turn by the dragon hunter.
