And here is MY review of the film:

This is a documentary from Alex Jones about many different issues, but first and foremost about why you should always be critical of what you are told about the world, regardless of your feelings.

Bare in mind that you don´t need to agree with everything presented in this film in order to accept some of it, or at least gain an interest of some issues.
What I like about this film in particular is that it quickly mentions so many key issues of which there have been made entire films about; thus showing the magnitude of it all, and encouraging further scrutiny.

You should watch this...

But you shouldn´t either swallow it all raw or plainly dismiss it all. Then you would be unfaithful to truth and extremely selfish and immoral, either way you put it.  You should rather check these things out for yourself and seek the truth regardless of your own illusions and self-interest.

Good luck
