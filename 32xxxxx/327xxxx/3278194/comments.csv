,spas,2005-02-11T23:53Z,"I gonna download this for the fun.. But I starting to get tired of this..conspiracy teories..I rather enjoy my life doing what I like, then get hooked on shit like this.
But maybe i just dont give a shit."
,rec,2005-02-17T22:16Z,"Gunlaug, check out the link I posted earlier. There you´ll probably find more Alex Jones stuff.

Use VLC to play the movies you download."
,Luftmjuk,2005-02-26T16:36Z,"Yeah, that link was really good, the torrent one! You can find the latest reports from 2005 by Alex Jones and lots lots more. Beware that all conspiracy reserachers are not good though. Some of them are just nuts.

But dont belive for a second that the world isnt run by a handfull of people. It is. Its provable and if you dont belive it you just havent been presented with the good material that is out there yet. 

Alex is really good, but remember that you dont have to like everything he says, he is just human and has his own opinions like everyone does."
,ndrc,2008-04-07T03:41Z,can someone just seed it ? please????
,JCalvin,2008-11-28T16:05Z,"Yes, please seed. I just started downloading it, and there are no seeders, so if you don't start downloading it, I'll never get it. This is to replace the crappy (small file) version I already have."
