,Jahakob,2005-08-04T12:08Z,"Uploading at 100kbs and downloading at 10kbs...

I guess this is the worst game in the series, from what I've heard.
Played F1 and F2 for a long time and finished them many times as well.
From what I've heard and read this game is more about killing and tactics, which also was an element in the fallout series but not the key element.
I'll give a statement as soon I have DLed it... ;P"

,Humle1981,2007-05-08T02:35Z,"Premo69>>

First off this is no longer a swedish site... it used to be back in 2005 till they made it a ""world wide"" site, but in regards to laws around the torrent this site is ""swedish"", cause laws in sweden (scandinavia in total) er bendable around the sharing issue.

works for me :p
But a explanation on the swedish site issue.
this is a international site now :p

on a site note... im fine with swedish since im Danish.. so it dosnt bother me if peeps type swedish."

,Davidow,2011-07-19T10:45Z,"""Can't install Fallout Tactics / Installer won't run""

I had the same problem as many others - that the installer would not run after klicking on it, nomatter if you accessed it by browsing the CD or by using the autoloader. You can see that an ""installer"" is running in your system processes, but nothing happens. 
I almost gave up, but when I left the CD loaded in Deamon Tools and then rebooted my PC.
When my comp had booted again, the autoloader automatically and when clicking on the ""install Fallout Tactics""-option, the installer suddenly worked!
I can't guarantee that this will work, but I have not found any other way on the internet to make it work.

TLDR:
1. Download 
2. Leave the CD mounted in Deamontools/120% alcohol and make sure it will load when windows have booted up.
3.Install!"

,NecroFile,2012-06-24T12:26Z,"Setup.exe runs, but only so far as executing the process; it doesn't actually pop-up with the installer to actually install the game.

Compatibility issue, maybe? This is on Windows 7."
