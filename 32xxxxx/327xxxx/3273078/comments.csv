,giggedyguy,2008-08-15T06:18Z,Saw that you're an admin can you kick Loder off this site. He's be consistently uploading untest torrents that are unplayable or incompatible with any player known to man. I've got a rockin system with all the codecs. He doesn't even  seed a lot of his stuff. He just uploads to up his credits on this site. That spells PARASITE!
,Hejjhejj,2008-08-28T22:30Z,"@giggedyguy

maybe you got too many codecs then? you should only get the ones you really need. too many codecs usually equals shit. no offence, lol. i dunno how it is, just felt like writing... im tired...zzzzzz....bed!"
,Taikeri,2008-09-13T19:39Z,"Heh, or then you could move to VLC.
No need for pissy codecs."
