However there's a useful 'info' file that may help to install another Norton AV 2005 torrent - Many come without such crucial information.  These are the instructions: 

-- DISABLE YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION! --
-- Do NOT enable until install done! --
Install and use KeyGen to generate a Product Key.
Go to product activation and select - activate now, skip
registration - it will complain that it can't connect to
the symantec servers..... press next until you reach the
retry screen & select activate my software by phone. Use keygen once more to get your final unlock code!
Restart once more. Now done. Enable Internet connection, run liveupdate (may have to repeat LU 2-4 times!)"
