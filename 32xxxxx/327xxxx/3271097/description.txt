A scene from a 60s Spaghetti Western? Yes, but it's also available for the PC. In LucasArts Entertainment Company's Outlaws, you are the embodiment of the loner who rides into town seeking vengeance and uncovers the twisted plot of a powerful railroad baron and his outlaw thugs. Outlaws is a hybrid of strategic action-adventure and network play in an environment so immersive and intense, you can smell the gunpowder of a Colt .45 and hear the tinkling keys of a saloon piano.

This is one of my favorite games, partially because it's western! And Spaghetti westerns are just that damn cool. Also, it has one of the greatest game soundtracks since Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen (the original). A Must-Have in your Lucasarts game collection.

And actually I don't have this game on my PC yet, but I found it on torrentspy and it's using the prq tracker so I thought why the hell isn't it listed ^^
