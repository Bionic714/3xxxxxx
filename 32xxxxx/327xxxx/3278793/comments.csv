Those worked for me, but they lost sync towards the end. But that was probably because I was watching a movie that was only 93.4% done. If anyone has this please seed."

,Placement93,2009-05-03T19:14Z,"I have the whole file and am seeding after at least two months of 93.4%.  My connection sucks, so don't expect a mb/sec, but it's all here.  Also, I'd be glad to work on putting subtitles to it (it would be a good exercise for my German) if someone would tell me what program I need, etc.  93."
