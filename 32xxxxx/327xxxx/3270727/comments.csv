,teenagefreedomfighter,2008-05-26T07:09Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS! 

Kazaa installs a program called instafinder, which as it describes itself in innocent enough. It claims to simply give you a result page when you type an incorrect url. The truth is that this is ad-ware, and you will get random pop-ups usually a few weeks after installing it. Many people also claim that it or threw it you can get keyloggers and such. This program id difficult the remove, by spybot usually does the trick (after a few tries).

Sorry to the uploader, this has nothing to do with you. I am not claiming that this upper has modified these files in any way to effect your computer. The fact is that kazaa is packed full of ad-ware including instafinder."
