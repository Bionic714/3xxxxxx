,Groottenn,2010-05-19T12:03Z,"Hello.
This file is broken. Videolan reports that, and Media Player Classic takes 20-30 seconds to buffer the data before play it.
You still can watch and enjoy the video, but can't seek.
I'm not complaining, just reporting.
It's a fucking great video and i enjoyed it very much, they sound powerful.
Thanks very much for sharing this rare material !!

For those interested :
Video: DivX 5, 352x240, 29.97fps. 
Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 3, 44100Hz, stereo, 128kbps."
,Groottenn,2010-05-19T12:09Z,"I forgot :
Play it LOUD !!!
Awesome setlist."
