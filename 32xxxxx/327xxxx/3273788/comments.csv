,PirrePrivat,2005-01-06T17:43Z,Hej... Filen heter CD_Image_File_CD1... Är detta hela filmen eller bara den första av flera?
,CassiusClay,2005-01-06T18:12Z,Ingen som seedar hela filen eller ? 
,combat90,2005-01-06T20:43Z,"Shiit, datorn måste ha lagt av. Fortsätter seeda så fort jag kommer hem ti den"
,combat90,2005-01-06T20:44Z,Det är hela dokumentären. Ca 1h03m
,gggggg,2005-01-07T00:18Z,Kvalitén är som vcd ungefär. Filmen har holländska subs som inte går att ta bort.
,empa1,2005-03-07T20:32Z,"Den e ju för fan textad på HOLLÄNDSKA!!!!
men annars var den helt okej;)"
,Werm,2005-04-14T03:55Z,"Don't be fooled into thinking this has much to do about DaVinci. Only about 12-15 minutes is devoted to his art. 
However, it is still an interesting film if you're into theology. 

The breakdown looks like this:

1. Patrick Macnee Intro
2. Renaissance Clues
3. Priory of Sion
4. The Templar Knights
5. The Cathars
6. The Holy Grail
7. Berenger Sauniere
8. The Rosslyn Chapel
9. Christianity Through The Years
10. The New Testament
11. Closing

,tuningnutt,2006-05-24T07:46Z,"First of, all THANK YOU uploader. Second, I am doing my part and seeding; I am almost at the 1:1 ratio now. Third, I keep seeing seeders drop off on my client and makes it look like hit and runners. If it is screw you I hope your hard drive crashes. If not, good for you! Please seed for every body until it dries up. If no one helps me seed, I'll delete it from my p.c."
,tuningnutt,2006-05-24T18:44Z,"You all can go fuck yourselves for this torrent now. I am sick of seeding and I am the only one. Fuckin bastards. I watch my leechers go up and down, and my seeders stay for a tenth of a second and disappear. I will upload this to a private tracker where there is more respect. Sorry to those who MIGHT have seeded. Fuck the rest of you."
,BosnaMan,2006-05-27T22:35Z,"@combat90
Thanks for the good documentary dude,
I've enjoyed watching it. (Bedankt) :)


@tuningnutt
So you ain't gonna seed anymore..

21 users are seeding this torrent and they all
know that leechers do ""hit and run"" a lot.

Do you really think that if you do not seed 
anymore it will make a difference? tsk tsk..
No-one will notice if one out of 21 seeders stops.
No-one fucking cares about your seed.

Don't be childish, step into the real world where
not everyone is nice and helpfull. Grow up man."
,lq-w,2006-07-04T17:33Z,is this full version?
,hauler,2010-03-07T16:46Z,Pls SEED! Thx
