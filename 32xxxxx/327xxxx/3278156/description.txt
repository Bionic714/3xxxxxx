Asheville
DVD

DVD of the Asheville performance from 2000.  The video is from a tripod and the audio is from an audience source.  The overall quaility is on par with the NOLA 2001 DVDs.  In anycase much better quality than the 6/27/00 DVD.

The DVD is 3 discs.  I'm not sure if this was necessary or not, but either way IT INCLUDES DRUMS!!! Which was missing on the NOLA DVDs, and if you don't like drums, well, there's something seriously wrong with you!!!

One flaw, is that during Drums and Bass something doesn't seem to sync up, but it gets corrected.

This is 11 gigs, but we've got one hell an upload, especially at night, so it will not take long!!! :)

Coverart is included.

IF....IF everybody helps to seed back, look for the entire 2001 Greek run to be seeded next!

ENJOY!
