,dudkake,2005-01-19T16:21Z,How's the quality and overall ripping/encoding job do you guys think...?
,trashstar,2005-01-20T20:44Z,"first of all, THNX! 
even forgot that i wanted to see this, but now i'll surely enjoy it.

about the rip: pic quality looks fine, but the aspect ratio seems a little off? 
and 666 is a really weird width, not even divisible by four? i think 640x368 might've been a better choice?

i guess the subs (http://img104.exs.cx/img104/3786/bscap00494en.jpg) are a matter of taste, but they do steal quite a lot of the image. maybe just a white outline around the font next time.

just my $0.02. 
nice to see new rippers, n once again, thanx."

All over good feedback which I'll be sure to take with me...

As for the aspect ratio, you make a good point.

The subs is indeed a matter of taste. ;P"
