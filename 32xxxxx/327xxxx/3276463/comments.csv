,agent86,2005-01-14T14:24Z,"I don't mind stealing from big movie companies, but stealing from charities?
Liveaid proceeds go to help the less fortunate of this world. If you want this, have a heart and buy it. You get enough stuff for free, don't you?"
,modesty,2005-01-14T14:57Z,"I agree with agent86, don't download this, buy it instead.."
,Tyson,2005-01-14T15:15Z,I agree with you! It's really low (and sick actually) to upload AND download this one. Please buy this one instead if you want to see/listen to it! The money goes straight to charity! 
,suppeq,2005-01-14T15:57Z,"Sucker... Buy it!

And this goes for the 10 leechers too!"
,skinner735,2005-01-15T14:32Z,"Well I guess double standards is better than no standards.

Sure I may download tons of other movies, but choose not to download this one. Why? 
-All the artists do this for free, and donate every cent of the profits to charity. That's why.

Sure I may be hypocritical from your point of view, but at least I'm doing SOMETHING. What are you doing?"
,andii,2005-01-16T19:06Z,"2 arguments to why this is wrong:

1. by offering this to others that MIGHT have payed for it you are taking money from the already poor and starving. 

2. by downloading this (even if you never would have payed for it) you are symbolicly saying ""FUCK YOU"" to the cause AND the ppl that are suffering. 

by showing some selfcontrol and refusing to download this at least your showing some respect for the people suffering."

,Morleon,2005-01-19T21:36Z,"Jag har bara en liiiiiten fråga, vad hände med Live Aid DVD2? Jag såg den aldrig....kollat runt men hittar bara 1:an och 3:an....nån som har den på länk eller kan slänga upp den vänligen?"

,Shaffyre,2006-03-20T12:12Z,"I donate a big chunk of my relatively good income to various charities including Unicef, Amnesty Intl, PRAY Foundation and others. All who help the poor of the world. If I bought the Live Aid DVD's part of my money will go to the store, another part to the wholesaler, another to the DVD manufacturer, another to the distributers, another to the record companies and in the end there's little left for the poor. In general only about 5 to 6% of the price of a CD goes to the artist/s. For DVD's it's even less as a part also goes to the filming company. If u want to make a difference then donate money to 1 or more charities that help the poor in the world or go and help the people in Africa like I did. Well, I actually did both. Posting here urging people not to download the DVD's but to go buy it won't make one bit of a difference to the poor people of the world. Peace be with u and may God bless u!"
,Shaffyre,2006-03-20T12:13Z,"Oh, I almost forgot! Thank u very much psychopink for seeding the DVD's!"
