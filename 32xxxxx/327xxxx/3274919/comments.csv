,Oculon,2008-05-02T07:41Z,"Thanks for the torrent, Pippin. I actually used a search to find this particular Item---Now if I can find ""Smell the Glove,"" I'll be able to settle in for a few good chuckles.
As one who spent plenty of time on te road along with my well known ex; the first time we watched it, she asked me to turn it off half way through. She was afraid of busting a gut! After almost 20 years at the time) of playing clubs, composing, and touring (inckuding 1 world tour) the schtik was every thing that could happen to a touring band, happens in this movie.
I happen to remember the 60's and 70's atmosphere well!! I'm probably the only one here that would rate thisflick a 10+
Thanks again Pippin.
P.S. Thanks for snagging the great Bio from Amazon AND giving the proper credit! KUDOS!!"

,redholio,2009-04-20T17:39Z,Good quality no complaints other than the best part is missing. The film actually extends beyond that credits to reveal the funniest part. Unfortunately I didn't read the comment below and I have to be disappointed in myself.
