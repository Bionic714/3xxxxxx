,Bentis,2005-04-02T05:28Z,its ac3 smartass
,EmesiS,2005-05-10T08:01Z,"Well if it is AC3 then why is the volume level so low and the quality pretty lame. The video rip is good but the sound is not very good. Even my 11yo daughter asked what was wrong with the sound? Take a look at Black Label Society-Boozed, Broozed, & Broken Boned....now that is a good rip. The sound is full with good separation and no volume loss. Maybe Hilary would sound better if I burnt it to dvd....I am running it thru XBMC from my computer hard drive to my Xbox. I don't want to complain about a rip but I thought I would give my feedback in case someone else is getting the same results.....thanx
