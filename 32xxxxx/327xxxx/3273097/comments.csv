,Niffe,2005-01-05T23:37Z,"Du råkar inte ha Wong Kar-wai's ""helgon i neon"" liggande på datorn också?"
,sleazy,2005-01-06T12:17Z,"Truly appreciated upload! :D

Massive thanx! "
,BooYaa,2005-01-08T06:54Z,is this NTSC with english subtitles?
,sleazy,2005-01-10T01:19Z,"The file structure in this .iso is messed up :( 

I rearranged them and it works fine in my standalone player...

(found files in the root cataloge that belonged in VIDEO_TS folder)"
,Skellington,2005-01-20T15:03Z,"It's in PAL with swe subs only, sorry about the structure probs, I don't really don't know why (I've used DVD decrypter and Imgtool)"
,sleazy,2005-01-22T19:29Z,"Why Imgtool??

If it´s a single layered disc, just use DVDDecrypter with setting: 
Mode-->ISO-->Read
Then you end up with a .mds file and one .iso file :)"
