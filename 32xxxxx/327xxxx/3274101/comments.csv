,RoyKidman,2009-07-22T22:54Z,"Great torrent but some of these songs are not from the 80s

Sam Cooke - Wonderful World (1959)
AC/DC - T.N.T (1974)
AC/DC - Highway To Hell (1979)
Queen - We Will Rock You (1977)
Queen - We Are The Champions (1977)
Queen - The Show Must Go On (1991)

All those songs are still good but just pointing that out. Torrent still amazing."
