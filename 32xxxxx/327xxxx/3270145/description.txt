AKA Mr. Handy

 "Mr. Handy" holds the key to all your problems!

Top actress/singer Uhm Jung Hwa and rising new star Kim Joo Hyuck join forces in this new silver screen smash that aims to win your heart with witty dialogues & charming scenarios void of indecent remarks. Kim portrays Hong Doo Shik an all-round worker who shifts between different working places as frequently as other people change their clothes. He delivers goods with the same smile he wears while he makes performances at a live caf√©, in other words he does everything as long as he gets his pay. Everything could have continued that way until he bumps into the hyper- active Yoon Hye Jin (Uhm Jung Hwa) and immediately calls her the world's most troublesome woman. Yoon on the other hand complains that Hong gets on her nerves while performing his duties as "Mr. Handy". How then is it possible that these two opposed personalities still end up feeling attracted to the other party? Just let "Mr. Handy" resolve all your problems!
