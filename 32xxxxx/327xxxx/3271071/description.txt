PLOT:

must say! This is a good movie, with a corny ending like A.I, it 
started off as a thriller and ended up a Sci-fi although the 
connection was a perfect blend. The Director made good use of the 
gaps created by the story to fuse the two genre's together. Dominic 
West is a new comer to the big screen (playing only minor roles in
other movies) but his level of proffesionalism made him a wild card
in this movie and he delivered. Just like how "two smoking barrels 
made jason Statham a big Hollywood actor, hope to see him in more
movies. Julian Moore a veteran of the industry showed her dominance 
as always...much appreciated Julian. The only thing that didn't
really make sense was her husband not being there in end. The story
line should have taken them back before the abduction occurred so as
to make the ending a happier one...
