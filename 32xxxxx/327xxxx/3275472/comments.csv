,Vecna,2005-03-07T11:56Z,"WTF is this? This compilation totaly fooked up my computer. Is there a real virus in this package, cuz my norton complained about that in one of the folders.

Anyway, after 5 installations after it had gone to 100% and reboots I get to the windows logo, after that the screen is black... I mean the screen monitor turns itself off (no signal). I then reboot, go into safe mode and it installs all the extra programs, now it says that it will shutdown in 5 minutes... Ok fine, reboot and the same thing, windows logo and then its black.

Now I cant even install a previous copy of WinXP, not even run Drive image to restore my drives. I get a blue screen right before where you choose where to install windows OR when drive image is about to start...

This majorly fooked up my computer so I cant recommend that you try this.

Yes I tried fdisk/formated the drive, switched bios chip, reset cmos, you name it, I cant install shit on the comp now..."
,Vecna,2005-03-08T12:26Z,"ATTENTION!!!!

Do NOT burn this CD before you have removed 2 files from it, extract all the files to a folder of your choise and remove the 2 files I will specify.

""$OEM$$1InstallWinampKeygen.exe (Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Delf.fd)""

""$OEM$Retestrak ExtrasInternetMSM MessengerMSM Block Controllblockcontrol.exe (Backdoor.Win32.Optix.Pro.f)""

These two are probably the cause my computer crash, other than that this seem too be a good release. Forgive my previous comment cuz I was not in a good mood at that time. I think no one would be if you DL something that contains viruses"

,RahXephon,2005-03-25T21:06Z,"If I extract all the files to a specified folder and then just burn them after i have deleted those 2 files, (which my mcafee said were exactly what your norton said), wont that kill the auto boot sequence for my DOS pickup to install an os?"
,RahXephon,2005-03-27T10:50Z,"Do not use this release for an OS, it is unstable and gives mass amounts of blue screen dos error messages.

It is still worth the download juts for all the ripped programs in it but do not install it for an OS it doesnt work."
