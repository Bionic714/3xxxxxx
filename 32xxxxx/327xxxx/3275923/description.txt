'The follow-up to the classic debut album of the Scottish AOR band STRANGEWAYS was titled 'Native sons' and was released back in 1987. The band had changed their lead vocalist. The American session-vocalist TERRY BROCK was the new lead vocalist of a Scottish band. And this guy was sounding very much like STEVE PERRY of JOURNEY and also the music was very close to the classic JOURNEY AOR sound of albums like 'Frontiers' and 'Escape', but also like 'Raised on radio'.'

This is a rip of the original CD release, long out of print. The three first Strangeways albums were re-released in the late 90s by Hangdog Records, but these now seem to be out of print as well.

If anyone has Strangeways' first album (self-titled), please share.
