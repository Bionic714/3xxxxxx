              Ok Reason for Proper:
              MoF rls = 82.mins.missing
              Tsunami-Appeal rls = really.bad.quality.and.pixelated
              Well we have also added a vob sample from DiSc2 of our
              source DVD, for just the nukers who would think we 
              stole the source from Tsunami's DVDr but guess what
              we didnt, this is our own source, we lost race and
              this is proper to give the public a great quality rls
              they deserve!
