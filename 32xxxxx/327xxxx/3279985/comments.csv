This one you cant buy in Swedish stores and if u ask the store to import in it cost 44$! atleast.

I wished many times ""only I had a creditcard"".. so could buy it on internet for losy 6$ including shipping. But I dont have that :(
But then it proboly would got stuck in postal office and they would have given me taxes and some more taxes on that.

And now u give me this THANX! :) :D"
