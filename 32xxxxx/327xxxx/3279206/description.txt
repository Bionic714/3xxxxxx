Discworld Noir 

Ok, as far as we know:
Image1 is CD3
Image2 is CD2
Image3 is CD1
CD1.cue is pointing to image1
CD2 points to where it is supposed to
CD3.cue is also pointing to image1

So either change the names of image1 and image3 (in which case you also need to edit CD3.cue and have it pointing to image3 )
Or simply edit CD1.cue and have it point to image3, in which case at least the cue-files will represent the correct CD#.

And please seed some after you're finished downloading.
