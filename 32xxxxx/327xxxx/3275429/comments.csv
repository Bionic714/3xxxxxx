,Karolingiska,2005-01-12T03:24Z,They shoulda compared with an AMD processor instead. (If it's a matter of MAC vs. PC that is..)
,Mupp_Gonzo,2005-01-12T03:46Z,"Nah, this is against the Intel MHz myth. Mac/PC comparisons are more complex, including OS comparisons and so on. OSX and Linux on AMD platforms rules!"

The reason I brought it up is because people complain that the new Mac mini lacks in ""performance"" since it ""only"" has 1.25/1.42 GHz. Most people only count MHz :D"
