This torrent has like 27 of the language courses, so you should be able to DL just the ones you need..."

I have now for 2 days trying to get Rosetta Stone to work ? but cant get it up and running. 

I have downloaded the main program and installed it and it is working fine. 

But it can?t find the languages files that I have burned to a CD.

How do I do this? 

I want it to be on a CD only don?t want to mount the file on HD. 

Do anybody know if it is possible to make a CD that you just put in your PC and the it is working. (like when you buy the program in the shop) :o))

I have tried everything now, burned application with and without the languages files, burned the languages files alone, made an ISO file and burned it but nothing is working. I have also tried to name the CD with different names (don?t know if that is necessary or not?)

If anybody would be so kind to explain step by step (for dummies) how it can be done so it runs from a CD even my grandmother can use.

Thanks BOB"

,Jpearsall,2010-08-30T05:37Z,Give us the fucking instructions asshole
,wanda_5,2010-09-04T17:20Z,"@ LalaTorrent,
Thank you very much, works perfect.

@Jpearsall,
I wanted to make short instructions, but after I saw your perfect statement how retarded and ungrateful kid you are, I changed my mind."
