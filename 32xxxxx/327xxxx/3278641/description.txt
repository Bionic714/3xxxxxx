North Shore

North Shore is a lush drama that captures the passion, intrigue and heart of Hawaii. This 20-something ensemble series is set at the Grand Waimea, a luxury hotel, where Jason Matthews (Kristoffer Polaha, America's Prince: The John F. Kennedy Jr. Story) is the popular general manager and his ex-girlfriend Nicole Booth (Brooke Burns, Shallow Hal) is the newly hired head of guest relations, having left her father's hotel empire to make her own way in the business â€“ and in life. Working side by side causes much tension between them, but their romantic relationship may be far from over.
