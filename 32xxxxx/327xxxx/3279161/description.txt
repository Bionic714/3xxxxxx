AMG review:
Bubblegum is Mark Lanegan's sixth solo album, but still he's relatively unknown to all but a few. Since going solo, the former Screaming Trees frontman has attracted a cult following, but if a man can be judged by the stature of his friends, then surely Bubblegum marks the beginning of Lanegan's turn in the spotlight. Featuring such high-profile guests including PJ Harvey ("Hit the City" and "Come to Me"), Guns n'Roses / Velvet Revolver's Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan ("Strange Religion"), Afghan Whigs / Twilight Singers' frontman Greg Dulli ("Methamphetamine Blues") and Masters of Reality's Chris Goss (who shares production credits, as well as appearing on a number of songs), the songs on Bubblegum display a breadth of style that matches Lanegan's trademark depth of substance. And though he kept his profile comparatively low as a longterm collaborator with Queens of the Stone Age, his two bandmates Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri feature heavily throughout (Homme, in particular, plays guitar or drums on five of the tracks here). But this is by no means a QOTSA album. Bubblegum has a sound all its own, and Lanegan is firmly at the helm, with his gravelly voice and sombre observations making him sound more and more like Tom Waits. Its pleasures may not be immediate to all listeners, but once found, they're difficult to shake. --Robert Burrow
