,Rosebud,2005-01-15T22:13Z,"Strange, I cant get the subs to work.Tryed both in VLCplayer and on my XBOX but nothing shows up.

Does anyone get the subs to work?"

As far as the XBOX goes, I have no idea how to get the subtitles to work there, but Im sure there are ways to burn the subtitles into the image itself: will look into it."
