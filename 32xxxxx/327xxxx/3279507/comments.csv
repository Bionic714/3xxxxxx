,HuxteR,2005-02-14T19:15Z,Thank you very much! I just love Dylan in Black Books - I hope he is as good in this one ;)
,jackhughes,2005-06-13T20:43Z,"Hey, can you please upload the bill baily part troll torrent again? I'm stuck at 49%"
,Yoggie,2006-12-27T01:25Z,Will the Bill Bailey torrent ever be brought back?
,Cathfish,2007-02-17T00:56Z,"Oh, GOD!. I watched Dylan Moran on Swedish national television yesterday and I nearly wet my pants. He is so god damn good!
I like the part about the hairy bagpipe and his definition of French bohemians. :P"
,Khadul-Elis,2007-06-28T13:30Z,Finns det någon undertext till denna?
,KorainPewPewPew,2007-07-04T02:27Z,"För er som vill ha undertexter så håller jag precis på med att översätta en fransk undertext, som ska vara synkad efter den här versionen - annars får jag väl synka den. Det kan ta ett par dagar, eftersom jag inte kan franska utan måste lyssna på vad han säger, men så snart jag är klar, laddar jag upp den, eller skickar till de som vill ha. Stay tuned =)"
,iggy.stooge,2007-08-10T19:53Z,Jag vill mer än gärna ha den med undertexter så jag blir skitglad om du lägger upp den!!!
,serellie,2009-08-06T22:57Z,Is nobody commenting on quality? I downloaded it and thought the colour seemed washed out and the ratio was squished. Too bad. 
,arjay2277,2009-10-18T19:18Z,They start the day with chocolate bread!!!!
,geenotreally,2009-12-29T10:48Z,Thank You so much for this. You are about to make my day er.. week.
,egrodob,2010-01-01T13:56Z,"Dylan is amazing. When i've seen ""black books: for first time i was like ""oh my god"" and i was laughing for hours)))) 2nd show i've seen was ""like tottaly"" and its blowed my mind away. Absoluteley unbelievable and amazing job he done there. But i've never seen ""monster"" before and i hope its going to be as good as other shows are"
