I am getting the same problem as you. Does anyone have any ideas on what to do? Any suggestions would help."
,Gimpy-kun,2008-03-29T21:29Z,Sorry I solved it and the key works great I jsut wish it was like the board game Axis and Allies and not a RTS. Like how Risk is.
,DonPatch,2008-08-07T04:27Z,I hope this works on vista   and thank you even if it doesnt for listing it :)
,mannyfamicon,2009-04-11T21:00Z,"I extracted the keygen, but i cant open it. Does anyone have any idea what im doing wrong?"
,NephilimNexus,2009-06-11T11:09Z,"Game installs just fine, and the crack basically works, but alas - the keygen contains a virus.

So go ahead and use this torrent, but find a different keygen to finish the installation."
,banangert,2009-07-14T22:08Z,"seed, been waiting for this game forever and im currently downloading in 4kb/s!"

,vanera03,2011-07-23T01:40Z,Thank you for sharing this file. please seed..
,Bowen69,2012-04-05T16:55Z,"Thank you very much to the uploader and the very few seeders. Took ages to download, but was well worth the wait. Crack works perfectly!

Keycode that works is B2WS-6JGH-PV7G-PBKP as the keygen doesnt work...

Will be seeding from now on. "
,Bowen69,2012-04-05T17:03Z,"To anyone having trouble working out how to get this working. first get powerISO. Install that as per normal. Then right click the iso file named disk 1. click mount and then mount it to the drive. Go to my computer and run it (if it doesnt run, right click the cd on mycomputer and explore it. find the file called autorun and click that.) the game will now install. half way throught it will tell you to insert the other disk. use the windows key to come out of it. find the disk 2 ISO file and mount that like you did the first. then go back to the install and hit ok. it will then install. OK now its all installed you need to sort the crack. explore the disk 2 and find the crack folder. extract it using 7zip or something. inside theres a program called aa. now find the install folder, usually C:/program files/atari/axis&allies and replace the file called aa with the cracked one. now the game should run without the disk. the key code is B2WS-6JGH-PV7G-PBKP

NOW ENJOY!"
