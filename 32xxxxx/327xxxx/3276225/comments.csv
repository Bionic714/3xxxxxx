,sponken23,2005-01-14T13:15Z,Thanks!! This show deserves High Definition and 5.1 audio.
,sponken23,2005-01-14T13:19Z,Doesn't seem to work though. Is the torrent dead?
,sponken23,2005-01-14T13:24Z,"Hmm. Seems to be something wrong with the tracker at the moment.

Do you have the other 24 season 4 episodes as well in high definition?"
,Hypnosis,2005-01-14T13:51Z,"I have uploaded the torrents and seeding them, so hopfully they should become visable soon.."
