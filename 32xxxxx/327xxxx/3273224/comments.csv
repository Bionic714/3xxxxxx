,homeware,2007-08-01T04:35Z,"Guys don't get frustrated, I got it worked and this is really easy so you can be happy.
This is how to:
Go to the Manhunt folder that u've downloaded, then go to the ""rzr-man1"" folder.
Rename the file inside to ""rzr-man1.iso"".
Do as the same with the remaining two folders.
Now you'll need Daemon tools, or a similiar emulation software. Mount the first image. Start the installation. When it asks for the second disc, unmount the first, then mount the next and do as the same with the third aswell.
When you've installed the game, go to the folder ""Crack"" on the third disc. (From ""My Computer""), copy the exe file, now go to the installed manhunt's folder and Ctrl+V and overwrite.
Here we go. This worked for me. Have fun with it."

,CarmaTDR,2008-01-05T18:08Z,"Mount cd1 cd2 cd3 at same time 
install from cd1 setup  
otherwise use same letter if it don´t work 
use Alcohol120% or Deamon Tools choose 4 drive letters mounting
or any good other simulair emulation programs
u can also burn and create own image game movies etc with Alcohol120% 
that is the purpose burn cd and make image´s
=so no CD drive needed after all
afterward check if it´s any updates,patch,sheats avalible maybee after 4years and then replace  C:/Program/Rockstar/Manhunt/Manhunt.exe with Manhunt.exe (=crack) 
good luck Dude !!! 
the game was too hard for me I only made thru first 4 tapes meself and it´s only get worse

bin,iso,nrg,img.... = it´s exactly same files 
with different names (like mp3 mp4u) or (avi mpeg)
check your Alcohol120% or Deamon Tools settings so you just choose them all *.iso,*.nrg,*.img,*.bin, maybee *.rar also
then simple mount everything and install with cd1 setup and crack afterwards sucessfull install with any Manhunt.exe (=same crack)
I hope this info works 4u also with every avalible game torrrent in the future
I´m waiting at Manhunt 2 [pc] release meself "

more in key config as numb keys arrows

same thing with all avalible emulatorprogs Deamon Tools or whatever can do that
someone must have snapped his mind
mount & autostart cd 1 mount cd 2 then cd 3
use ""Manhunt.exe"" crack replace ...--> C:\Programs\Rockstar\Manhunt\Manhunt.exe 
then Start Game
