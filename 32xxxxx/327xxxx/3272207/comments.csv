,Szimen,2007-03-21T22:46Z,"EVERYBODY WHO WONDERS HOW TO PLAY DOWNLOADED GAMECUBE GAMES: OPTION 1. Get ""Dolphin"" gamecube emulator at www.dolphin-emu.com/downloads.php AND PLAY WITH A .GCM FILE (ISO=GCM just rename the file if it's an iso file) but this laggs aLOT, because of the custom processor in the GC processes things differently than a computer processor. The 450mHz GC processer doesn't lagg. A P4 4500mHz does. You get max 10 fps, it isn't worth the try.
OPTION 2. Get yourself a modchip, e.g Viper GC Extreme . This needs to be soldered inside your cube, and voids warranty. Also you need to buy mini DVD's and if you don't have one - a REGULAR DVD-RW drive. Burn the downloaded iso to the disc, and follow the modchip instructions. again - .gcm=.iso
To play on emulator rename to .gcm, to burn, rename to .iso"

,CheesusTehLord,2009-07-21T07:24Z,"damn, torrent works fine besides that missing 23rd part, but the emulation itself is totally broken for me. i cant actually race without it exploding into nothing"
,xxKerosene,2011-04-26T07:25Z,"Guys, don't even bother downloading this, there's a missing file. I'll attempt to make a torrent of this game that actually works, so stay tuned."
