,prisca22,2009-03-13T12:51Z,Could the uploader please tell me which recording this is?
,prisca22,2009-03-18T20:13Z,Please seeeed. I've been stuck at 89.2% for 3 days!
,twistles,2009-05-26T16:33Z,"Going by the filenames, this is ""S. Hennig, R. Jacobs - Concerto Vocale"" version.

I'll upload a Kirkby/Bowman version later this week."
,twistles,2009-05-26T16:35Z,"https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3516511/ seems to be the Kirkby / Bowman version.  Which is nice.

Will pop up the Fisher / Chance version from the Hyperion label instead.  "
,twistles,2010-01-09T16:43Z,"Notice this is now at 0/19 : assume dead as all look stuck at 89.2% (though it may come alive again, I guess).  Will upload a FLAC version of this same Jacobs / Henning version in about an hour.

Btw ... didn't manage to upload the Hyperion version I mentioned a few months ago, above, as the first track on my CD refused to rip.  "
