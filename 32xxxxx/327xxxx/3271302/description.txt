In his day, there was no bigger star in the music universe than Artie Shaw. The jazz clarinetist and bandleader's rendition of Hoagy Carmichael's Stardust was one of the best-known songs of the 20th century. Shaw's recording of Begin the Beguine sold millions and helped him dethrone Benny Goodman as the King of Swing.
