When the earth spits out the dead, they will rise to suck the blood of the living!

A doctor on a tropical island accidentally causes the dead to return to life as zombies through his experiments
A great zombieflick, if you ask me.  It was labeled the goriest movie ever during the beginning of the eightees, and pukebags where handed out to the audience at the cinemas. Now, people laugh at that fact. But it's still a great movie.
