,killswitch22,2008-09-11T19:47Z,"Awesome , finally got it working. I was having some trouble installing it , kept getting a ""windows 16 bit subsystem error"". I did some research and found out I was missing  ""command.exe"" from the system 32 registry. If anyone's having the same problems you might consider checking your registry, you might be missing some files or they may be corrupted. 

You can get the missing files here:

,crazyoliv,2012-07-17T22:19Z,"Don't extract the folder into a very ramified branch of your C: root. Because the filename will be to big.

Extract it in the C: root as an instance.

I f***ing hate C source code.
"
,crazyoliv,2012-07-17T22:26Z,"Using the KeyCode from Mickey2Much the installation seemed to worked properly.

They asked me about the installation of a WDstuff. It has the same problem with the filename.
