Click for a larger version VMWare is a virtual machine software. It is like VirtualPC for Windows. It allows you to run a ""guest"" Operating System inside of a ""host"" operating system. Once this guest operating system is running you can install Applications and run services that the Guest OS supports. For example, if your host OS is Linux you can run Windows 2000, Windows XP or Windows 9x and you will be able to run applications for Windows inside of that environment. and vice versa. VMWare is built by no other than VMWare Inc. It is offered in 2 flavors, VMWare Workstation or VMWare Server. "
