Kept the original menus
Kept both original french audio tracks DD5.1 and DTS
Kept all subtitles: Swe, Nor, Dan, Fin

Something had to go and it was ALL EXTRAS (2.5 Gb)!

Quality of the movie is approx. 90% of the original, so U shouldn't see any difference.
Well, there is just a little thing. Don't play with the EXTRAS menu. Your DVD player may hang.
Maybe someone else should make a FIX for it ?

Well, enjoy the movie,
