,rajagaja,2008-03-19T12:09Z,"usually both video file n subtitle file both must b kept in a single folder n while playing it is automatically loads.but that did not happened this time...with trials wth several players...

hope uploader wll help....."
,SpiderDave,2008-03-22T08:29Z,"The subtitle file is named differently than the avi file, so it won't be autodetected:

Rashomon.DVDRip.DivX-VCDVaULT.avi
Rashomon.DVDivX-VCDVaULT.srt

Just make a copy of the .srt file and name it Rashomon.DVDRip.DivX-VCDVaULT.srt"
