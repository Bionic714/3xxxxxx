Review by MacKenzie Wilson 
With "Moon & the Sky" from their eighth studio album, Loveboat, Erasure brightens its cheeky dance-pop for something glossy and stylish. The single itself is vibrant with lush trance loops, and Andy Bell's vocal delight is carefree and exciting. Four additional remixes of the song are included, and five acoustic bonus tracks are also featured. The Supremes' "Baby Love" is angelically sweet, and the jaunty rock of "Freedom" shines a new light on Erasure's signature dance flair. The tweaked version of "A Little Respect" is heavenly with simplistic guitar work, although the romance surrounding one of Erasure's greatest hits remains the same. Moon & the Sky is a sure collector's item for any die-hard fan. 
Review from Allmusic.com, the record got 2.5 stars out of 5
