Rage Films and Team Thirteen were given huge props with their last film The Junkshow Diaries, which got nominated for five Powder Video Awards. Stimulus is sure to deliver! This is a movie made out of passion for the sport. Stimulus documents the skiing talent and off-snow antics of today's fearless skiers. Jamie Pierre, Jon Olsson, Rex Thomas, Heath Ordway, Gordy Piefer, Sage Cattabriga-Alosa, Ben Wheeler, Jack Hannan, Jon Johnston, Ian McIntosh and Ryan Oakden are just some of the skiers the film follows. "It's by far my best movie segment of the season, possibly ever,' said Jamie Pierre. "It's the only film that has my record cliff drop of 185 feet in Engelberg, Switzerland." Rex Thomas said: "The movie is a super progressive blend of big mountain lines, terrain park shenanigans and back country boosters, put together with super innovative editing and creativity."
