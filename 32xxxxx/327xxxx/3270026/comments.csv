,h_alten,2005-01-01T02:58Z,This is by far the best manga I've seen. You really feel with the characters
,Nargathos,2005-04-04T13:14Z,is this movie a part of the anime serie or is it a standalone movie of the serie?
,AK_740,2005-05-28T20:37Z,Can somebody seed?
,GG,2006-11-14T20:34Z,seed plz=)
,Zetoss,2006-12-03T21:13Z,Too bad it's not real actors and stuff :/ the description had me aiming for the download link for a few seconds
,Fluke Hawkins,2007-01-07T01:59Z,"Seriously, people. Seed this. This is the first manga I ever read, and I personally love it. Pity there were only two episodes made, though- it was better recieved in the states than in Japan. Thank God for James Cameron."
,Darkenigma75,2008-06-19T07:59Z,I love how until last year there were no copies of this out until somebody seeded a copy of the DVD. Then everybody leeched it and then took credit for it. 
,Darkenigma75,2008-06-19T08:00Z,"Oh, and if anyone wants an ISO of the original DVD, let me know. "

,donpedro,2009-02-27T21:45Z,"I have this on VHS somewhere in the cellar. Great stuff!

If they ever made it into a new movie (I seriously doubt Hollywood has the intellect to spot this one, they'll stick with Marvel) it'll be rendered as a beat-em-up and miss the whole point.

It'll be like Transformers, Michael Bay (did crap like Armageddon and The Rock) butchered the entire franchise by making a two hour long movie about explosions and ugly ass robots."
