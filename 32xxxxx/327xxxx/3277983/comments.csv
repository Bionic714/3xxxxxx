4. Click Fix. 

5. Name of the program to be fixed: Settlers IV - Name of the vendor for this program: Blue Byte.

If you are having trouble with this error I recommend you to install the update patches that are available for download in the internet. 

There are two update patches: 

SIV_1516.exe (12.5 MB) 
This file will update all versions of Settlers IV to version 2.50.1516 
Download link page (I couldnt find it on the official page, but I found it at gamershell.com): 
http://www.gamershell.com/download_4262.shtml 

SIV_10XX_1516.exe (5.5 MB) 
This file will update all versions since 2.00.1050 (Trojan?s Add-on) to version 2.50.1516 
Download link page:

""First make sure you have the settlers icon on your desktop, just drag it on if its not already there.

Then right click it and click on properties, you should now see a compatibility tab on the top, click it. set the mode to windows 98/ windows Me and tick the box to run it in that compatibility.

Click apply then ok and try re launching the game this should hope fully work for you."""
