Personal Power II: The Driving Force is a 30-day program designed to help you determine what you really want out of life and teach you how to get it. This is the same program you have probably seen advertised in television infomercials on many occasions.

This program was my introduction to the work of Anthony Robbins. If you are familiar with my writing in the bodybuilding magazines, you may be aware I am a big fan of his. I credit his work for helping me focus on and achieve many of my "unbelievable" bodybuilding accomplishments. Along the way, I also improved the overall quality of my life.

If you are motivated to take your training to the next level, consider learning how your mind already works. Currently, I am going through the program for the third time since 1993. It is a great tool for making continuing improvements in every facet of my life. 

You must give this program 100 percent effort and follow through on every assignment Tony gives you. Believe me, it will make all the difference in the world and be well worth your time.
