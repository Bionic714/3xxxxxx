This movie is the sequel of August Underground. If someone have it, please seed it. Since this movie actually have nothing to do with the first one, it's okay to watch it. It is one of the goriest movies I've ever seen. Not that i care. The only thing i actually care about is that the chicks sticks a severved cock in her mouth... yeah... It's about three serial killers who videotape all their deeds and the effects is really fucking good for an amateur movie. The movie is made the same amateur way the Blair Witch Project movie was made, and should we wieved just for the hell of it, or if not for the FX. Check IMDB if this crappy info wasn't enough.
