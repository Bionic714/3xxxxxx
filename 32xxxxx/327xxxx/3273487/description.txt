This album, their second for Capitol Records, was released in 1985. It was produced by Eddie Kramer, who produced KISS and Jimi Hendrix among many others. Having Eddie Kramer produce this record gave it a more polished sound. This, along with excellent songs, should have gotten the band significant radio airplay. For whatever reason this never happened in the US. They toured with a new singer trying to gain interest in the album but it really never got the airplay it needed, or deserved.
