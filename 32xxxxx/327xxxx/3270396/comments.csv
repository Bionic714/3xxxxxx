Thank you. I uploaded this 4 years ago. check back on it just now. I havenn't been in torrent in a long time. I never thought it would still be alive.
Thank you everyone. It seems like you all are seeding and keeping this torrent alive! :)"
[V],thegoldman,2008-08-16T16:39Z,"hi batmolebile,
I guess it must be a world record for a torrent to have survived four years! :-)
If you still have this movie with you, can you tell me about this info:-
Duration of the movie
Audio MP3 Bitrate
thanx"

,grantu9998,2009-06-28T17:57Z,movie is indeed very nice video quality. audio is dreadfully low though. nothing a little equalizer cant fix.
,sayfu,2010-01-05T00:29Z,"Thanks nice quality, it's incredible that the torrent is still alive aktough it's a zip file. Coz most people delete it after complete dwld coz they wanna save space or something like that."

When i started downloading it, i was like holy... its been uploaded more than 5 years ago and it still has 15 seeders! when im done downloading it should be 16. Thanks to those who continue seeding!=)"

,pinkhottie,2012-01-10T17:02Z,I have never seeded before. How do i SEED?
,Captin_Gray,2012-07-08T05:28Z,"@pinkhottie don't quote me on this but, I believe to seed you just leave open UTorrent (or whatever) and don't stop the download or pause it after it's finsished downloading. It automatically seeds."
