<strong>IceEncoding Notes:</strong> Ok, i put together the swedish subs to go with it. However, to preserve all your funny characters, i had to save it in Unicode. Which will make almost every subtitle capable player not display it. There are 2 steps to make it work though (if you are that non-english savvy).

1) Download the <a href="http://www.plankdoo.com/pics/svenska.srt">sub</a>, open it in notepad, go to file --> save as, for the Encoding choose ANSI and overwrite. This will lose all the special chars, which in these subs consist only of Å, å and ñ.

2) Download the <a href="http://www.plankdoo.com/pics/svenska.srt">sub</a>, then download the windows port of the bestest linux video player: <a href="http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/win32-beta/MPlayer-mingw32-1.0pre6.zip">mplayer</a>. It doesn't require installing, just extract it somewhere. Then you'll need to start cmd.exe, work your way to where mplayer.exe is and type in this:

"mplayer.exe path/eternal.sunshine.of.the.spotless.mind.dvdrip.xvid-ice.ogg -sub path/svenska.srt -utf8" without the quotes.

This will open the movie with the new player and display the subs correctly.  The just press F and enjoy.
