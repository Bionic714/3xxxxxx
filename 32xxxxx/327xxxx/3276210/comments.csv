,tumza1982,2008-09-16T14:44Z,i am having a problem to downloading this album
,Mastermind575,2009-03-09T03:05Z,"do not download this torrent!

for the following reasons

1. the author ""double zipped"" the content making it a gigantic mess to unzipp and to store

2. the songs are a huge jumbled mess of incorrect track numbers, track titles.

the songs are good but it is not worth it when a seeder has to manually rename EVERY song and track number

""peom"" you FAIL"
