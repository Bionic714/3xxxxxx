OK here's three TV documentaries with Joe Strummer, these are all really interesting and are a must have for any Clash or Joe fan. The Story Of The Clash which was a MTV UK 120 minutes special has a great interview with Joe on a canal boat plus pots of complete songs. The wired interview from channel 4 in the UK is good and looks like it was done at the same time. The Ex-S programme was only shown in Scotland and features Richard jobson and Joe Strummer and is hilarious, watch out for my favourite line ever "What do you think of that then Jobson" The way Joe says it is hilarious, all these are quite rare but an essential part of any punks history lessons, enjoy!

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
