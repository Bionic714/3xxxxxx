,NuRome,2009-12-27T14:27Z,"ยกDios Mios! If that is true (that you encoded in mono) then I say bravo on your fiendish prank. You have served the music industry well by sabotaging the satisfaction the rest of us get by downloading our favorite tunes. BTW - I have bought and paid for almost everything I have downloaded at one time or another, in the case of Zombie I have purchased his stuff numerous times only to lose it or have it get stolen buy jealous gf's."
