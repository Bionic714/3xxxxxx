,Flaccube,2004-12-31T11:54Z,"Tackar, jo den är god... Bara önskar jag hade lite fetare tråd... det tar för lång tid att seeda känns det som när alla hoppar på ens Torrents som gamar =))))"
,oi_or_io,2004-12-31T12:06Z,i heard rio karma have ogg/flac support and if i have one of flac cube seeds today i'll got the chance to hear what it sounds like on karma :D
,Flaccube,2004-12-31T12:13Z,"I also use Rio Karma, definitely the best player on the market, and you WILL hear a BIG difference on FLAC music and MP3s. That's why I decided to trash my Mp3collection of 20 000 songs and just restart and ONLY use FLAC. I think every1 should do the same.... =)"
,oi_or_io,2005-01-03T11:33Z,"loaded, tested and loved! you're right cube, flac kicks mp3's ass!!! gotta buy some storage though... "
,Flaccube,2005-01-03T14:46Z,"Just keep in touch oieoi....

I got plenty of albums, requests are obviously something I'd rather seed than just whatever I drop by =)"
,oi_or_io,2005-01-04T10:20Z,"i would  like to hear some front 242 or front line assembly in flac if you have any. maybe i can rip some cd too from my poor collection if i move my lazy ass.  anyway, i'll watch your seeds cube. keep us alive!!! :D"
,Flaccube,2005-01-10T17:43Z,Make sure you use EAC before making FLACs out of it =)
,alibaba94,2007-03-17T17:11Z,Hatar synthmusik! depeche kan ju gå o hänga sig
,mickzt,2008-04-27T21:41Z,Dude. I'm new at this torrent thing and abit green with file sharing in general but I'm trying to find  a way to share some music I have in my hard disc. I'll find a way and that way I will have felt that I've done my part.
