You are the freelancer Edison Trent, an intergalactic jack-of-all-trades. Your mission: whatever you want. Become a smuggler or a ruthless space thug, a naval hero or a trader. Dodge through asteroid fields while piloting elite spacecraft. The action is endless as you make your way through 48 known star systems. Greed, morality, compassion, anger... whatever motivates you, the dynamic universe will respond. Take the first step. The universe is waiting.

Men visst är det en del skjuta... påminner lite i ideen om det gamla goda Elit, till Amigan"

I tired quickly of this. It's the same thing over and over and there's only 3 different ships in the game (with modifications) and a few different types of guns. They only get better by damage, hit points and so on.
Still, it's pretty fun for a little while.
