Det Insp William Edward, "Jack", Frost alternates his police duties in Denton, a town in southern England near Bristol, with nursing his terminally-ill wife, Mary, leaving her in the care of nurse Shirley Fisher during the day. He is assigned a new Detective Constable, Clive Barnard, the nephew of the chief constable, to assist him in the investigation of a missing young child, Tracy Uphill. Barnard incidentally discovers that Frost has been awarded the George Cross not long before, for trying to disarm a man, being shot twice in the incident. While looking for the missing girl in local woods, the police uncover a man's severed arm chained to a locked strong box, which turns out to be empty. Checking with Sandy Longford, the editor of the local Denton Evening News, identifies it with the robbery of two men making a bank transfer that occurred 30 years previously. Soon after Frost interviews the survivor of the robbery, Ronald Garwood, he is found shot dead, by the same gun that killed the other man at the time. Frost's wife finally dies, at Denton Hospital, leaving him bemused and with just his work to occupy his life now. He correcly identifies the person behind the robbery and killings, though this involves him with another face-down with an armed person, and the girl is handed in to the hospital.
