A repost of bandit999's post - Disorder Live Bootleg Oslo TV 1987 30mins

This is in SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. You can use a few other programmes but this one is free and i think its the best all round player. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.

If you have nero installed then it has a box you can tick to burn it to NTSC(american video standard)
