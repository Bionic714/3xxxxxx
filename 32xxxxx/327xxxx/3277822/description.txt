Today is a big day for GC owners, as one of the best rated games (RE4)  
for the system was just released. To celebrate with you, we decided we  
would give you a new version of our Cobra BIOS. It allows PAL users     
to play their RE4 import, which was not possible with Cobra 0.2 !       
                                                                        
What's the Cobra BIOS ? A special BIOS specially tailored for your      
Viper GC that allows yo to run your backups (and now homebrew code!)   
from the GC drive using DVD(-/+)R or Mini-DVD(+/-)R!                    
                                                                        
So what do you need exactly ?
