,orione,2005-01-10T23:42Z,"The cycle of seven cantatas, Membra Jesu Nostri, 
was probably completed in 1680 (the dedication to 
Gustav D端ben dates from the same year) and presents a 
very remarkable sense of unity of style in the setting 
of series of Latin texts taken, in the arias, from the 
poem Rythmica oratio ascribed to Bernard of Clairvaux.

The pietist qualities of fervour and dolorism dominate 
the work with an obviously deliberate tendency to 
symbolism; in a garland of telling images the music 
lives and breathes in compatibility with the words,  
borne by the concern for figuralism which clearly 
expresses the mystical instinct of the master of Oldes
loe, the great mediator of German spirituality between
Sch端tz (he was very close to Johann Theile, the viola 
da gamba player and direct heir of Sch端tz in his 
St. Matthew Passion) and Bach."
