,wilma,2005-01-24T00:15Z,"is it something i missed?

I have burnet this movie 2 times now and i cant highlight the selections in the menu...
So when i go in my dvd players program i can start it, but after 18 minutes the sound dissapears and it jumps from one chapter to another chapter...

tell me...is it me or your rip?

:-("
,mskot,2005-01-26T13:07Z,"wilma: nope, same here... Sound disappears after 18-20 min. But it works perfectly on my computer...anyone knows what i'm doing wrong?"
,Yayita,2005-01-26T17:00Z,"This iso image is corrupted!!!!!!
Skellington we all appreciate you want to upload a movie, but if you do not know how to create a propper DVD ISO image do not post crap. You are wasting everybody's bandwidth.
USE DVD Decrypter!!!
:(!!! :(!!!
Aggghhh!!"
,Skellington,2005-01-26T22:40Z,"Eh... I used DVD Decrypter, DVD Rebuilder, Imgtool and finally MakeTorrent. I had no probs during the rip, so I really don't know why it doesn't work!

Is there anyway to repair the rip or do I have to try to rip it again? The only odd thing about this rip is that it is region 2, so when decrypted it DVD Region Free started and let me read it (otherwise my pc is set on reg. 2)

I would appreciate an explanation..."
,NerveBlast,2005-03-20T10:32Z,How about seeding? Please? ;)
,Momijigari,2006-07-01T08:17Z,"does anyone have ""Hairspray"" dvd? if so, please share!"
