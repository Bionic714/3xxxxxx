,skn,2005-01-06T05:15Z,Nice upload:-) I have an orig copy of HL2 so unfort i cant try this one out. Dont wanna pay money for a 5 year old game that I bought at retail a long time ago. 
,SniperFin,2005-01-06T16:13Z,Vengeance has their own steam engine and other stuff altered to make the game work without internet connection. In nforce forums people report that they have not got this rel working with other than vengeance release. I do not recommend that you download this rel if you do not have vengeances rel of the game.

,juks30,2008-11-04T16:42Z,I click the hlsinstall.exe then a black box will pop up for 1 second and then closes and the game is not installed. Can anybody tell me what i have to do to make it work????
,LordOrwell,2009-05-27T11:10Z,real simple:  the difference between half life and half life source is some effects use physics now to take advantage of the source engine.  paper-doll deaths.  The bad news is they never released a texture pack for source so the hi-res texture pack makes the original look better.  And i am not sure why the uploader claimed the source version runs faster.  That's just silly.  The original one will run on a pentium.
