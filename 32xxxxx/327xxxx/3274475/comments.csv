you can run only one sub at the time I think :), 
name the .srt sub-files that u want as same as the movie.

eg:


White Dragon.avi
White Dragon.srt


hope it helps :)"
,shakspeare,2005-03-02T17:49Z,"Thank you for the suggestion,
Unfortunately I tried that and that is what is baffling me.... When I take the other sub out of the folder the english sub doesnt show up at all... I dont know how that could happen with two different versions of the movie....I would think it was a codec problem but one the other sub works totally fine....."
,shakspeare,2005-03-02T17:57Z,"Im sorry.... I actually misunderstood your comment, You were actually correct
By changing the name of the srt file to match the avi the sub titles became enabled....
Thank you very much for taking the time to offer your assistance
:)"
