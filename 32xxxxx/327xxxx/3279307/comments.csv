Använd den officiella på www.mame.net eller MAME32 på www.classicgaming.com/mame32qa.
MAME är ett öppet projekt med ganska fria riktlinjer för vad som är tillåtet, men MAME32k har brutit mot definitiva regler för vad som är tillåtet."
,darknatas,2005-01-20T12:28Z,dont know what u said dont speak ur language but this mame has kaillera support so u can play online so every1 please enjoy
,Whippa,2005-01-20T16:50Z,he said that this mame client is breaking some mame rulez :X
,DrYes,2005-01-20T18:19Z,"MAME32k and Kaillera breaks the MAME license by failing to provide the full source code. Apreciate the fact that MAME is free and open and do not support attempts to take away that freedom. Taking closed source and making it public is a good thing, but taking open source and making it closed is a crime against humanity.

MAME32 and the official MAME is just as good, except that there is no Kaillera code in it. Use the real stuff and support the efforts of MAME developers to keep it free and open source. If you don't like the original or MAME32, there are loads of other derivative builds which do not try to take away your freedom, so there is really no need for MAME32k."
,darknatas,2005-01-21T06:31Z,yea but if there was no kaillera in the first place then no1 would ever use mame.... so if u dont wanna down load the file so u can play games online then by all means dont download the file but ops wait looks like u already did download   lmao...... end of topic... have fun every1...
,DrYes,2005-01-21T07:24Z,"You don't understand fuck about what MAME is. MAME is not about enhancing the games, it is about documentation and recreating them as closely as possible to the originals. The originals did not have network play or online play, so neither should MAME.

It is sad when someone puts huge amount of work into providing something for free and someone else steals it and takes away that freedom. This is exactly what MAME32k is doing to the MAME community and the MAME project.

And no, I did not download it and I will not download it."
