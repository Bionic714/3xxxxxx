,Temptation,2005-01-20T06:15Z,"Thank you!  Great show.. Finally, after Sienfield, an American sitcom that's smart and funny and not about a silly American nuclear family where the man is always fat and stupid, the woman is always way more attractive than the man and apparently always smarter, and the plot every week is about how the man is a moron and the woman is always right and somewhere between there's some predictable hijinks with their teenage kids.
