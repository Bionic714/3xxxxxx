"Woman is The Future of Man" puts Korea's cinema back on track!

Hong Sang-su's explicit tapestry of human emotions and behaviour is at its best again in this tale about two long-time friends who have had an affair with the same woman. Hon-jun (Kim Tae-woo) makes his own movies, while Mun-ho (Yoo Ji-tae) has picked up an educational job as arts teacher. By chance the two friends meet again talking about old times and come across the topic of their shared past love Son-hwa (Sung Hyun-ah). As a result, they decide to meet Son-hwa together one more time â€¦

Portraying real-as-life characters with very natural human traits in a movie void of any commercial Hollywood action and glamour, Hong Sang-su's latest work turns into another success for contemporary Korean avant-garde cinema.

Top actor Joo Ji-tae has re-written Korean film history by enjoying double nominations at the Cannes Film Festival for Woman is The Future of Man and Old Boy . For Woman is The Future of Man he shunned no efforts to gain over 20 pounds to fit into his assigned role.
