,Fudoh,2005-01-20T18:07Z,I'm sorry but this rip is a mess. or am I missing a codec? it's all jerky with lots of artefacts. makes me wanna cry.
,azazelo,2005-01-20T19:36Z,"double thanks, Orion
I'll comment as soon as I check my dl.
I'll also see if there's any problem/ missing codec
"
,azazelo,2005-01-21T20:55Z,"thanks again for this excellent film.

however, it is NOT dvd friendly. it is encoded as (fourcc) MP42, the old MS encoder. which is not accepted by most, or all, dvd divx players. making it so involves re-encoding (to ""normal"" divx or xvid), which is a long process, which also deteriorates quality.

as for the others, you should download mp42 decoder for your software player. not the best encoding, sorry to say. 

thanks anyway mate,"
