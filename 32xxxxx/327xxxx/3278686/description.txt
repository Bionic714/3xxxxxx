Du Rififi Chez les Hommes [Rififi] ~  Dassin _ French with Eng. subbs
The modern heist movie was invented in Paris in 1954 by Jules Dassin, with Rififi.
Echoes of the Dassin can be found from Kubrick's The Killing to Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. They both owe something to John Huston's The Asphalt Jungle(1950), which has the general idea but not the attention to detail.
Rififi was called by Francois Truffaut the best film noir he'd ever seen (it was based, he added, on the worst noir novel he'd ever read).  Dassin's inspiration was to expand the safe-cracking job, which is negligible in the book, into a breathless sequence that occupies a fourth of the running time and is played entirely without words or music. So meticulous is the construction and so specific the detail of this scene that it's said the Paris police briefly banned the movie because they feared it was an instructional guide.
The movie opens with a backroom poker game....
