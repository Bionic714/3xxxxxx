,fladvad,2007-02-28T05:48Z,"If there is anyone out there with this collection on their hard-drives I would be very happy if some one reseeded it. I will make sure it becomes a bit easier to get hold of in the future if that is so.

Can anyone spell OiNK?"

We're 11 who are trying for a full version of this torrent.

,SCLEMTAK,2009-05-31T03:47Z,"Either re-seed this brilliant collection Mr.Muppio
or have the decency to remove this dead torrent.I would be willing (like most of the other people complaining) to seed this for as long as it takes.And would not abandon it like all of the other leeching scumsuckers who did not bother to seed it afterwoods did."
