,Hop,2006-01-16T16:37Z,"This is about Shaolin, but it's not Discovery Channel.  It's CHinese-made, and it's in mandarin (with burned in Chinese and Chinglish subtitles).

It's alright, but it's not Discover Channel quality."

,Torrentministern,2007-06-26T01:47Z,Drunken Iron Eggs - a Classic!
,iamdagreatkornholio,2007-07-04T19:29Z,"Towards the end, the documentary focussed on a man named Li Lian Je. He is Jet Li. A very young Jet Li. Jet Li = movie star."
,aldo45,2008-03-01T10:28Z,"I think some of you guys need to take this with a pinch of salt. YES!! It is a good documentary about the Shaolin monks. YES! its does feature Jet Li as a child. YES! some of the training scenes are good but PLEASE remember this was made as a propaganda film in COMMUNIST CHINA. Some of the feats are quite clearly staged and others insanely over-rated. The ONLY so-called ""monks"" at Shaolin now are those who practice Wushu (THIS IS NOT REAL SHAOLIN KUNGFU!!). Do some research about it online!!!"
