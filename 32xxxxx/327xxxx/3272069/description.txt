So first, SCUMMVM runs most of the old point'n'click games with ease on WinXP and others that cant handle it.

Launch "scummvm.exe"
Choose "Add Game..."
Browse your way to the SCUMMVM folder and into the games folder.
The browse the gamefolder that you would like to play then choose "Choose" when youre in that folder.

You should figure out the rest with ease.. even though this wasnt anything hard either it got you started.
