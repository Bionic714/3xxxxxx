,systemloc,2008-03-10T22:58Z,"OMG! Thank you so much! I've been looking all over for something like this! I must pass it on to the rest of the geeks in my class as well!

Also, to any other med geeks: merck medicus is available to med students free, and has the merck manual, harrison's practice, and the pocket guide to diagnostic tests, all available free.

Thank you again, wozzaworld!"
