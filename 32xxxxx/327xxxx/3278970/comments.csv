Virker som om 1/4 eller 1/3 av dialogen er på japansk, problematisk uten subs!"

Den är på engelska huvudsakligen. Men eftersom skaparna av filmen ville att tittaren skulle vara lika ""clueless"" som Richard ""Blackthorne"" Chamberlain så är japanska talet inte textat. Det berättas ibland dock ibland vad de säger och man missar egentligen ingenting av handligen."
