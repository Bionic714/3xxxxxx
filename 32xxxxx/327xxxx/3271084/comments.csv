,Atmosfear,2004-12-31T23:04Z,"So I have to learn Cantonese, or what do they speak in Korea? (sorry for my un-knowing-ness...)"
,tacky2883,2005-01-01T01:31Z,Just like da title says Korean...
,Magma,2005-01-01T19:19Z,"Just great.
I like asian movies, hollywood can suck my dick.
But my Korean is too bad (I can read korean, but I don't understand anything they say).
The movie is from 2001, but I can't find it on IMDB, and not on google. That's kind of strange.
I hope a sub is released soon.
Keep up the good work lads, release the sub on Pirate Bay if you find it."
,Magma,2005-01-01T19:34Z,"I found it on IMDB.
I searched on google (korean sites), found out that the korean title was ""geunyeo-ege jamda"" (directly read from the korean letters, I don't know if it's accurate due to my poor knowledge in the korean language).
Then I searched on the title on IMDB, and found out that the korean title is writen ""Geunyeoege jamdeulda"".

I tryed to translate the title, and directly translated it's ""She to fall asleep""."
