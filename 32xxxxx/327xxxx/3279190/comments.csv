,luke_s,2010-11-11T17:10Z,You can also find LOTS of apps on the English Amiga Board site (eab.abime.net). I downloaded them all and I'm trying to share them in a torrent here but after 6 weeks of trying to upload and only getting error messages I'm giving up.
,luke_s,2011-01-21T16:23Z,I think I might finally have been able to get my torrent working. Feel free to check it out: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5950028/Commodore_Amiga_-_Applications_-_ADF_%28TOSEC_20100813%29 in case Bwoy's torrent is dead or doesn't contain the programs you wanted
