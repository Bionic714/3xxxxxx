,Bruenor,2005-01-14T18:25Z,"Awesome !!!! If you could go a little further, like s5 complete.... I would kneel before you and pray.... (or maybe not..)
Thx so much 4 this.

Btw S1 dvdrip has been released for a while now, the only season that's on dvd so far (I used emule to find them, try with: xvid-river)  though I can't tell if the ep look better than the FOV TVrips, let's say a little. (it's 230mb as well)

If anyone has or knows how to find s03ep09 FOV plz talk to Keckis he deserves it. Thx."
