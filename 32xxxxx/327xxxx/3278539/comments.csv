Please upgrade to Ad-Aware SE.

We are now discontinuing reference file and product support for Ad-Aware 6 and urge users to upgrade their existing copies to the new Ad-Aware SE. We continued support of the older version of Ad-Aware to allow users time to upgrade while still enjoying the protection they have come to expect from our software."""
