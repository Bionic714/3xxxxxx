Sygate is a great firewall.....but....not this one....
DO NOT install it on youre computer....it works fine for like a week but then the shit starts happening....
i lost acess to ie and msn....some weird shit i dont know much about....i solved the problem but it took a very long time doing it...my advise.....dont use this version...loads of spyware and junk....my spyware remover found like 400 spy components after installing it.Im useing bulletproof spyware remover...its the best damn prog for that kind of tasks.
Look for other type of firewalls!!!!!
