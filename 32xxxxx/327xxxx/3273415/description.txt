Often advertised as "rural" progressive, this pleasant album full of gentle rock songs isn't that progressive at all. It's pleasantness is mainly due to the agreeable voice of the vocalists and the beautiful melodies on some of the tracks. There are no technical pyrotechnics, but instead a clever use of acoustic instruments provides a very listenable texture. Standing out is Acimo And Noiram with a lovely melodic line along with Many Tribesmen. The opening track Home For Frozen Roses wouldn't be out of place on a Paul Simon album! The other tracks are nice enough, but do not contain much substance. Worth a spin, but do not pay the astronomical prices asked nowadays.
