,dk-,2005-02-12T19:44Z,"First of all. Thanks Alkiss, MASH isn't the easiest series to find :).

But I can't download this one. I read the thing about bittornado, but since I am on Linux and only has console I have to use either BitTornade or BitTorrent and it doesn't work with either of them. Anyone has a tip on another client?"
