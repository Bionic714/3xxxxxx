,johanivallda,2005-02-10T09:06Z,"I dont get this torrent to run. It gets ""stopped"" all the time. I have room for it. ?"
,friedaweed,2005-02-11T12:35Z,"Torrents not working, downloads the folders but then won't recognise the destination for downloading the torrent. Tried it on tornado too and same problem.

Hope you get this fixed it's a great torrent but have to agree with comments it might have been better to split it up.

Thanks for your efforts all the same. "
,jackl,2005-04-17T16:10Z,"I think heruur nailed it. I just tried downloading to a subdirectory on my desktop and after pausing/resuming the torrent got an error. Now I'm saving it straight to my C: dir and there was nothing wrong.

It will, however, take 19 days to finish at this rate :P (must be my slow Aussie connection).. nah it'll speed up. Really looking forward to this one! Keep seeding please!"
,sunefrack,2005-06-11T01:03Z,puh! this gonna take a while to leach...i hope you keep it alive! ;)
,ghostWolf,2005-06-19T04:46Z,"NestGavle, you're a legend - one thing missing though that I have been trying to get my hands on for a long time now ...
sofa no 1 - aucoustic guitar version - think Steve Vai is playing it - Even if this were done outside Frank Zappa - this version just have to be part of an excellent compilation like this one.

If anyone knows where this aucustic version of sofa no1 can be found, please let me know.

,waccu,2006-01-24T08:20Z,"This torrent is very BIG because the bit rate of this music is very high. The lovest bit rate I have seen so far is 192kbps, but nearly and almost every song in this torrent is 320kbps. Thats the reason for this torrent being BIG.
But I like that the music is in HIGH quality. everyone loving Zappa should get this torrent.
Thanks alot Nestgavle."

,pirateleech,2006-04-02T13:47Z,"Why is ""Let's make the water turn black"" on ""we're only in it for the money"" speeded up? Sounds awful and nothing like the original."
,Makki_Mann,2006-06-25T18:34Z,"I like Frank Zappa, I realy do, and if nobody starts seeding, i will get very angry, and if someone then knocks on my door trying to get donations to save children in Somalia, I'l just not donate, and therefor are people that's not willig to seed/leech killers (indirectly of corse)."
,tommbjo,2006-07-07T23:17Z,"Zappa gjorde 316 album, så jag tror inte dom får plats på futtiga 9 gig. Bara en liten tanke från mig til er....... :)"
,uddabudda,2006-07-24T03:01Z,"Tommbjo, gjorde Zappa 316 skivor? Är skivbolaget underrättat? Du kanske räknar in dina bootlegs.... okej, ""all albums"" är kanske inte riktigt med tanke på att ett officiellt album som ""200 Motels"" inte tycks vara med här t ex. Men nog är det en schysst torrent."
,Nest999,2006-08-14T21:17Z,"To all that are interested of zappa - a great site:

Han har vært med på uttallige andre artisters utgivelser, så det er kanskje der 316 album kommer inn :D"
,neverpay,2008-03-25T05:33Z,frank zappa and this torrent will never die.
,DeSeis,2008-03-29T14:02Z,"I get an error and can't continue downloading if I cancel the downloading by shutting down the Torrent client (uTorrent). After restarting uTorrent tells that files are missing.

Does anybody else have this same problem or is it just a ""feature"" in uTorrent and I should try another client?"

,trannyboy,2011-05-29T18:44Z,"Wonderful! Though, i miss 1 album that i find is one of ZappaÂ´s most important works and that is ""King Kong: Jean-Luc Ponty Plays the Music of Frank Zappa"" released in 1969. ItÂ´s not part of ZappaÂ´s discography because it is considered to be a tribute to Frank Zappa but Frank was actually arranger, composer and conductor during the production. ItÂ´s great and i find it to be one of the most important works of his. Listen to the piece ""Music For Electric Violin and Low Budget Orchestra"" itÂ´s a masterpiece (if you like the more esoteric stuff that is). ThereÂ´s 5 more great songs in it. In the song ""How Would You Like to Have a Head Like That"" Zappa plays a guitarsolo. The album in a must-have for every Zappa-fan as it shows yet another side of ZappaÂ´s genious.  It was made in 1969 damnit!  "

,ontheone,2012-08-20T23:40Z,"I just downloaded a few albums from this torrent and some of the first tracks I listened to sound messed up.  The track ""REDUNZL"" on Studio Tan was distorted.  I've only listened to a couple tracks so far so maybe it's just a few, but I'm pretty sure it's the files. Just a heads up.

I'm going to download that album from another torrent and see if it's better."
,zep69,2012-09-04T06:06Z,What an excellent torrent. Thanks a lot!
