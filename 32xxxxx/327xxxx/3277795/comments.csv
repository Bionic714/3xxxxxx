,ReZplinZ,2005-01-23T17:40Z,Hvilken fil er det jeg skal døpe om?
,Finger_best,2005-01-29T21:24Z,"tryck på Install Notes så står det ungefär så här

1) Unrar with WinRAR. 
2) Burn the bin/cue with your favorite Burning software. 
3) Install the game, use the keygen located in the DEViANCE directory 
on the cd when asked for a serial number. 
4) Copy Over the Crack located in the DEViANCE directory on the CD 
5) And then play :)

,erkon_boy,2005-05-07T18:51Z,"gå in på mappen deviance och kopiera filen hppoa.exe. Sen går du in på system och klistrar in den där. Då kommer det upp en fråga om du vill ersätta nånting med nånting klicka på ja

Sen klickar du på hppoa.exe inne i system mappen.

då startar spelet och du slipper skiva och att skriva in
 cd-key

Det funkar inte om du kopierar ut en genväg på skrivbordet."
,eelco,2005-05-16T22:29Z,"Hi y'all,


I dont really understand what to do with the files, coz just the decompressed  rar or zip archive takes up 790 MB. that's too much to burn on one cd. I dont have a dvd burner. Should i burn to 2 cd's ? And then the decompressed files will have be split. What should be where ? Do all the other files (that were not compressed) also have to be burnt on cd ?

Thanks in advance,
eelco"

for whose that got the kw.game problem :
after copied  the hp.exe in the DEVIANCE folder and pasted it to the system folder that you extracted ; verify if in the system folder that is here when you dl the torrent there is the kw.game icon.
if it is there , copy it and paste it in the system folder that you extracted
then launch the hp.exe that you pasted over the 1st hp.exe and it should work  :D
 I write it cuz i understand all the people who wants to dl torrent etc.  but if you dont give a bit of yourself in you'll never understand !
  PS : iwrote a lot and maybe no one will read this  XD"

,AdDeOWN,2008-10-12T22:57Z,"cool , works perfect , well heres my guide , this is the only one that actually works:)

1.Unzip/rar the file named ""Compressed""

Go into DEViANCE folder and copy hppoa and paste it in the ""System"" folder that you got after the un-rar/zipping.

3. Go into the ""Autorun"" folder , click on system ,  there you should find ""KWGameU"" , the file that were missing when you tried to run the game.

4. Copy KWGameU and paste it in ""System"" folder where you pasted hppoa .

5. Run the game from hppoa and play :)."
,joshmiccar,2008-10-26T06:35Z,Hotyboy22 for one in your name you spelled hottie wrong.  and for two if it doesn't work it doesn't work you're getting it without paying so you can't really complain can you?  that's like going to mcdonalds ordering a large water and they give you a medium and then you complain about it.  it may work on arnealek's system when it doesn't on yours.  shit happens deal with it
