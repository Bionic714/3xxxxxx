Tis is a Colletor´s Edition DVD and in NTSC format. There are no subtitles. 
This torrent has all menues and extra material excluded - in spite of that it is reduced 10 % by DVDshrink.

If you behave well (seed, seed and yet - seed) I will share 3:10 to Yuma (Glen Ford) with you in less than a week.  And if that works I have Nevada Smith (Steve McQueen) up my sleeve.
