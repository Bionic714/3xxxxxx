My son gave this to me in all good faith...when checked and played..my player maybe lying to me but when 320 is shown up on lcd, it is taken as a true reading, all my stuff ripped with setting at 320 to get as good quality as possible, if genuine mistake is made I appologise, if not just delete torrent friend, sorry for uploading and wasting your bandwidth and sharing spirit of bt..!"
