,qwerewq,2006-01-04T13:02Z,Metal Gear is not comparable to Splinter Cell. Splinter Cell is that much worse.
,VDR88,2007-05-01T23:47Z,"Splinter Cell - 18 years and up.

MGS - 17 years and younger.

Splinter Cell is more realistic and plays on current event's to gartner the attention of the older gen. gamers.  Whereas MGS was designed for the younger gen. gamers.  

Both great games, I love each one and each one is unique in it's own way.  But SC is for adults, and MGS for those of us not yet fully grown lol. (That's untrue, I'm 25 and I love MGS.)
