Description from IGame Network:

Editorial Review: Based on a wildly popular Japanese anime series, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a fighting game that features 18 weird characters, most of which have a ghostlike spirit friend called a Stand that can be used to perform special moves.

As in other Capcom games, the characters in JoJo's can pull off super combos that are easy to execute, devastating, and often hilarious. In one case, a belly dancer can summon a tidal wave of '57 Chevy cars to knock her foe on his back. Together with their Stands, characters can even double-team opponents, racking up lots of hits with relatively little effort.

Each fighter has his or her own back-story culled from the anime series, and a super story mode forces players to switch characters as the plot unfolds. While JoJo's might not have the depth of other Capcom games, it certainly makes up for its simplicity with an unmistakably odd and fast-paced style. --Robb Guido
