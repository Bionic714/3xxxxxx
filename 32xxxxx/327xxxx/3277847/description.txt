Please Stop Downloading the old one "  Airblade-PS2rip-Oldschool  "
_______________________________________________

This is the proper version and is working 100% now.

Imade a mistake ,I made two ripps and only one was unfourtunatly working and the other one was inproper ,unfourtunatly i zipped and uploaded the inproper version.


So here is the Proper verion of "Airblade"

Correct File ,sorry for the inconvenice
This ripp version has been tested 3 times and should work 100% on almost any CDR.

Tested on Memorex CDR 2 times and Fuji film CDR 700 1 time and so it should work now for you as well.
dont burn to "CDRW" as it wont work on "CDRW" and dont try burning it to any DVD either.
 

__________________________________________________                 
please use Alcohol 120%
for best result. 
and chose Data type as Play Station 2 file mode and leave other settings untouched eccept 
for speed, so change the speed to slowest speed possible and burn it. 

important"""do Not use max speed"""" burn with speed 2X or 4X as long as it is the slowest speed possible you can not go wrong.



The file format is now in "Clone CD Image format" this time insted of "ISO Image file format" as last time.
Thanks for understanding,
and please Enjoy this full working version!
