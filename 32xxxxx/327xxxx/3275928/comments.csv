,spacetragedy,2009-06-10T20:20Z,"very cool film, thanks for the upload more subs in english for this version can be found here: 

http://divxplanet.com/sub/s/71025/Gegen-die-Wand.html

just click on the sub with the English flag and press ""Atlyaziyi Indir'' (which means Download Subtitle in Turkish) located on the center of the screan in black the yellow box outline.

loads more subs mostly in English, Turkish and a few other languages on this site www.divxplanet.com 

Yeah the sites in Turkish but its got a very large subtitle archive so it may come in handy
with fps and version names to simplify finding the right subs', 

just type in the film name in the search box that says ''altyazi Ara'' (search subs) on the center right corner of the page  with the word ''Ara'' (search) highlighted in orange. you can also alternatively search by clickin ''altyazi arama'' (search subs) on the top center part of the page

hope this helps.

ps. Its highly recomended you watch this film stoned. 420"
