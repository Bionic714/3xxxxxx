Release Notes:

Artemis Records has announced the signing of rock trio Better Than Ezra to an
exclusive contract for North America. An album of all-new material, titled
Before The Robots, is slated for a April 12, 2005 release. Formed in 1988 in New
Orleans, Better Than Ezra began their career by playing college bars and
fraternity houses at Louisiana State University. After independently releasing a
cassette-only album in 1990 (Suprise) to great acclaim, the band went on to make
their major label debut in 1995, Deluxe. Fueled by the #1 modern rock smash
"Good", Deluxe earned platinum status. In 1996 the band's follow-up record
Friction Baby went gold and contained two Top Ten modern rock tracks. Better
Than Ezra have released two subsequent albums - 1998's How Does Your Garden
Grow? and 2001's Closer.
