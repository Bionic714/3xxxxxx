,trikztar,2005-01-10T15:40Z,"First of all, it's not nuked on NForce or vcdquality, and second of all the quality is great, so no need to bitch...I personally don't care about scene standards as long as the product is of good quality.

Take it or leave it...

,sloth_666,2005-01-10T19:19Z,Seed!!!
,Bentis,2005-01-10T19:19Z,"it IS nuked at nforce....
get REPACK"
,trikztar,2005-01-10T19:30Z,Yeah it is now...anyway I'll seed the repack when I'm done grabbing it if no one beats me to it...
,trikztar,2005-01-11T12:49Z,Then find it some place else
,weaser,2005-01-11T18:03Z,could not get it to re load! only bits and pieces any advice?
,trikztar,2005-01-11T18:34Z,"Danvig the ""product"" gets nuked if it for some reason doesn't live up to the scene standards. In this case there's nothing wrong with the movie unless you plan to convert it into something else...you can always get the repack though.
"
,weaser,2005-01-11T18:36Z,Excuse my ignorance but how do you get the repak?
,trikztar,2005-01-11T18:48Z,"(I'm sorry if I'm double posting but this site is getting slower by the second) I'm seeding the repack elsewhere on this site - just search for it...

,Skippermart,2005-01-13T12:10Z,"Totally cool movie, thanx for uploading.."
,martimonis,2005-01-13T12:26Z,"Great image but I don't seem to be able to get any sound from the file, even after installing the xvid codec. Anyone got the same problem? Thanks for any help!"
,trikztar,2005-01-13T12:36Z,I don't think the xvid-codec will do anything about the sound. Try installing the latest ac3 codecs
,martimonis,2005-01-13T14:29Z,"Thanks, the AC3 codec worked fine. The sound is a bit low nevertheless. I wonder if it is just me..."
,prewe,2005-01-13T14:32Z,you should change the name of this torrent so people would get the repacked release instead.
,axionman,2005-01-13T19:27Z,I cant download anymore? what the fuck does permisson denied mean? Ive downloaded 94 %. come on. help me
,Malk_al-haq,2005-01-14T01:10Z,"If it says Errno 13 - permission denied, just press Ctrl+Alt+del, and turn off btdownloadgui.exe, and restart the torrent. Should work just fine"
