Is this dubbed or subbed?

I already have the dubbed version, but I'm on the look for the subbed version or atleast the japanese audio version."
,Zouthen,2005-01-25T18:55Z,"It's Dubbed ..: English Dub

,Jucker,2005-01-29T15:22Z,"It's not dubbed, Vampire Hunter D - Bloodlust was one of the few anime movies with english as the original language, the one with japanese audio is the dub."
,Dex,2005-01-30T03:05Z,"There is an earlier version called ""Ky没ketsuki Hunter D"" from 1985. That one is Jap. in original. not as well made, though.

,FiklPikl,2005-08-03T16:29Z,"Back when I rented this a while ago, there was an extras section to the dvd.  The dvd shows commercials for the Japanese release of this film, and it was in english audio and Japanese subs, leading me to believe that this film was created with the english as the original audio."
,Crazy Bastard,2006-04-28T21:59Z,"true.. this movie is originally created for english spoken language, and japanese subs!!"
,Crazy Bastard,2006-04-28T21:59Z,"or atleast it should be ^^,"
