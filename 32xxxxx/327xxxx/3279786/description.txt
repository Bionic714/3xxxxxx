I seriously went to internethell and back just to get an English sub for this movie. Anyway, I found one but i haven't tested it get. 

Who can say no to a little necrophilia? Everyone should watch these movies.

IMDB:
Jorg Buttgereit's "Nekromantik" is one of the most taboo-breaking horror films ever made.Very few movies talk about necrophilia("Aftermath","Kissed","Buio Omega","Lucker" etc.),however this subject is quite fascinating because it draws links between sex and death.Rob(Daktari Lorenz)cleans different places and removes the corpses whenever there was a murder,or an accident.One day,Rob's girlfriend(Beatrice M.)has an idea to steal a corpse and to play with it.The corpse is treated like the third person and all of them make a perverted threesome.But one day Rob is fired from his work and his girlfriend dumps him,and leaves with the dead lover.For Rob it's a beginning of complete madness..."Nekromantik" is pretty gross-there is plenty of yucky gore on display.The ending is truly sick and memorable.So if you like extreme cinema give this one a look.8 out of 10.
