here you got monkey brains http://www.arushgames.com/games/monkeybrains/index.htm

and  Jacks.Boulder.Match-FASiSO the only difference with this jacks game is that i  ripped out only the jacks boulder game, so the actual game is only 50mb but the cd is over 340mb+ so i figured its better this way.. 

btw heres a link for jacks boulder match http://magnussoft.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/141
