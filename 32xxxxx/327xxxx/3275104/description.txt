Everybody's Crazy was released in 1985 on Columbia Records.

'Even though the album did not do well commercially, it is considered to be one of the best AOR albums from that period. Everybody's Crazy was #78 on Kerrang's "100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums Of All Time" (published January 1989). Billboard Review, March 16, 1985:  'Hard rocking vocalist with first class support and strong tunes looks set for an  assault on the pop charts. Solid from start to finish, and sure to garner wide AOR play.''

This album marked the end of Bolton's AOR career, and he himself seems to disavowed this period and the albums he released. Try finding any reference to these albums on his official site! Btw, Bolton's 'Greatest Hits 1985-1995' contain nothing from this album.
