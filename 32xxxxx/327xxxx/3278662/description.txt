PRWEB) December 31 2003--New Movie 2Fast2Real For Hollywood
Liextreme put's the pedal to the metal. No time for "lights, camera, action", just simply shoot and run. The name speaks for itself. 2 Fast? 205 mph is way to fast for the street. 2 Real? It's incredible what takes place on public streets, (cops, tickets and more). For Hollywood? no actor or director could show the real drama and reality of street racing. The DVD's exclusive features includes Street Racing, getting busted by police, fast cars and fast women.
