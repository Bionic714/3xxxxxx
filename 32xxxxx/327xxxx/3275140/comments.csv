,carlitosv.1.0,2011-11-16T02:45Z,"Good work, and I thank the uploader for his efforts and compiling this pdf. A few notes: Book good for rhythm guitar, contains no solos. Also, I know ""I Should Have Known Better"" in the key of G, but in this book, its in the key of C.... if i'm not mistaken. :P Thanks!"
