I don't mind if someone is a gay but I hate when someone talks a shit like yours!

It was in 1994, the nice year which is noticeable for such a games like Doom II and the first Donkey Kong O_O

Tekken was the third real 3D fighting!

The first was a slo-mo like fight with scarecrows made of wooden bars - Viruta Fighter
The Second was Street Fighter EX. Which was EXtended to a 3rd demension the same Street Fighter II, and never was noticed until it add some shit to it's name several years ago (Super *** EX2 Plus Turbo)

And the third was Tekken, which became a role model for the rest of the 3D fightings that will come later.

So go and try (try to find it first) the ROMs for two of the first 3D Fightings and then come again and we'll discuss it all together"
