To most people Lee Evans is the goofy comic off the telly, but this film shows that there is more to Mr Evans than meets the eye.

He gives a superbly chilling performance as Sean Veil an acquitted murder suspect who films himself 24 hours a day every day, (the opening sequence shows him being woken by an alarm as he struggles to put a new tape in the camera). He's being chased by a police psychologist, two cops and an investigative reporter who all seem to have dark little secrets of their own.

The film comes to a dramatic and violent conclusion, so take someone with you it your easily scared.
