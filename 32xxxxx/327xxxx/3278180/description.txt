Frost is assigned to investigate a series of non-violent break-ins at the homes of elderly people for the purpose of theft, which does not excite his enthusiasm. Then there are a couple of brutal attacks on elderly women for seemingly no reason, which does get him energised. He knows that he has to catch the culprit before he kills again. WPC Wallace uncovers similarities with a series of attacks in Plymouth two years previously. Frost is helped by a newly-assigned female detective, DS Maureen Lawson, who also offers him advice on his personal life, as a consequence of which he invites Shirley Fisher out for dinner when they run into each other again at the hospital.
