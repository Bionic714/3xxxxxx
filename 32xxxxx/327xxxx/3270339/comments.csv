,Puremagic,2005-07-16T11:59Z,"to not forget the ever splendid games like
wastelands,pool of radiance and its sequels, bards tale (not the new version), darkknights of krynn and its sequels, buck rogers, rings of medusa, eye of the beholder etc etc."
,JPNox,2005-07-16T19:18Z,"IMHO Icewinds are one of the best by BI, I like them much more than Baldurs, but nevermind, Im now going to enjoy Nox"
,Moerkoe,2005-07-16T19:26Z,hmm.. theyre all pretty old.. what's the best of those?
,Moerkoe,2005-07-16T19:31Z,"now that i think about it, there were actually nice puzzles in icewinds.. but i think they lacked in atmosphere.."
