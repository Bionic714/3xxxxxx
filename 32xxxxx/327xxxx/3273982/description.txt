LAME @ alt-preset standard

While we're at it... here's FM's fourth album Aphrodisiac. After FM's disappointing third album 'Takin' it to the streets', this was something of a return to form for the band. 

AFAIK, this CD is out of print on its own, although it's available as part of the 3CD set 'Long Time No See':
