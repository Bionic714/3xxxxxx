Yet another small release, I didn't find any standalone forensic tools among the torrents so i thougt this one is good enough to be seeded. Please, don't use this tool if you don't know what it can do.....

From now on i will only upload torrents from time-to-time, don't have the time to spend with this anymore, if you see any release out there that you think look good, feel free to ask me if i have the time to upload it. Thx all for your great support that kept me going for a while more with my torrents.

For all you newcomers out there, make sure you always read the *.nfo file before installing anything. Do NOT complain to the seeder if you think it's lousy, blame the group that released it. Do NOT yell for seed, this is bittorrent technology, it can take a while. And most important! Keep seeding after you have downloaded a torrent!
