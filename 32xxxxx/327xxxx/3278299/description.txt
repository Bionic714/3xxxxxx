11-01-2005 fixed: Button scroller issues on homepage.
11-01-2005 added: Third rendering method using overlays. Added purely to help find the reason behind the quality improvements gained from the previous overlay method. This new method is identical to the previous overlays method, except it uses mplayers builtin YV12->YUY2 fast convertor. Further info will be available later today in the thread: http://www.xboxmediaplayer.de/cgi-bin/forums/ikonboard.pl?;act=ST;f=3;t=3916 NB: This output looks identical to my eyes as the output from the pixel shader.
11-01-2005 changed: Webserver authentication now defaults to BASIC instead of DIGEST. Solves Firefox issues.
10-01-2005 added: Second rendering method using overlays. Renderers can be switched from the GUI (Video Settings->Filters). Known Issues: 1080i may not be 100% in terms of Aspect ratio - it hasn't been tested. Renderers cannot be switched on the fly - change will take effect at next movie play. Overlays method is much slower than the pixel shader method - reason is mostly to do with the software YV12->YUY2 conversion done by mplayer.
