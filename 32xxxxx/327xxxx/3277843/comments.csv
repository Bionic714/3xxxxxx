,countborgia,2008-05-18T19:51Z,"Hey there, I am stuck at 91.8 but seeding that. We need the 100% to come in, then at least 1 person can keep seeding!!! - What is different about THIS folm and the other one? What was CUT from the movie? How long is this compared to the other ones? Anyone know? Meanwhile the normal (cut?) movie is on another torrent. - (Very surreal movie, characters live LONG after the movie is over. I am going there this summer. The original Bagdad Cafe was on the Route 66, but is not there. The one form the movie is NOT the original, but they filmed the movie there. The owner is fixing it up so it is even closer to the movie version. Should be good!)"

Please, seed!

Thanks!"

I've downloaded the 'bagdad.cafe.1987.uncut.dvdrip.xvid-imbt.avi' file from Emule network and resumed this torrent.

All files are OK.

Please, don't hit and run!

And enjoy this great film."
