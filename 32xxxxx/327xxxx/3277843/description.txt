Plot
Out of Rosenheim (Bagdad Cafe) is a look into the minds and lives of
some people most of us have met but few of us know much about. This
movie exemplifies how one person in the right place can affect a 
community of lives. The Adlons seem to express the view that all 
change and "magic" comes from hard work and mutual acceptance. A 
well-crafted view of the lives of tourists everywhere and the 
difficulties they can face. A Whimsical and lovingly Photographed 
look at the vast wasteland that is too often ignored by much of 
humanity.
