,mortalis,2006-03-09T01:16Z,"hey kluzz if you knew anything about acoustic alchemy you would know that ""Mr. Chow"" is on their best of album.  I don't know how much more random you can get than by making a selection off of their best of album for the ""best smooth jazz ever"" compilation.  Jackass."
