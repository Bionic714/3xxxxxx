,orione,2005-01-20T23:55Z,"I got:
Le Crime de Monsieur Lange (Jean Renoir, 1936)
Une Partie de Campagne [Jean Renoir](1936)
in French, no subbs

If you haven't seen La Grande Illusion, you will find it as one of those movies to be seen over and over again... There is not just masterful cinematography and great acting: there is a tremendous prophecy: done in 1937, two years later the world goes to war.....  "
,orione,2005-01-21T00:10Z,"P.S. I also got The Southerner, but i'ts a bad copy, and i must have somewhere The Golden Coach or Le Carrosse d'or ...
also, i am in the course of finishing La Bete Humain. "
,Pippin,2005-01-21T12:36Z,"I would be interested in each and everyone of them....The Golden Coach is from the Hollywood period, no? I think i read somewhere that those films were underrated but very good. In any case, thx!"
,Pippin,2005-01-21T12:49Z,"Oh, just saw there are no subtitles for Crime de Monsieur Lange and Partie de Campagne - and my french is a joke....Btw, is your regle du jeu the collection diamant edition? Thats the one I have. Just wondering if theres a 3rd edition besides this and the criterion."
,Beat,2005-01-21T13:22Z,"Ledsen ifall det är för mycket begärt, men jag skulle gärna vilja se denna som en DVD-9..."
,orione,2005-01-21T21:10Z,"hi Pippin, La regle.... i deleted by mistake, i am dl it now...haha.  
I will come by little by little with the other renoirs.

,pantherburn,2007-11-30T15:54Z,"VLC does not understand *.sub files, but it will work with *.srt files. You must rename the *.srt file to match the name of the *.avi file.  So, rename to 

La Grande Illusion 1937.srt  "
,jcwnah,2008-05-31T22:18Z,seed!  stuck at 99.98%

,Panzerfaust1974,2009-02-10T10:40Z,"Thanks a lot for this one, sir !! 
:)"
,timoiseau,2009-12-09T08:08Z,Thanks for sharing! :-)
,Amaximus,2010-01-01T20:34Z,Good copy - Criterion edition. Subs worked as well for iPod transcode. 
,AJNorth,2011-02-16T08:33Z,"With Joseph Goebbels having declared ""La Grande Illusion"" """"Cinematic Public Enemy No. 1,"" the Nazis burned every copy of the film they found as they advanced across Europe - except for one.

History has many ironies, and it turns out that the actual nitrate photographic negative was confiscated by a Nazi officer named [Dr.] Frank Hansel (a film archivist before the war), who smuggled it back to the Reichsfilmarchiv vaults - which happened to be in what became the Russian Zone of Berlin; when the Soviets discovered it in 1945, they removed the film to the Gosfilmofond film archive in Moscow, where it sat under virtually ideal conditions for almost twenty years, until it found its way back to the Toulouse CinÃ©mathÃ¨que, where it sat unnoticed for another thirty years in their nitrate collection until its discovery in the early 1990s, at which time a full restoration was undertaken.  In 1994, I saw a showing of a brand new print in a theater that still utilized a pair of Peerless carbon arc projectors."
,Morrissy,2011-08-05T16:27Z,"What the hell is with the subtitles?, theres only subtitles for certain parts so i have no idea whats going on. I want to watch a film not learn fucking french. HORRIBLE torrent."
,AJNorth,2011-08-19T07:13Z,"My default media player is the GOM Player (http://www.gomlab.com/eng/), which displays the subtitles exactly as seen watching the Criterion DVD of this film. The .srt file must either be in the same folder as the media file, or the file containing it specified, and subtitles must be enabled (it is also highly configurable). If one continues to have issues with subtitles, this might be a solution."
,humanbutonlyjust,2012-04-15T17:29Z,eng subs in torrent dont work entirely. these subs work http://subscene.com/english/The-Grand-Illusion-La-Grande-illusion/subtitle-244405.aspx
