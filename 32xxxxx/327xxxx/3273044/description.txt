A new drama about mediums. Haven't seen it yet... Copied from tvtome.com:

In this drama, Allison DuBois (Patricia Arquette, Stigmata, Flirting with Disaster) sees dead people - and in fact, she hears them constantly too. No, she's not crazy, although her husband Joe (Jake Weber, U-571), a rocket scientist, thought that was a possibility at first. So did Allison herself, until she realized that her "gift" could not only change fate -- but provide justice for those who no longer had a voice. Don't think Allison is totally comfortable with all of this -- in fact, she's as creeped out as everyone else. Imagine a dead father-in-law popping up unexpectedly at the foot of someone's bed. Plus, there are the jarring slices of disturbing crime scenes that pepper Allison's thoughts, added to her ability to sometimes know exactly what those around her (dead or alive) are thinking. Luckily, Allison has a great sense of humor along with her sixth sense. Even Joe, whose whole career is based on logic and fact, has become a bemused believer. The real challenge is convincing law enforcement agencies around the country that Allison is the real deal.

NOTE: With the success of real "mediums" on TV: Crossing Over with John Edward, Between Worlds with Michelle Whitedove, and Psychic Detectives, this drama will be another venue for mainstream America to realize that religion only gives us part of the answer. There are those who live among us that have the rare ability to communicate with the 'other side'.
