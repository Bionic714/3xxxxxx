These albums does not come from a serious release. I don't remember from where I got them. Which explains why one of the song is in 128kbps.

I saw a request for these albums and made a torrent. If anyone has a better release, please share, and let me know so I can remove this one.

Since there already are 5 different torrents for the new album I didn't include it in this torrent. ;oP

...enjoy and don't forget to help seed! :o)
