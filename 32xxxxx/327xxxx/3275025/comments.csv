,pederbc,2005-01-11T13:16Z,"I have downloaded all episodes separately and then authored them on DVD with Nero. The next DVD is just being ""torrented""."
,Xarko,2005-01-11T16:14Z,nån som kan seeda? sånt här är för bra för att försvinna så fort
,p7389,2005-01-11T17:14Z,Could somebody possible comment on the quality of the visual?
,agent86,2005-01-11T18:27Z,"Yeah, I would like to know about the quality before downloading. Ten episodes per disc sounds like a lot, not to mention the source is probably low grade AVI or MPEG2. Actually, I just convinced myself. I'll pass."
,Xarko,2005-01-11T22:45Z,thanks a lot
,voxac30tb,2005-01-13T16:58Z,Nån som kan seeda?

,linty,2005-01-16T21:24Z,You are a true hero
,linty,2005-01-16T22:54Z,"I hate to ask, but what do i do with these files once i've downloaded them?  I've never burned a dvd out of vobs, bups and ifos before."
,pederbc,2005-01-17T15:30Z,"To burn VOB's etc, use NERO, choose DVD video, and place all files in the VIDEO_TS folder, and burn!"
,meatwaad,2005-08-01T07:18Z,"I dont like video quality with these 5 DVDR. Videos are just 352x480 and with *watermark* in upper left corner. Its really a waste of DVDR capacity for such a low quality videos. Instead you should download 10GB or 7GB torrents:
