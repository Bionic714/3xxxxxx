,LalaTorrent,2005-01-08T10:52Z,I'm seeding as much as possible.
,Greaver,2005-02-10T10:43Z,how tha fuck do you get this to work... ive opened it with daemon tools but nothing happens... theres no .exe file that you can use...
,plojoch,2005-04-11T19:41Z,Kan nån seeda?
,plojoch,2005-04-12T07:01Z,Hur ska man göra för att få de att fungera?
,martin.agren,2006-01-15T12:45Z,Seeda är ni snälla
,Cowboy.657,2006-01-23T06:30Z,Same problem as Greaver... there is no .exe file. It appears to just be folder after folder of data files without the program to run them?? Anyone get this thing to work properly?
,silenius,2006-03-15T19:26Z,I guess it needs igrafx process I'm still downloading it though
,silenius,2006-03-16T02:00Z,you need to download http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3273322 and install it then mount the latin CD in DAEMON tools or any mounting program
,Volsen,2006-05-04T10:01Z,"So let me get this straight, Rosetta Stone is a brand name and has nothing to do with the actual rosetta stone?  I see.  You does this compare with your standard pimsleur language pack?"
,hrdnox,2006-06-07T19:27Z,"You have to have the Rosetta Stone Application program, it's a manager for all your language discs.

Download the Application, then use Alcohol 120 to burn your language discs to a cd. I've had problems with Greek I and II but my french and russian prgs work fine.

Good luck."

[V],cezen,2008-01-24T00:39Z,"Worked like a charm.  Downloaded.  I have ultra iso which you can get here or anywhere really.  right mouse click on the latin iso file and select mount to drive G: ( at least it is what my letter was) and then open your previously downloaded rosetta stone application and it shows as the language disc!  WOOHOO thanks for posting a GOOD copy of this.  not a virus laden, cheap hack of the free demo disc from rosetta stone!

,Milkywaycenter,2008-08-01T04:25Z,More fucking crap!
,Mike727,2008-10-12T17:33Z,"I've downloaded two different v2 language iso's, and I can't get either of them to work. I've tried mounting them and I've tried burning them, but whenever I open RS, it just tells me to insert the correct cd rom. I installed the prog from a friend's store-bought disc. Is there a patch for v2 to work with iso's?"
,fripper01,2008-10-18T08:32Z,"Fantastic,worked with no problem under linux mount with a loopback as a disk and install under wine. Well worth the time to dl.
"
,faceleg,2008-10-18T09:40Z,"Anyone happen to know from where one could download Latin v3?

Sadly v2 language packs do not work with the new version of RS."
,Jamaica_1,2009-01-06T22:03Z,"works fine...Downloaded ""The Rosetta Stone - Latin - Level I - Units 1-8 iso"", open with daemon tools and burn to a CD. After that download ""http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3273322"" then mount it with daemon tools. go into my computer rigth click the image icon (beside the dvd drive icon) and select ""EXPLORE"" run the setup and ur good to go."
,arsenal0119,2009-03-28T21:30Z,Can anyone find latin level 2. Having an extremely hard time finding.
,hg22,2009-05-03T20:35Z,"@Skagman: Supposedly, it's based off learning things my immersion, not translation. I haven't tried it yet though...I'm downloading it at the moment."
,l3viathan,2009-05-15T13:55Z,"@ arsenal0119:

There is no Level 2 for Latin:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone_(software)#Packages

@ faceleg:
So far, there is no Version 3 for Latin either:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone_(software)#Languages

And I can confirm that this V2 torrent doesn't work with V3 software."
,mskim1989,2009-05-16T20:24Z,"thanks,  i will seed until the world learns the lang of the dead"
,ikweethetwel,2009-07-29T09:13Z,"I would very much like to have the new V3 Latin Level 1,2 and 3 http://www.rosettastone.com/learn-latin/level-1-2-3 .

Does anyone know where to get it?"
,sdeloney,2009-12-09T04:42Z,"Yeah, according to the RS website, they made a Latin for V3... will seed it till the day I die if someone uploads the torrent"
,Ethan211,2010-01-16T17:06Z,"http://www.filestube.com/f21d199154565e9803e9,g/Latin-V3-Level-1.html

Hopefully this is authentic..."
,forsaken1111,2010-01-27T09:09Z,"I tried that link and it is the V2 Latin software, not the V3."
,Lord_Mordred,2010-04-15T06:34Z,"1.0 mb/s go baby go, Cheers!"
,setari,2010-06-10T06:09Z,This doesn't work with V3? Well fuck.
[T],MrDowntown,2010-06-25T02:04Z,"I thought thought RS 3.4.5 was reverse compatible? Does this language work on the new program???

Please someone upload LATIN V3.... AMABO TE!!!!"
[T],MrDowntown,2010-06-25T02:29Z,Version 3.4.5 does not see this as a language disc... sad day
,some-young-guy,2010-08-02T06:03Z,"After mounting it, how do I run the program?  What is SWA format?"
,johnmcarr,2010-10-06T21:41Z,"@some-young-guy:  .swa is the file extension for ""Shockwave Object"" (one of the rivals to Adobe Flash, actually.)  You have to have Macromedia Shockwave installed on your computer in order to use it."
,hettinger,2011-02-13T03:07Z,DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE THE V3 LEVELS 1-3 ARE?  PLEASSSEEEE!
,Doomlar,2011-05-28T21:24Z,"For anybody that needs Latin for V3, the link is here:
