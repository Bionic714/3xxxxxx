,piraten.,2005-07-13T08:40Z,"O'Reilly, ah oreilly. Great ebooks, and the exotic animals that they come up with to put on their covers always give me a laugh. They must be running out of animals by now lol. You can always count on me to be seeding like hell on everything I download.. Pirate Bay must never go under! I will send a donation sometime, because TPB owns."

,Don_C,2006-08-30T18:28Z,"The books are all fairly out of date. For example, the Apache guide is for v1.3 which is not worth learning about considering v2.2 is out. Anyway, thanks for the effort."
,kool_buddy,2008-01-04T04:26Z,"thanks a lot ....guys please keep seeding, I will seed too when the download completes.
