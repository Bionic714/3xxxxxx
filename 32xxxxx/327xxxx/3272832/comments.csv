,darth,2005-07-29T23:33Z,"Thx for these - time to step into the way back machine.

For all you guys trying to figure out how to run these - burn/extract/mount the .iso file.  Pick a game.  Unzip the files for that game.  Now you have a bunch of options.

The easiest would be to pull out your 386 or 486 box running DOS, copy the files over there and go.  If you are like me and have a DOS partition you could boot to DOS and run some of them, but some games go nuts with the speeds of todays machines.  You could try to run the games in MS DOS mode in Win 98, or even on 2k/XP usually with less success.

But if you don't have access to a DOS box and want the least screwing around download dosbox (DOS emulator) and figure out how to use it.

Turning into a long post - this supposed ancient virus doesnt even register on my scanner.  Which file(s) do you guys think is infected?"
,Vizla,2005-07-30T15:45Z,"Stop crying about the ""virus""... Its just a freakin code wich copies itself to u'r .com files.. It's not doing any harm anyways. ( Since the server it sends the information to dissapeared like 3-4 years ago.. )"

older games are smaller. (i used to have a 720kb floppy with 14 games on it).

if any of these games are infected by a virus (its probably just newer AV programs that freaks out when games use realmode code) it would only affect dos anyway (i assume noone uses dos anymore :))

You see, children, back before everybody was attached to their cell phone (when the DeLorean was cool not just because it was on Back to the Future), very few people had computers.  The people who did have computers didn't have the powerhouses we have today, but rather 33 MHz 486's (though the DeLorean was tied to Back to the Future by then).

What I'm trying to get at here, kiddos, is that some people may have nostalgic feelings towards some or all of these games.  And because said games are rather old, it's not at all unreasonable that they all fit into a 600 Mb file.  

It seems like yesterday when I bragged to my friends at school about having a 200 Mb hard drive..."

,Pfc_biggins,2006-08-27T11:07Z,"Top notch torrent!!! What a great way to take me back 15 years. Now I am only 22 but started playing these games when I was around 7 so quit with the remarks about just old people loving these great classics. If a lot of these games were never created we would not have a ton of the games we do today. Classics like the Ultima series, Star Control, Bards Tale, Wolfenstein 3D, The Perfect General, and many many more were a foundation for the future of gaming. Even today I still play these abandoned games on a regular basis. Back when graphics for a game were lacking the programers made up for it by spending more time on the story and gameplay. You little children out there that run around thinking your a gamer have a lot to learn because a true gamer can appreciate the old as well as the new. Heres to you Lord British!"

And for those who have no respect for old school pc games have no respect for themselves. Besides most of the new games are bullshit- i rather play some old stuff which is interesting then some new crap- it is not about the graphics it´s about the story the idea and all the other small details which  makes a game good game.

,bizzarefoods,2006-09-04T02:58Z,Ok this works. Some games you might have trouble with  but most work. like some one said you can basicly get a emulator and make them alll work great. NO VURIS checked with norton 06! 007 no work for me : ( o well im only 13 but love anything on dos stupid microsoft why did the have to make windows DOS is much better... i laugh though at how these passed at great graphisc 
,Pfc_biggins,2006-09-08T09:40Z,"As far as the supposed virus on this torrent:

Some virus scanners will not be able to find the two that are in it. This is because the viruses are as old as the games included. They can not effect any computer running windows millenium or better. The viruses attach to dos files and would corrupt them. Because computers do not use Dos as an operating system any more they can not effect your computer.

Now if you have partioned your computer so that you can install a version of Dos or intend to move these games over to an older computer, you will need to remove the virus using AVG or an older version of Norton. (AVG is free and has no problem finding and removing the two files.

Now then, I hope this clears it up for everybody that keeps posting crap about there being a problem with this wonderful collection of classics."

,Mrs.Lecter,2006-09-12T22:01Z,"Fy fan va sjysst broshan,"
,WiiFisher,2006-09-18T08:58Z,"Well reading these comments sure was fun.  Wish I could be there when these widjit kiddies who don't get the nostalgia get dissed by their own kids for longingly wanting to play some ""ancient"" XBox360 crap, rather than some ""new fangled"" Lenovo (the Chinese ARE going to take over the world after all, you know) ""HoloStation 10""-based mind-numb crap.

It took originality and creativity to create games that were worthwhile on these old systems, instead of the same old tired clichés done over and over ad infinitum as is the case today.  Everything was new ground back then and so you were welcome to try anything you could imagine back then.  Programs were most commonly written by just one or two people, whereas now it requires entire groups made up of sub-groups called ""teams"" that each specialize in some small part of the overall design - the entire group has to have the same vision and individuality is not welcome (al la 1984).

Nowadays a stupid ""Hello, world"" program requires more RAM to run than my 5KB VIC-20 (with only about 3.5KB of that actually available for use) contained in its most expanded state (about 36KB with the 32KB expansion cartridge - which I never had since it cost nearly as much as the computer itself).  That's right kiddies -  we actually actually had more fun with less RAM than came on the original Pentium's level 1 cache!

Simple answer for ya kiddies: if ya don't know how to use these already then don't bother trying - once you find out how much you have to learn just to get them going (then actually see them and compare them to the games you're used to) then you'll just give up in disgust anyway, much like the rest of the kiddies here who just don't get it.  Move along now and leech some other game that has hidden nude scenes and takes WAY more disk space than it's worth - it's all you really want anyway."

,WiiFisher,2006-09-21T07:28Z,"Children - fight nicely, please.

DragonM - 2GB hasn't typically been referred to with regard to hard disk size since before the new millenium.  Any ""pro"" would know that (and that ""now"" is not the same word as ""know""), and that you are most certainly NOT a pro.

HOWEVER, I will give you HALF-credit on the CPU speed issue -- it is true that there is no OFFICIALLY SHIPPING 4GHz CPU.  A simple Google search reveals plenty of overclocking mods that will get you there, however."
,bassee__,2006-09-21T18:36Z,é deta nba streetv3 ?
,WiiFisher,2006-09-22T09:13Z,"Oh, and one other thing, DragonM -- comparing the speed of the PS3's Cell CPU  to an x86-based processor just further proves that YOU HAVE NO FLIPPING IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!!!

Despite what my screen name implies (something I chose before Nintendo pissed out the official name for the Revolution console -- they shoulda just stuck with the original), I'm not much of a gaming system person and yet even I know about the PS3 using IBM's Cell processor (basically a multi-core (9 of 'em, I think?) PowerPC processor, if I understand correctly).

Comparing the clock speed of such vastly differing CPUs is just plain an act of COMPLETE IDIOCY!  The way the processors work is ENTIRELY different - they use different instruction sets, have different pipeline structures, use different buses, and heck - I think they even look at memory addresses differently (little-endian vs. big-endian).

Just another illustration that you had better be damned certain of what you're talking about before you open yer trap and not only attempt to speak authoritatively upon a subject, but slap down someone else for doing the same."

,Pfc_biggins,2006-09-29T06:44Z,"WiiFisher great response to the moron!

Just thought I would add that In addition to microprocessors, the speeds of buses and interfaces are also measured in MHz. 

Now saying your computer is 2GB, that just leaves the door WIDE open as to what you are refering to.

Now DragonM, I hope that you have enough common sense to know that a Gigabyte is just a whole crap load of bytes. A byte (Abbreviation for binary term,) is a unit of storage capable of holding a single character. On almost all modern computers, a byte is equal to 8 bits. Large amounts of memory are indicated in terms of kilobytes (1,024 bytes), megabytes (1,048,576 bytes), and gigabytes (1,073,741,824 bytes). 

Now with that being said. There are multiple computer components that are measured in bytes. I.E. Video Cards, Sound Cards, RAM, Removable Storage Devices, Etc... (Not that you will find a 2GB Sound Card anytime soon.)

So in the future please don't bad mouth someone if you too don't know what the hell your talking about.

(Oh and FYI  WiiFisher, you were close with the PS3 Stats. It will actually have nine processor cores in it. Not that its going to get me to buy one, Down with the consoles!)"

my myself all these generation of games on a Amiga 500. 8 mhz CPU no HD, U could use a HD of 20 MB (very very ver expensive).  The PC (286) didn´t even have a soundcard at this time. 

The most amazing was that ATARI and AMIGA had a seperate handling if graphic. It took severel years to find a 3D card for PC so the PC CPU had to handle graphic too. 

When the PC 486 generation came the PC started to be a gaming machine.

Yes a great game for Atari and Amiga was under 1 meg. After a while the launched games with huge graphic spawned over up to 24 discs (dragons Lair as I remembered).   "

to all ignorants:
1. no need for a good game to use state-of-the- art tech
2. most gamers used to laugh when some1 tried to combine the word PC and GAME
3. To arnelax: 286 generation had soundcard (even my8086 did) 
4. The first card was was ADlib (no sampling - 11 channels FM synthesis) and then came (thank God) Soundblaster (same details with sampling)
5. Amiga 500 has a very special equipment called blitter (hardware scrolling accleration). Atari St didnt
6. Atari ST though was better for midi
7. EGA and VGA offered better analysis and VGA better colour pallete. Hercules and CGA disappeared very soon.
8. HD was extra. A 20 MB hd offered plenty space
9. KIDS: some very classics (respect) Defender of the Crown, Art of War, Phantasie III, Double Dragon, Test Drive Series, Kings and Space Quest Series (long live ken and robert williams - Sierra on line), Nebulus, Wing Commander (fucken brilliant) --and for Amiga 500 Shadow of the Beast (18 levels of scrolling from a 8 Mzh CPU-- respect to Psygnosis)"

,ursak,2007-12-26T12:36Z,You really think that the viruses written for old doc computers can do any harm onn an 32 or 64 bit machine? lol
,Sakado,2008-01-09T14:21Z,Umm... There pretty much stuff in this torrent..And if there is virus.. well They cant touch this..

,freakyfireflies,2008-03-12T02:48Z,This is frickin sweet. Love it!! Thank You!! There is a decade of a generation gap between me and and my 2 younger siblings so they wouldn't recognize any of these but I grew up playing them. Thanks and Peace! 
,Sicrea,2008-03-12T21:44Z,"No matter your specs. Your machine is obsolete.

Obsolecensce is a fact of life, computer life.

There it will be a time when the childrens will say. ""...Did you play that awful looking game Crysis..."". or  ""...Damm old timer to play Halo 3 you have to use the hands.... yuckss..."".

Nevermind, somethings will never change, there it will be always a new batch of old timers. this torrent was posted 4 years ago and still Running. in the mean time Micro$oft released a free version of virtual PC 2004 and a comercial of virtual PC 2007. Get those instead of dosbox are simplier, better,compatible and more important are for the windows generation of users.

I have a top notch (or a piece of crap depending on WHEN you are reading) athlon dual core X64 running XPpro  64 bits and Q-berts is running happy.

Since then, i win a 3 bucks auction for a PCI TNT video card for the TV out. WHOO those cards use to cost an arm and a leg. XP takes the card as second monitor under virtualization everything works great.

In case a file is infected si not a big deal. I hope you will not plan  calculate the payrole in DOS, so  just delete the virtual machine. Literaly you can have hundreds of VMs in a 250 Gigs drive.

So forget about dosbox and get the virtual PC instead. In my opinion a low res game looks  better on a low res device like the TV. 

Getting a real machine for pennies  plus shipping, is real. You can`t lose or at least cost much less than a single ""modern"" game that in the end is boring."
,emo-batty-boy,2008-06-19T20:55Z,"you dont have to be an old gen gamer to enjoy these games, im still young, and i remember being completely addicted to electroman when i was young.
i never completed it though. :(

please seed, im not getting any speed at all."
,NosTraDomus,2008-07-04T03:28Z,"Crysis...whats that? lol

even if its an OLD game, it could be a new worm...trojan..something hidden, that would cause a 32bit system to freak out or crash...but thats nothing new there, MS has already done that for windows based pc users, but 64bit is harder, crysis, lol thats funny, i liked the Nukes..i liked playing as that Mother alien walker thing, you need a mod to play it, but its nice and freaky..."
,Evil..Muffin,2008-09-04T21:46Z,"i'm a newbie 

can any1 tell me how i can finally play the games? i've downloaded it...
and now?"
,breon,2008-10-23T22:06Z,"Crysis is overrated anyway. It starts out good, but then gets boring as hell. Wandering around corridors with virtually nothing to do is in my mind, boring."
,bubalanimi,2008-11-06T21:21Z,does the stargate game work?
,D0ttten,2009-01-10T09:53Z,Seed ? : )
,jarooko,2009-03-20T08:20Z,"   I think you can't even call Crysis a game... It represents a ""what-a-good-graphic-designer-could-do-if-you-pay-him-well"" game, soulless and boring..."
,oswin58,2009-06-10T09:44Z,lots of virus My pc is Fucked up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! do not download.......
