Laurence Burrell, an autistic young man, is the only witness to an attack on a security guard at Denton Quarry, but he claims that aliens were responsible. Superintendent Mullett asks Frost to investigate a series of burglaries on homes that have been recently occupied, and drafts him in some help, in the form of Det Sgt Hazel Wallace, who sometimes has to bring her new baby Emma into work. Frost is also suspicious about the link between a local takeaway delivery service and another series of burglaries. Then a seven-year old child of divorced parents goes missing, and the father is unable to account convincingly for his whereabouts in the hours afterwards. Frost wonders if there is a coincidental link between him and the first series of burglaries. Meanwhile, his suspicions are growing about what is happening behind the scenes at the quarry, and how it relates to a proposed large development in the area that would include it.
