,orgpunk,2005-01-03T15:45Z,"nikserof are you retarded or are you using the pirate bay for the first time?
You can never se the seeder from the start. it takes at least an hour. And you can also read on top of indexpage ""The site might be somewhat slow, as we suddenly got a huge jump in traffic...""
You can also read more about how this work on the pirate bay and you can use a searchengine.
So stop acting like a mongoloid."
,orione,2005-01-03T16:55Z,"yes indeed... problems connecting to the tracker... i am tuned to it though, don't despair :-) "

,pojoel,2005-01-07T00:19Z,"Yup. But then again, it's not an A-B-C-1-2-3 crime-carchase-bang-bang-die-yamothafukka-movie where you get everything in the non-existent plot explained three times and spoonfed now, is it? 
You have to remember that there is an audience for vanDamme-movies too..."

,bhobson333,2008-01-04T18:09Z,"Sorry, Hysteriko.  I DL'ed this movie last week and quit seeding (and have since deleted the file) for these reasons:

1)  My ratio was good & there were several other seeders

2)  I wasn't happy with the video quality

3)  A friend loaned me the DVD.  I am currently seeding the DVD image here:

,shakewell,2008-03-19T05:06Z,"I saw this about ten years ago  I think the story is profound. The food sex scenes were superflouous. Food as a metaphor for life. It reminds me of David Ogilvy's Confessions of an Advertising Man, where he reveals that everything he knows about advertising agencies, he learned while working in a french kitchen. The protagonist's quest for the perfect noodle shop brings an important message to us all."
,shakewell,2008-03-19T05:09Z,"Profound story, food as a metaphor for life. The quest for a perfect noodle kitchen leads a proprietor through a fascinating storyline. Superfluous sex scenes involve the use of food, especially raw eggs. David Ogilvy, in his Confessions of an Advertising Man, said he learned everything he knows about success while prep working in a French kitchen."
