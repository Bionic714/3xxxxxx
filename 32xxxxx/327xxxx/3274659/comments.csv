,digitalhax,2005-02-02T23:46Z,This torrent appears to contain both the movie (avi) and a rar file containing the avi so it looks like you download the movie twice.  Can someone who has already downloaded check this for me so I can deselect the file if necessary? -thx
,digitalhax,2005-02-03T05:06Z,nevermind :-P
,Kraigel,2005-04-15T20:59Z,seeda!
,CMOTDibbler,2005-07-23T03:41Z,"digitalhax put your glasses back on mate, the .RAR is measured in Kb the avi is measured in Mb! The RAR is obviously one of the two subtitle files. "

Even though I have been seeding some of these movies regularly for years, the number of seeds never seems to increase. Come on people! This is file sharing, not file taking! You all need to take the load off me and help out with seeding."
