WebExe enables you to convert a single HTML page, or group of pages, into one single, self-running EXE file with an integrated browser.

Includes a detailed Help system and an electronic assistant, to guide you through all stages, right up to the creation of your output file. The WebExe wizard simplifies what could otherwise be a complicated task.

The opportunities are almost endless with WebExe, yet the final output is completely under your control. For example, you can set the size of the output browser window and have full control over the appearance of menu bars, restrict functionality such as printing and copying, and so much more.

The output file is created using one named start page, and from there, all embedded graphics, sounds and linked pages, are compiled into one single file. This way, a complete web site is worked through by WebExe, and all files are collected and compressed using the ZIP algorithm."
