Oh the stupidity of humanity!!!"

,corzoogler,2005-01-20T20:33Z,"I presumed he was simply drawing attention to the fact that, at least in that image, Arthur appears to have rather large, and dare I say it, shapely, breasts."

,Vinternatten,2005-01-26T08:23Z,"Could not get the avi-file to work, all media players just ""need to close"" after running it. What did I do wrong?"
,croaker-bc,2005-01-28T22:43Z,"What player are you using ? Are you certain you have the XVID codec installed ?
Try playing with Zoomplayer (http://www.inmatrix.com/files/zoomplayer_download.shtml).
If you need the xvid codec, go to http://www.free-codecs.com/ to download it."
