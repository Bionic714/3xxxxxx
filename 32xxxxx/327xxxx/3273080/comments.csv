[T],TheTeaher,2005-01-05T14:29Z,To my knowledge it is a modified trial-version that makes it a real live version.
,Rabbithead,2005-03-29T12:07Z,Is there any chance someone could seed this? I've been looking EVERYWHERE for it and this is the only one I've found. Thanks in advance! :)

TheTeaher I would love you forever if you can reseed or reupload this. Seriously, it would save my ass. I know it's fucking year 2011 and this was posted in 2005, but if you're out there and happen to still have the files, PLEASE UPLOAD THEM. Thanks, mate!"
