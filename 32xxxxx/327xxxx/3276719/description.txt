It is the week before the World Championships of Poker. Three young professional players have teamed up to take down Don "The Matador" Everest, played by Michael Madsen (Vengeance Unlimited, Reservoir Dogs). The Matador is the most powerful and influential player on tour. He is the reigning champion of poker and his presence is well felt.

The team of 3-- Eddie (Eddie Cibrian- Third Watch), Miami (Kristin Lehman- Judging Amy), and Clark (Todd Williams- Third Watch)-- struggle to gain the upper hand and along the way, encounter the real world of the professional gambler.

The casino is owned by Lowball, played by Don McManus (NYPD Blue). Chris Bauer (Third Watch, Law & Order) plays Nickel, a maniac, law enforcing gambler, out for blood revenge.

Set in Las Vegas' Colorado Casino, the series will show the fast lifestyle of the professional Vegas gambler. From the back rooms to the card table, past wounds will be reopened and fortunes will be wagered. The future of the game is at stake.
