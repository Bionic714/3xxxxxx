,mskjold85,2007-09-10T23:12Z,"IG2 won't work with nvidia drivers older than 5***. JoWood will not reease a patch fixing this problem for some reason. Anyways, you can still play it if you're using ATI chips or have an ""older"" gfx card."
,borisv55,2007-10-26T00:21Z,Me have ati9550GE 256 mb ram and still game doesn't work :(

,MasterJJ23,2008-07-27T21:01Z,"Torrent is no good. It is a bogus file, everytime you go to start the game it says something in another language and restarts the computer.
 I have done games before so I know what I am talking about most of thie time and I would tell everyone to not waist you're time on this piece of $hit torrent."
