I recently decided to stop seeding this and all other albums due to the fact that Piratebay users simply don't seed or care about ratios at all. I will make another try in maybe a month from now at best with a new album. I'm sorry, but the only one you can blame is probably yourself.




Today I seed the seventh out of 7 (9 albums, fixed 2 more) Depeche Mode albums I currently have as Flac. For the upcoming week there'll be one new Depeche album every day. So stay tuned =)

Note that FLAC is NOT a lossy format such as Mp3s which might injur your HiFi equipment badly. FLAC is nothing but the best and without all the DRM enabled crap Apple and Microsoft push out these days.

If you don't know about FLAC or why it is the future, head over to http://flac.sf.net and get convinced yourself.

AMG Review by Ned Raggett

Martin Gore has famously noted that Depeche Mode stopped worrying about its future when the first post-Clarke-departure single, "See You," placed even higher on the English charts than anything else Vince Clarke had done with them. Such confidence carries through all of Frame, a notably more ambitious effort than the pure pop/disco of the band's debut. With arranging genius Alan Wilder still one album away from fully joining the band, Frame became very much Gore's record, writing all the songs and exploring various styles never again touched upon in later years. "Satellite" and "Monument" take distinct dub/reggae turns, while "Shouldn't Have Done That" delivers its slightly precious message about the dangers of adulthood with a spare arrangement and hollow, weirdly sweet vocals. Much of the album follows in a dark vein, forsaking earlier sprightliness, aside from tracks like "A Photograph of You" and "The Meaning of Love," for more melancholy reflections about love gone wrong as "Leave in Silence" and "My Secret Garden." More complex arrangements and juxtaposed sounds, such as the sparkle of breaking glass in "Leave in Silence," help give this underrated album even more of an intriguing, unexpected edge. Gore's lyrics sometimes veer on the facile, but Gahan's singing comes more clearly to the fore throughout -- things aren't all there yet, but they were definitely starting to get close.
