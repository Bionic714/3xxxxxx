,Temptation,2005-01-11T08:30Z,"Just finished watching this and wanted to say thanks for the movie.  This is a small, intimate indie film... no big explosions or expensive CGI or dumb action heroes.. just a simple slice of life.. with moments of joy and sadness.. with good acting and some touching moments.  Thank you for this, once again."
