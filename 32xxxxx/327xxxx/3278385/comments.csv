One amazing thing: the unprobable casting of Heston delivers... 
The scene at the beginning is one of the most starling scenes of all times.  
Quinlan is a villain, but all the sympathy goes to him... he is one of best villain ever."
,Pippin,2005-01-18T15:22Z,"Yes, its great. I think its his most accomplished film, though I havnt seen Chimes At Midnight, which some say is his crowning achievement. I hope to get it real soon though....

Youre right that Heston (otherwise the most wooden actor in Hollywood) gives a good performance - Quinlan is the money though. Hes got character (which you might say Vargas has not) and that makes the film ambiguous, in my opinion. Or Welles is ambiguous about him."

,orione,2005-01-23T01:25Z,I hope the Swiss don't get offended....Welles is not so nice to them back at the Prater.... hehehe
,Pippin,2005-01-23T11:49Z,"The swiss said in response to the film that the cuckoo clocks were made in Bavaria, not Switzerland....leaves you to wonder if 500 years of democracy accomplished anything at all...."

,slbm70,2008-04-14T05:30Z,thankyou very much. Works wonderfully
,ergot,2008-06-29T03:31Z,"Is this the theatrical version, or Orson Wells' director's cut?  There are like 76 changes between the two versions, and I would prefer to get another copy of the director's cut if possible (mine is a VHS TVrip and is messed up during the climactic final scene).

Thanks for the up!"
