Pistol Opera

"Number-three-killer, Stray Cat (Mikijiro Hira), is a cocky up-start assassin for the Guild, which is an International organization of assassins that keep the world under control. Stray Cat dreams of the #1 spot as the most sought after assassin, but is constantly seduced and belittled by her operator, a mysterious woman who wears a purple veil around her face. So when Stray Cat is sent on an assignment to kill &#8220;Hundred Eyes&#8221;, another assassin from the Guild who has gone rouge, she is thrilled at the opportunity as it just so happens that &#8220;Hundred Eyes&#8221; holds the #1 spot of assassins. But there is just one minor problem in completing her mission - no one really knows who Hundred Eyes is or knows what he looks like since the better assassins are more elusive. . ."
