OK here's No Fun At All and the Donots from the Taubertal Festival. No Fun At All were one of the best bands to come out Sweden, if you like Bad Religion or No Use For A Name etc then you will love them. The Donots are a great live band from Germany, they are mixture of skate punk, Beatsteaks, Autopilot Off etc. I will be posting full TV shows by both bands soon, so this is a chance to check them out first, enjoy!

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
