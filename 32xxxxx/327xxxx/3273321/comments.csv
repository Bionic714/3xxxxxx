,L337ish,2010-01-12T10:06Z,"For those who don't know how to get their language packs added. 

This may not be the L337 way to do it, but mine works fine and this is how I added it.


1. Download a program such as MagicISO, PowerISO, DaemonTools, etc.

2. Install a virtual cd drive. This can be done by right clicking an iso file, going to MagicISO(or whatever you installed), and choosing the appropriate option to add a driver.

3. Once you have a virtual driver, right click the iso, go to your virtual driver, and ""mount""

4.If you installed Rosetta Stone properly, which can be tricky depending on your download, open it up and add the language from there."
,8Yoshi8,2011-10-08T20:28Z,"These language packs are for v.2 Rosetta Stone. If you have the updated v.3, they won't work. Unfortunately I couldn't find any v.3 Thai .iso, so I had to download a complete language pack with like 25 languages just to get Thai. You may need to do the same if you're running v.3."
