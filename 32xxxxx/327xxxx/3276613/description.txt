This is the ultimate rockumentary about the greatest deathpunk band in the world! 


Ascending From Darkness ... 

In early december 2001 - almost 3 years after their split - Turbonegro's sensational "res-erection" began with an out of the blue announcement of their participation in the Quart Festival held in Kristiansand, Norway. Soon two more shows were confirmed for the summer of 2002 at the Swedish Hultsfred and the German Bizarre Festival. Their number of fans had grown substantially in the meantime and all of these shows were a huge success, an overwhelming welcome and celebration of Turbonegro's return to the rock'n'roll ring. 

Disc 2 contains a selection of live material from the 3 Res-erection shows (mainly Quart festival) plus more assorted & unseen footage from the vaults beginning in the pre-Turbo years of 1987 with De Dype, more live cuts from shows in Norway spanning the years 89-98 with all the different lineups plus appearances on Swedish & Norwegian television where among others Hank shows the host how to handle the ass-rocket!!!
