,killine,2007-03-02T05:23Z,"is this a joke or something. With a so little file in mb you should seed it at least once, I can't imagine that this wouldn't be any thing else than extreme popular in the morrowind community, so if this is right, shre it at least to one person. It would seed it 24/7 if  I got the chanche to get it down on my computer, so please SEED once and I shall do it for you after that. Anyway, I have to see it before I belive it"
