Awesome stuff!
I've been searching for this album in lossless format for a long time!"
,KGP2005,2006-02-26T11:20Z,Do you have the LIVE album allso??
,Teoulas,2006-08-16T20:52Z,"Awesome, thanks :)"
,phound,2007-06-28T19:08Z,"Flaccube, thanks for your uploads, but don't be such a hard ass about seeding.  Lots of people are new to bittorrent and are very familiar with ratio ettiquette.  Even more people are clueless as to the virtues of flac, so there are less seeder/leechers for your torrents to begin with.  That said, hope you have a change of heart and start seeding again and will continue releasing great DM classics."

cheers"
,traxtenberg,2008-12-10T19:52Z,"I only remove torrents from seeding if ratio is at least 1.3. if I like thing, and do not need to move it/rename - then of course for more. hope others do the same"
