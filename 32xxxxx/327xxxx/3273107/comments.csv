,ilive4harleys,2007-10-02T05:30Z,"Considering the current administration, I honestly believe that this TV administration could do a better job than Bush and Co. And in case anyone is wondering, yes I am American (but I didn't vote for Bush so don't blame me)."

,ebud,2010-04-22T21:48Z,"Hi,
download is pretty slow for this one and I would appreciate if you, other peer, could just open the valve a little more on the upload side - like I do (I'm set on a preset DSL (fast) mode on my client and the upload rate says 40kB/sec max.... Ă do my share, please do yours)
however, Thx a lot for the release and sharing. that's a good show, also as for a french-Canadian (not a dumb one, ok ;P ), to get a glimpse on the US politic scene :)
Speakin nation-wise, most french canadian would like to remind all americans that We Are Not French from France but Canadians and we are still helping your Forces in ruthless foreign countries (lots of french canadians supporting in there too!)... and most well-educated one of us enjoy america as much as you do, cuz it's a great wide country with lots of differences from North to South and East to West
Finally, if you follow the US/CAN/Mexico Gov. agenda, you'll find out that we're all gonna be in a big North Am.Union soon. Watch it happen, as you see this and breathe deeper... just google Trans-America Highway for fun... it's just a beggining! I'm pretty excited about it, exceptionally for travellin purposes."
