Frost investigates two domestic cases. The first is the tragically straightforward murder of a cantankerous old man by his wife. The other is a more cruelly deceptive one, in which a man is killed, and his son and one of his daughters go missing: Frost tracks them down to Blackpool, where she has gone for an abortion - but who was the father? The answer leads him and DS Barnard into a tragic confrontation with an armed and dangerous paedophile.
