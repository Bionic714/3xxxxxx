,Demonio316,2008-02-16T17:45Z,"Another top-notch upload!  Thanks Echizen.

Can't believe its 4 years old, wow.  A testament to its quality.

blood6shot, check your torrent client settings.  Are you using a router?  I had the same problem until I forwarded to an open port.

Lastly, I find that Windows Media Player Classic is easiest for dealing with subtitles."
,instinct_X,2008-05-25T12:05Z,"For Swanee and others having problem with subtitles:

I have uploaded a highly cleaned up version of the subs in .srt format to Open subtitles. Here's the link

http://www.opensubtitles.com/en/subtitles/3288319/yeopgijeogin-geunyeo-ko

To Echizen: Thanks for an awesome upload, man! This movie rocks! :)"
,jotswa,2008-07-03T09:45Z,"i downloaded the movie, i downloaded the subtitle from http://www.opensubtitles.com/en/subtitles/3288319/yeopgijeogin-geunyeo-en 

i did everything it said about renaming the subtitle file like the movie file so it looks like this: 

My Sassy Girl [ECHiZEN].avi  and  My Sassy Girl [ECHiZEN].srt

but still the subtitle wont come out! i used media player classic to open the file.

PLS! NEED HELP BADLY! I WANTED TO LET MY GIRL SEE THIS MOVIE FOR THE LONGEST TIME! NEED HELP!"

,instinct_X,2008-07-07T08:46Z,"jotswa, do you have DirectVobSub installed? If you do not, then you need it to make .srt subtitles work. Get it from here:

,sofiasefora,2008-09-04T21:13Z,"To all who has the subs problem, do what instinct_x had suggested. After downloading it, open the zip folder but don't open the file which has the subs, instead, extract that file to the folder of this torrent. That's it, enjoy the movie ;-)"
