<b><a href="http://www.londonaftermidnight.com/">London after midnight - Oddities</a></b>

"Oddities" is a very welcome surprise particularly for fans of this band. If you know either "Selected Scenes from the End of the World" and "Psycho-Magnet" (if you don't, get them!) this interesting compilation of unusually stylish live recordings, acoustic versions of previous album tracks, and other alluring curiosities is an essential companion to London After Midnight's previous releases. "The Christmas Song" is a seductive rival to the best of the usual Noel anthems (this is surely to Sean Brennan's credit) and a personal favorite. Other highlights are "Let Me Break You", "Demon", "Untitled" and (unless you are astute enough to keep constant watch over your CD player's track indicator) an unexpectedly festive surprise at the end! This release, "Oddities", is certainly much, much more than a collection of obscurities: it is a classy release in its own right.
