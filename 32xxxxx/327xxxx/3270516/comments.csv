,forget_forever,2006-03-31T04:53Z,"If you steal a band's music and they can no longer earn a living to produce the music. LAM's CDs are available all over the world - on iTunes, on every online store, in music stores, etc. Go to londonaftermidnight.com for easy directions on how to obtain LAM CDs. Please support the band by buying the CD rather than stealing the CD."
