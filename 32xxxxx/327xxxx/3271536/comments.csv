,BandC,2005-01-02T07:09Z,"First Encounter, Second Encounter will become a release from me soon WITH a crack cause i dont have a original CD on that one :/. So i cant make a good copy of it"
,maiSter,2005-01-03T16:00Z,This game owns.. IM downloadin Second encounter right now but im gonna download this later.. !
,BandC,2005-01-03T16:30Z,"Don´t forget!

Serious Sam 2 will come out soon.

Serious Sam First and Second Encounter is Serious Sam 1. It´s like a book but with just two chapters in it.

So first and second encounter is the first and second chapter inte the first book. :).

I´ve read it on their homepage :)"
,NFSU2,2005-01-06T09:55Z,"this both first and Second Encounter is better than Doom3 u all will love them both ,but play first encounter first"
,BandC,2005-01-07T00:19Z,"To NFSU2 yepp that´s absolutley right! Doom 3 sucks in compare with these two games :).

Doom 3 is badly coded so thats why it isnt fun to play.

The less code you use the better game you make :D."
