Next time i rebooted my computer a message appeared that said something like this: You're illegal, you've broken rules, in some cases ""Copyright infingement may be punishable if found guilty in a civil judgement up to $250,000 USD per incident.""

That sucks I thought so i removed the program from the computer but this message keeps appearing and if I read the last sentences it says: ""We do not provide any technical suppor for users which choose to pirate our software. You will need to consult the software license agreement (found in the installation directory-license.txt.)"" - ""We advice you to become a legal user of the software by purchasing a valid license immeiately as you are in violation of the software license agreement; and aslo no longer use illegally licensed software.

Now I need to download this shit since I removed it.

This sucks don't even think of downloading it."
