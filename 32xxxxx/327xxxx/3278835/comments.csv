,Nomi1985,2005-05-29T19:00Z,Archive #15 (.r15) from episode 20 is corrupted.
,Nomi1985,2005-05-29T19:48Z,"If you are struggling with this release, you can get the missing files from here: http://www.the-realworld.de/modules.php?name=ed2k&op=release&rid=206

This link provides this same release except it's not rarred.  Ofcourse you will need a client such as eMule or eDonkey that can take ED2K links.  I suggest eMule."
