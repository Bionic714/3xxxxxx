,longmike,2005-07-23T20:12Z,"I'm new to burning dvdr's and am having trouble getting the audio for this DVD to work when I use Nero to create a DVD-video.  I get the following message when I try to play the file:  

""Due to license restrictions, the DVD video will be played without audio decoding from Nero ShowTime.  However you will be able to hear the audio if your digital audio output is connected to an external decoder capable of decoding DTS""

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!"
