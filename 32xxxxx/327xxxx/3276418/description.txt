³ ³ This is the story of three gentle persons: Paul Rivers (Penn)  ³ ³

   ³ ³ an ailing mathematician lovelessly married to an English       ³ ³

   ³ ³ emigré (Gainsbourg), Christina Peck, an upper-middle-class     ³ ³

   ³ ³ suburban housewife, happily married and mother of two little   ³ ³

   ³ ³ girls, and Jack Jordan (Del Toro), an ex-convict who has found ³ ³

   ³ ³ in his Christian faith the strenght to raise a family. They    ³ ³

   ³ ³ will be brought together by a terrible accident that will      ³ ³

   ³ ³ change their lives. By the final frame, none of them will be   ³ ³

   ³ ³ the same as they will learn harsh truths about love, faith,    ³ ³

   ³ ³ courage, desire and guilt, and how chance can change our       ³ ³

   ³ ³ worlds irretrievably, forever.
