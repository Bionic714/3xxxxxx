Please seed better movies! New and well known movies as LOTR and 
King Arthur are avaible everywhere, and are of little interest.

My computer might accidently go offline, maybe when Im at work. 
If you have the time to sit online and bitch about seeds all day,
this movie is not for you.


FUCK HIPHOP!

Skål / Cheers
