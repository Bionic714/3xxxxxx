,tomas,2005-01-18T00:52Z,well maybe there isn't an error with the copy but me who didn't relize it was the same on the cd. :) so I'll seed this.

Getting a bit tired of people putting up torrents without a specified bitrate, and the disappointment of finding stuff in 128.

Great to see a lossless version of this awesome album, to counter that disppointment!"
