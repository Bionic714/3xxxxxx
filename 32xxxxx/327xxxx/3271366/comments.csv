,e97jn,2006-12-01T00:20Z,"Well, no one will probably ever seed all files belonging to this torrent again. My theory is that ""the last seeder"" erased all files but the movie file itself (.avi). Since one of the three small files was before the avi-file and two after, the first and last seconds/bytes of the avi-file can't be downloaded since these fragments/parts of the file are missing. Because of these parts missing my Media Player refuses to start playing the movie.

My solution:
There is another torrent for the same movie (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3237953/The.Neverending.Story.1984.DVDRip.DivX-CLiX) where the first small file isn't included. This means that the start of the movie is complete and my Media Player could play it (but probably not the last 3 seconds or so).

To avoid downloading the entire movie again I stopped the torrent/download, deleted the torrent and all files EXCEPT the avi-file. Then I downloaded the other torrent and selected the download location where the ""almost-complete-movie"" was. By this I got my missing bytes in the beginning of the movie in a second, and now it works!

Good luck."
