LAME @ 192 CBR

First and only album by Shadow King, featuring Lou Gramm (vocals), Viv Campbell (guitar), Bruce Turgon (bass) and Kevin Valentine (drums).

With 'Shadow King' being released in the same year as the seminal albums from Nirvana and Pearl Jam, it's easy to see how this 'Big Hair' supergroup was doomed from the start. The choice of single (and video) can't have helped either. A bluesy rocker in the Alannah Myles style that was popular at the time, 'I Want You' was uncharacteristic compared to the excellent, guitar-driven melodic rock of the rest of the album. With not a single weak track (with the possible exception of the single) and Lou Gramm's powerful vocal performance, it's no wonder that this album has become rightly regarded as a cult AOR classic.
