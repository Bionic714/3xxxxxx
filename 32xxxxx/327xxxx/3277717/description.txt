A hit and run driver kills an elderly man, after deliberately drawing attention by wild driving on a residential estate. On the same evening the local private casino, the Sherwood Club, is violently robbed of its night's takings. It is immediately apparent that the car belongs to the local MP's son, Roger Massie, whom Frost has charged with motoring offences on more than one occasion, but whose excellent legal team have got him cleared. Frost gets a humorless new partner, DC Webster, to assist him in the investigations. Then a dangerous armed robber, Ronnie Eustace, seeks refuge in the Denton area, and a police officer is shot dead while on patrol. An armed hunt for the fugitive tracks him down, and he takes a pair of hostages, but Frost is persuaded to substitute himself for them.
