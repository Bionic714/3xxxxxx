,cosjav,2005-01-22T10:34Z,"is this xp pro or corporate? and is it the english version??? (whats the diff between pro and corp anyway?)

how can u make this site ENGLISH???"
,cosjav,2005-01-22T10:55Z,"by the way, why is this so much bigger than other winxp sp2 packages i have seen? its like 100 or so megabytes bigger..."
,Backwards,2005-01-29T09:07Z,"Pro and Corp are almost the same except for a couple key facts.

- With corp you can swap out your hardware as much as you want and it wont ever ask you for a re-install

- You dont have to activate it like you have to with PRO. Just use the supplied keygen to generate a key, install and then you are done. You can even recieve updates

The reason this is 100megs larger is because there is a file called ""xtras"" in the iso."

,flymann,2005-03-14T14:49Z,"What does the file ""xtras"" contain? Is it an optional installation or does it install together with XP?"

,Wandel_,2005-03-30T20:17Z,"När man bränner ut skivan så heter den XPPOEM,
does that sound like corp to you?"
,BrightS,2005-04-25T00:24Z,"English version, bootable and accepts a corporate key.
Works like a charm! :)"

,bonewood,2005-07-04T23:49Z,"just downloaded this but its not an iso when you open the rar its the files needed to install windows but not to make the cd bootable, so you can upgrade with it but will not boot at all any help would be appreciated"
,DSTER,2005-08-11T05:42Z,"Thanks GypsyJo44!............Bonewood it doesn't need to be bootable to ""boot"" from...does that make sense?.... anyways pop in a old win98 bootdisk and boot off that, then when in command prompt type ""e:i386winnt"" (or if your cd-rom is a different letter type that letter for instance ""d:i386winnt"" .... with out the quotes of course) And Presto!
