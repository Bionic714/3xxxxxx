,Ykalon,2005-01-01T16:31Z,Detta program är inte så revolutionärt som man trott. Är bara en ny variant av Kazaa. Funkar bara med Windows.
,Bookbinder,2005-01-01T17:27Z,"SerieNr, funkar ej.

Det rycker i nedladdnings nerven
den här väntan är olidlig"
,doofus,2005-01-01T17:32Z,"Kazaa med Bitorrent protokoll. Lover bra ettersom alle kan fungere som egen tracker.. 

Blir en liten revolusjon når det kommer ut ettersom flaskehalser blir borte samt ting blir raskere lagt ut.

RIAA og MPAA's største skrekk dette her..

Doof"
,No.21,2005-01-02T08:12Z,Låter som RevConnect :/
,fletchdaf,2005-01-02T08:16Z,"Seriel number doesn't work.  Says it is ""already linked to an IP"".  

I'm testing the program which may work anyway.

It does load a torrent file (though it won't show the torrent file name in the open dialogue box).

I'm waiting for the torrent to connect.  Exeem is saying that it has failed to connect due to a timeout by the tracker.  Well that happens all the time with whatever program you are using.

Will keep you posted."
,fletchdaf,2005-01-02T08:28Z,"ok.  it has dl'd about 32 kiB.

Now, it saw one peer which quickly disappeared.

I don't know what to make of it.  It could be connecting to the tracker and just not be able to stay connected, in which case it is a piss poor bt client.

Or it could have been connecting to a central server which discovered I was not an authorized beta user and turfed me.  This means, of course, that the beta is not operating like the hype said it would, without a central tracker, based on each client being its own type of tracker.

Or, it could have been connecting to an actual beta user who had published the torrent I was attempting to get, and who discovered I was an unauthorized user and simply disconnected from me.

Don't know.  My recommendation is to wait until the program actually comes out.  It will be free and if the team developing it (the ex-suprnova team) is as good as they were with suprnova, it will be well worth the wait.

Ser ut som man lyckats redan med att strippa
BETA-releasen.

Er det rigtigt Slonck ikke står bag men bare har fået en pose penge for at promovere programmet. Er der virklig adware (cydoor) Trist!! Vi må vente lidt endnu, men hvis det hele er rigtigt kan man jo altid glæde sig til lite versionen som med sikkerhed vil dukke op :-)"
