A romantic love story may begin when two lovers are living together. But what story will begin when an unfamiliar innocent woman demands living in a stingy guy's house?

Working as a self-proclaimed novelist, Sun-kook (Kim Seung-woo) neither uses a heater in winter nor has any cell phone. The only belonging he owns is his house. Nevertheless, Hwa-jung (Kim Jung-eun), who traveled from Pusan to Seoul, suddenly appeared outside Sun-kook's house and claimed to own the house! How is he going to share his precious property with her?

The hilarious K love comedy "Spring breeze" starring Kim Seung-woo from "Reversal of Fortune" and Kim Jung-eun from "Marrying the Mafia" presents to you an alternative love relationship!
