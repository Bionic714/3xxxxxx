Burn using programs like ""Dvd Decrypter"", ""Alcohol 120%"" or ""Nero Burning Rom""

I used Dvd Decrypter, freeware!

[T],SpandauBaby,2008-05-26T17:12Z,"This is a message from SpandauBaby (ME) to all of you that read this torrent, I took the time myself to download this thinking that it will finish sometime soon.  I've obviously wasted my time bothering, should have realised, look people forget this one it's obviously not gonna seed properly, it's an abandoned seed and it won't finish, probably never again!  Here's another one instead you might as well get this it won't take long to download:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3274278/Singstar_READNFO_PAL_DVD_PS2-LIGHTFORCE

Also, this torrent if you've already burned it then you've wasted your discs, it won't be right and the image you have on your DVDs is missing some vital information, never listen to anybody who goes around saying that you can burn a torrent when it's incomplete, that is wrong and it will probably get stuck when trying to read that segment on the disc.  So anyway forget this, it's obviously a waste of time.  Have fun people! :-D"
,nathanael_a,2008-07-16T11:38Z,"Snälla, vi är flera som sitter fast på 99,5/99,4% skulle någon kunna seeda? Pleeeeez"

,pcty,2008-10-21T21:09Z,Rick Astley! Let´s Rick Roll!!!
,HIyaalll,2010-02-04T10:33Z,"SpandauBaby stop talking when you don't know what youre talking about.. there are several file-types that can be used even if it is not 100%.. as long as you get MOST it just MIGHT be useful.. f.ex. I have watched several movies (avi and likes) that were on a 99.x basis.. the vid just gets distorted for a second at the place of the gap.. when it comes to raw copies of media files, like this one, it is also possible that any gap just MIGHT be at a part of a sector that actually IS unused, which would mean NO loss of data (though you must be LUCKY for that to be true).. in this case.. In this specific case we are talking about a four gig image of which a very small portion is system-critical information (the first couple of sectors, the file-system, the actual program data, plus the few files that contain the lyrics/beat info).. the rest (movie and music) is not vital for functionality.. probability says that it most likely works perfectly, with exception for one or two films which either works but not looks good, or you just have to not play those songs.. but no damage can be made from attempting to burn and play this disc."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-02-22T17:33Z,"@HIyaalll: You talk utter gobshite!  I am right and you are wrong, clearly fuck off you dumbass prick!"
[T],ThingsfromHeaven101,2010-07-07T21:25Z,Ho ho ho. Both SpandauBaby and HIyaalll are correct in this case. Movies that are not 100% complete can be watched yes because a movie streams each section separately and does not check all the files before playing. Thats why you can watch most of it with only small gaps. However people must realize that Video Games require ALL FILES to be fully downloaded before using ESPECIALLY PS2 BECAUSE IT CHECKS ALL FILES BEFORE STARTING THE GAME.
