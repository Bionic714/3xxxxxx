Hey,

Here's the text from the torrent itself. This will take a while to seed, but if you're a Live Aid fan, its worth it.

You'll find in these set of four disks (on seven hours) "nearly" all the
missing bits that were not included in the official Live Aid box set.

You'll find below the complete list of what's in and what's not.

As for the disks :

They are PAL but should be readable on any computer in the world. People
living in an NTSC country should check their equipment (DVD player / TV set)
for compatibility with PAL signals.

The disks are region free. They were copied onto DVD using a Pionneer DVR
720H with a compression factor giving two hours of recording per disk.

We have not made menus nor chapters on these disks (but you can skip by ten minutes steps). 

This compilation was made from a large variety of sources, from the BBC
(pal) feed the German (pal) feed, MTV (ntsc) and ABC (ntsc) on either VHS or Betamax tapes.

The quality varies from very good to "watchable" but this is all what we had
at the time of creation. The sound is mono and sometime even only left chanel. It's quality varies from good to "low and hissy".

Of course, this product isn't official. It was only made in order to fill
the gaps in the official Live Aid box. The digital transfert has been made in order to store this historical performance. The makers of these DVDs would like to point out that there has been non intent to profit in any way from this recording. On this purpose many messages were included to urge
people not to sell this product and make donations to the Live Aid / Band Aid trusts by the usual means.

Furthermore, the makers of this compilation urge everyone not to sell or
redistribute these DVDs for a monetary profit.

Remember Live Aid was not about music. It was about people dying.
