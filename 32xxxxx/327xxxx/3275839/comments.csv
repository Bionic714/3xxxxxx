,Hmmkk,2005-02-15T22:31Z,"Har laddat den och hållt på nästan 1 vecka, gjorde just session 5... Programmets kommentar/text sa i stil med att hastigheten borde gått upp med nästan runt 200-300 vid det laget, det kan jag säga att det har den verkligen inte;P Men finns många bra test och sådant man kan göra i programmet så det är helt klart värt att testas, lite hjälper det ju minst i alla fall. Min ""chart"" går upp och ned men tenderar att gå uppåt iaf och har väl kommit upp till runt 350 WPM (words per minute) som max. Sen har jag gjort några comprehension (förståelse) test, där jag idag hade 240 wpm och 240 effektiva wpm (alla rätt på 10 frågorna).
Någon annan som har lust att posta sina resultat hittills?"

,shadowmonkey,2006-08-22T08:35Z,"Try setting, ""using the setup file"", up the file and then read the file from a cd, it should work perfectly."
,sauronsmatrix,2008-01-15T23:33Z,great software. i love you teo-x thanks for this
,sauronsmatrix,2008-01-16T00:09Z,"serial is EYEQ33PER7W
[on the root folder of the iso, serial.txt]

to make this work, mount with a cd emulator or burn it to a CD, as there is no crack"
,sauronsmatrix,2008-01-16T00:39Z,"soooooo I started out reading 221 words per minute.

After ONE test, I am now reading at 500 words per minute. Everyone in the world should have this software."
,kratos24,2008-05-20T00:50Z,thanx works very fine. you just need an iso maker to make iso image or you can just burn it on cd. For iso maker you can download magiciso from piratebay. EyeQ is a must have software.
,msbubbly,2008-08-01T10:11Z,plz seed.............

,nevernow,2010-09-20T09:02Z,"These comments are years old, but did anyone else have the same issue as ""sn777""  did back then """"There has been a problem reaing from the CDROM drive. Please call the customer support number...""

I've never had an issue mounting to either PowerISO or MagicISO, and I tried both, but neither works.  Any help would be appreicated.

Thanks"
,nevernow,2010-09-20T09:06Z,"Meant to say  that I am getting the same error that says """"There has been a problem reading from the CDROM drive. Please call...""

Thanks again for any help"
