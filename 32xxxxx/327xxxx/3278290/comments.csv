Is it possible to have all covers for all beethoven collection?

bye"
,Como,2005-02-09T21:47Z,"Thanks! Great work and music! But - I can't find movement no 6 (Finale, Allegro) from string quartet Bb op 130.  Maybe you have missed it - or?  I'm interested to get it!  Regards!"
,ltoth,2005-03-15T02:15Z,"I made an error in this torrent and omitted the finale to Op130 (it ends with the Cavatina! Sorry. Thanks to grofinet for noticing the omission!). The finale is available as a separate torrent ""Beethoven-Op130-Finale-Emerson Quartet-EAC-LAME VBR (Reseed)"" and you should look for this to complete the set.

Thank you."
,coe74,2008-01-28T10:06Z,"Hi, thanks so much for making this torrent available. Have you noticed that No. 13 Op.130 is labelled in comments as being LINDSAY SQ instead of Emerson - I think it's true - I've compared versions and it sounds a lot like the aggressive playing of the Lindsays. "
,guymsea,2009-03-06T09:44Z,Good recording but not not all from the Emerson String Quartet. For some reason most of the Quartet in Bb including the Fugue is by the Lindsay String Quartet.
