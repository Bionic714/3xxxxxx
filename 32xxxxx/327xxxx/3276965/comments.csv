,mogto,2005-01-26T08:28Z,"I'll quote from:

The Wind Technique
http://www.humanbeatbox.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid=17648

""The Wind Technique is one of four routines that appear on Rahzel's influential album Make The Music 2000. After track 16 - a rendition of Rahzels often immitated 'If Your Mother Only Knew' routine - there is a secret track that features a man vs machine battle. The beatboxers respond with 'four elements', the second of which is the Wind Technique.""

This torrent is apparently track 16 and the bonus track.  The minute and a half of silence is even included, wasting space.  Could at least have used variable bit rate."
