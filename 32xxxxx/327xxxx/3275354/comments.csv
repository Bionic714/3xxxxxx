Your awesome!!

,bopy,2005-01-29T14:27Z,"This is not an avi file but a mov.
1. forget playing it on standalone DVD-Divx player
2. Audio is AAC 2 channel = STEREO!!!!

Why, why, why would someone be so stupid to make almost 3GB movie with mediocre audio?
Thanx for missleading and for wasted bandwidth."
