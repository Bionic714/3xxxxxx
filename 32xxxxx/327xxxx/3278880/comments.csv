,Ozmer,2005-06-06T07:59Z,"Burnt all three CD's just as in the NFO, and perfectly installed the game. However when I hit ""play"" the mini splash logo comes up in the middle of my screen, sits there, then vampire.exe crashes and tries to send an error report. Any ideas on how to fix it?"
,Ozmer,2005-06-06T19:49Z,"Found my fix. If you're having the same problem I told about below with the game not starting right then download softdisc/daemon tools, or a similar virtual drive program and mount the iso.iso image and start the game. Should run just fine."
,Cixx,2005-07-16T02:51Z,11 seeders an 0kbs. think you people should increase your upload rate afterall you could not download it without people letting you. 
,blaze7,2005-07-18T12:34Z,"go to ""megagames"" look for PC game fixes and download the NO CD fixes,  there are two and one of them works.  There is also a mini-image but I recommend the No CD patches as one of them works also use at least the 1.2 patch or you will get stuck at the end of the Missionary quest when you try and jump on the boat.  If you have any trouble PM me and I will upload the patch and No CD and then PM you.  Sorry I just noticed this message."
