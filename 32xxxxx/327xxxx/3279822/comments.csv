please - needed info of the file.
is it MP42 codec (mpeg4 v2)? cause this makes it unplayable for dvd players.
tks

,orione,2005-01-23T12:14Z,"I'm afraid it's not a new rip.
Gspot says it's DivX 3 at 994 bitrate.
On the PC quality is quite good, I don't know if it can be played in a dvd reader. 
Enjoy it though, this movie is memorable indeed."
,orione,2005-01-25T12:30Z,"Strange, I got no rating on this one: was it that bad? "
