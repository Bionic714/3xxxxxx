YOU most Try to download this torrent if you want the real tracks from vinyl LP.:

Elf - Elf (Good UK Hardrock w. Ronnie James Dio 1972) (@256)

This torrent is: Size: 66.2 MB, Bitrade: 256, mp3.
Ripped By: ChrisGoes(Rock)
I like ""ChrisGoes"" coments in info.txt about Ronald Padavona (better known as Ronnie James Dio). This isn't hard rock, it's bluesy rock.
It's a studiorecord. Dio does vocals AND bass. It's also the only Elf album that features Dio's cousin David Feinstein on guitar.
Happy New Year from me to all of you ""pirates""."
