,atheer_diz,2005-01-19T15:42Z,"hej toba toppen filmer som vanligt. Men jag undrar om du kan skaffa miike takashi's nya film IZO Skulle vara assschysst, väntat ett tag men har inte kommit ut nånstans,
Annars undrar jag om du har gamla klassiker som Iron monkey som du kan seeda.

Keep up the good work och tack på förhand!"

,kder,2005-01-28T19:15Z,"I´ve downloaded the 3 movies, but the first 2 (shinjuku + rainy dog) are incomplete, the movies finish before the ending. in fact, Rainy Dog only lasts 50 minutes.
Do anyone know if it´s right or the movies downloaded wrong?

thanks!"
,kder,2005-01-28T20:18Z,"vlc seems to play the movies right, even the total time counter still shows ""51 min"", but i´can´t wait for a new computer.
yet another windows mistery
thanks again, toba"
