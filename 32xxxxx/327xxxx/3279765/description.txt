A japanese zombieflick with japanese schoolgirls! Can it be any better? :D This is one of my favorite movies. 


Completely ripped off from IMDB:

Stacy is is kind of movie that you'll either loathe or love. The whole
subject matter is trashy and sleazy. Young school girls, dressed in
sailor suits turning rabid when they mature. It's so wrong but it's fun
at the same time. Everything about this movie is a riot. The Romero
Squads, the Drew Barrymore gang and the Bruce Campbell chainsaws are
some examples. The only thing that i didn't like was that the movie was
shot on Digital Video,that's my only real gripe. This movie has
everything that I like in a horror film. It was cheesy, bloody, sleazy
and disturbing. I highly recommend it. If you love zombie movies and
movies that don't take everything so seriously.
I would rather watch ten movies like this than have to sit through
another Resident Evil picture. For true horror fans only!!

If this torrent appears to be dead because of my connection went out, time, torrent raids, lack of interest, nuclear war, zombie holocaust, whatever, don't ever hesitate to send me a messege. I'll bring it up again, I promise. ;)
