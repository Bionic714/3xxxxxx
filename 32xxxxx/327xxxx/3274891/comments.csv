Am I assuming that the ""syncfix"" changes the audio from 6ch (which is what the original NFO says)?"
,scottchicken,2005-01-11T06:23Z,"My mistake!  Just played this with XBMC and my AV Receiver picked it up as multi-channel audio!

Cheers!

Maht Dahmin!!"
,T-Boy29,2005-01-11T12:51Z,i've already fixed the audio with that sync fix so no need for that ;-)
,Bluesxreen,2005-01-11T20:01Z,"no-one with a dvd-r img ?
I need it.. Badly..."
,scottchicken,2005-01-12T11:37Z,"Ignore my previous comments regard multi-channel audio.

The original NFO states ""mp3 6ch"" but I believe if it is mp3, then it is 2ch.   It needs to be AC3 to be multi (5.1/6) channel.

I had XBMC settup incorrectly which was why my AV receiver thought it was multi-channel.

So the question is, does there exist a AC3 multi-channel audio release of Team America?"
,T-Boy29,2005-01-12T13:28Z,no idea

[T],Robin86,2005-01-16T17:10Z,"Zaiko,
Du kan spela den i Windows Media Player, men du måste ha XviD-codecen installerad. Har du inte den kan du installera Mega Codec Pack, som du hittar här: http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm

Den innehåller alla codecs du behöver och även Media Player Classic som är mycket bättre än Windows Media Player."
,Deconstruc,2005-01-17T17:13Z,"can anybody please upload a ""cut"" of the film os I can check the Q :)?"
