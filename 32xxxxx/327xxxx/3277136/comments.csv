,xkexkexke,2008-02-04T13:20Z,"In this movie Jackie Chan impersonates the inspector Wing, who is the Hong Kong police's resident best cop. He's the best of all, cracking every case he handles in record time. There is no one like him. The actor Nicholas Tse impersonates Fung, who is a rebel, a typically disaffected but street-smart Hong Kong youth who wastes his life in video game arcades all the time.Fung can talk very cheap, and no one talks cheaper than him. Fung wants to be a police officer but due to his family's
criminal background, he will never become it, and he follows in the footsteps of Wing, who is his all-time idol. Finally,Fung gets the chance to realize his goal of becoming a detective. He tricks Wing into joining forces with him on the trail of a truly vicious band of enemies whose name is: The Gang of Five! For more information go to wing-chunws/New%20Police%20Story.html"
