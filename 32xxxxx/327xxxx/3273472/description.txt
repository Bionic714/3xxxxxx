'The 1980s were most definitely the heyday for  all things AOR. Stadium rockers Foriegner gone soft, a retooled Heart and the ever popular  Journey ruled the early 80s and waiting in their wings were plenty more bands: Night  Ranger, Mr. Mister, the delactable Icon and oh-so many others. Radio was flooded with song  after song of U.S. AOR hopefuls trying to hit it big with mainstream friendly tunes while  the creams of the crop were across the Atlantic on the other side, such as the killer  Scandi outfits, the quite successful Europe and... FM.'
