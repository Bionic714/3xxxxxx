Recorded in the US, Deva Premal's new album contains six sacred chants from India and a beautiful chant from West Africa. The sound is rich, expansive, and alive, the musicianship first-class and Premal's singing is just great (says Miten!)
   Featuring Om Shree Sache, Jai Radha Madhav, and other favorites from the duo's concerts, the album continues in the footsteps of THE ESSENCE.
