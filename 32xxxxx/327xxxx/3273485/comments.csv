,Jonas g ,2007-03-11T22:58Z,"Why does FSX need so good pc specs, I don't find the graphic so good, I mean look at for example Oblivion. The graphics is much better in that game. I can run Oblivion at full graphic, but, I have problems with low framrate in FSX. I just don't see why it takes 2x 8800gtx to run that game with a normal framerate."
