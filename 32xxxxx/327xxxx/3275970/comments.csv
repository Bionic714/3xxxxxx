,DomanR,2005-01-14T16:14Z,"This is not XBMC FAQ or Help. You have other sites for this. Take it or leave it!
BTW thx Drizzel!"
,Shiver_st,2005-01-15T03:47Z,"Thank you Drizzle, I realy enjoy your uploads. Hope you continue to upload despite the ungratefull fuc*s that complain over things they get 4 free!! :D"
,Frezzno,2005-01-15T10:55Z,"Well Drizzel, don't loose your temper so easy because of us noobs and ungreatful idiots. 

Let noobs help noobs for a change.

Here it goes:

I made the radio script to work by copy the folder 'simpleKML' and the file KMLbrowse.py from the scripts folder of previous releases.

The playlist thing is saved in albums/playlists folder in XBMC main folder. Just Browse there and execute the file.

For those who doesn't know how to create a playlist:

1. Select the files you want to the playlist by pressing the Y button. You can select files from different folder and even from network.
2. Press the BLACK button to switch to playlist view. Here you can save the list.

The list can be use right away, but after you reset the box just remeber that the list is saved in albums/playlists folder."
