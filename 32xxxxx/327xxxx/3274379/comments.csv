,elyk1212,2006-09-11T00:14Z,"""I assume you mean ""MBps""? :) M is mega, m is milli. A millibyte, as you abbreviated, is a billionth of a megabyte. ;)""
Yes, but a Milli byte would have not meaning.  A bit is indivisible, 8 bits in a byte, thus it would be 8/1000 = .008 bits.  This would have no meaning..., Or would that be super compressed I/O, signals, or data? ;)  Anyhow, the meaning is not ambiguous if one knows this limitation.  E.g. you cannot have half a bit signal in hardware, nor in software.  All floating points are still represented in whole bits somewhere {registers,memory, bus etc}.  This goes for all digital electronics.

Anyhow, he wrote mbits, not mbytes.  I would assume me means mega-bits, but I don't know the language.  So if we are going to dissect the nomenclature, it is good to at least clarify these things."
