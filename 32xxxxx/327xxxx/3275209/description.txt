With the original line up intact, the band takes to a stage          
decorated in exactly the same style as their 1980s tour, and         
work their way through the album. The punishing intensity of        
their playing hasn't let up over the years, and the group           
members clearly delight in playing some classic material. With      
the REIGN IN BLOOD album performed in its entirety, tracks such      
as Angel of Death,Criminally Insane, and Jesus Saves come     
to life once again. As an added bonus, Slayer also performs a        
selection of other classics, including South of Heaven, War       
Ensemble, and Mandatory Suicide.
As the group exits with blood-like rain falling on them, there can
be no doubt that they have entered the pantheon of classic metal bands.
