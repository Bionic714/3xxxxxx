    SingStar features three gameplay modes that allow for between one and
    eight players to join in together. Sing Mode encourages you to simply
    pick up the mic and start singing, either alone or battling against
    a mate. Pass the Mic is the ultimate party game, encouraging duets 
    and team competitions; and Star Maker allows budding stars to follow 
    your dream from singing in the bedroom to performing in a sell-out 
    concert for your adoring fans. 

    SingStar comes with two microphones that plug into PlayStation 2 via
    a USB adapter, offering an instant multi-play experience. In addition,
    the game is EyeToy compatible, allowing you to actually see yourself
    singing within the game.

   <--( Important Note )------------------------------------------ ----- -->
 
    This game needs the orginal microphones which comes with the orginal 
    game-package ... when you start singstar you can go through the 
    hole menue, hear all songs, but cannot start singing yet. Perhaps it
    will be playable when a 3rd party company sells the hardware alone.
    
    We had tested it only with EyeToy-Cam and/or Socom USB-HeadSet, 
    but we had no luck - you really need the microphones with the USB
    Converter.
    
    So decide yourself if you spread or download it ... you have been 
    informed!
    
    But if you liked the EyeToy games you should also BUY this one ... it
    is a really funny party game! Support such innovating software!
