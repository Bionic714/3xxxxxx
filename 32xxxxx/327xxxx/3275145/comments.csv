,giovanotti,2007-04-03T23:59Z,"tomasthc.

i almost finished the movie. i am at 99,1% as most of the people here.
i don't know who ever finished it. but could please seed it again.

i heard it's a really good movie. and i would be quite sad to not be able to see it, because of 1 min. that i missed...

thanks a lot in advance... "
,ninaninanina,2007-06-27T18:21Z,i have the same problem. What should i do? Thank you!
,ninaninanina,2007-07-09T19:49Z,does anyone have the complete movie??? 
,punkluc,2008-01-19T18:26Z,"didn't read comments properly, film has only 'Norsk' subtitles and also got stuck on 99.1%."
,simonhead,2008-03-06T05:02Z,Can somebody seed? thanks
,ghostgirl969,2008-06-12T02:25Z,"If you're at 99% try using VLC, chances are it will read it. Might skip at a point or two but you'll be able to watch it. Keep seeding, I'm dl now :)"
,ditto77,2008-08-07T20:38Z,why don't you seed? all is stuck at 99.1 and the movie is great. would you please seed to finish?
