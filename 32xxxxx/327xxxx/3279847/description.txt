This is a little thing I did on my spare time, I mapped some Metallica songs and made own versions of them with key synths mostly and some other synths.

Nothing really serious, just like to fiddle with music thats all. Might be fun to hear if you like Metallica or just like to hear my interpretations of the songs.
The style of the songs is in Ambient Electronica.

The songs I included are:

01 - Noting Else Matters
02 - Fade To Black
03 - Enter Sandman
04 - Master Of Puppets
05 - For Whom The Bell Tolls
06 - One
07 - Battery
08 - Sad But True
09 - Welcome Home (Sanatarium)
10 - The Unnamned Feeling

The are encoded in OGG but most players today handle OGG so that should be no problem.
