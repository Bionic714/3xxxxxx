Ciao!

I have gotten many request from people who missed the first compilation of my favorite Italo Disco Clips. 
I can understand the demand cause I think  it contains some of the best Italo Disco ever made. (atleast imho)

So here's finally a reseed of Vol 1.

If I get a positive response then maybe I will do a brand new volume later on this week. It's up to you ;-)
Please help out with the seed as you finish it.

Enjoy and help keep the Italo spirit alive!
