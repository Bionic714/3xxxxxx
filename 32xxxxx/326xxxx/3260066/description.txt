Album Notes
The St. Germain neighborhood in Paris is the city's epicenter of students, writers, artists and jazz musicians. Naturally, the music heard in all the clubs and eateries is ahead of its time and more progressive...and always of superior quality. A seamless collection of tasty jazz treats. The disc is great to listen to intently or even as background at a special event.
