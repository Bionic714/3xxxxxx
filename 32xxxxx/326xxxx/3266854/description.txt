It's now five years since Fraps was first released to the public. To
      help celebrate this milestone we've released the next major update,
      Fraps 2.5.0
      
      There's something for everyone with 60 fps recording, HDTV 1280x720
      supprt, and extra lossless compression that reduces the burden on
      hard drives without sacrificing quality. If screenshots are more your
      thing it's also now possible to automatically capture screens at
      fixed rate intervals.
      
      We've also taken advantage of the latest benefits in CPU and bus
      technology. Think nothing can take advantage of PCI-Express? Think
      again! Fraps 2.5 can process hundreds of megabytes of video data and
      make full use of the extra bandwidth.
      
      At this point we'd like to extend a very special thanks to all who
      have supported the program over the years. Your help, suggestions,
      and registrations have all been instrumental in getting Fraps to the
      stage it is now and we hope you enjoy the latest release.
