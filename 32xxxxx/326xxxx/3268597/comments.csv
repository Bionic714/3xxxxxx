,bobsmith,2004-12-24T17:03Z,"I don't speak Swedish, so I used an online translation program and it came up with:

Delicate mte become get rid cushion etter juleribba. Takker!

I assume cushion is Swedish for beer-belly!"
,franqieboy,2004-12-24T22:29Z,"Hehe, i´ll give you a hint... Never use an Swedish translator when someone writes in Norwegian. 

Im not fluent speaking norwegian, but i´l try give you better translation, even though i dubt you have any good use for it. But its X-mas so here it comes:

""Fin måte å bli kvitt valkene etter juleribba. Takker ""

""Nice need to get rid of the fat/""tires"" after the x-mas ribs. Thanks"""
,bobsmith,2004-12-25T02:07Z,"Well I used a web based translator, and thought this is a Swedish site...

Tried again with Nowegian, and got:

Fine mte become get rid valkene after juleribba. thanking

Computer translations crack me up sometimes...  The Swedish translation was funnier though (although not as useless)."

,Mustard18,2010-06-16T23:31Z,Wow Great video! But I highly suggest going through the video and trying to learn some of the moves first before you start so you don't get lost when are trying to work out
