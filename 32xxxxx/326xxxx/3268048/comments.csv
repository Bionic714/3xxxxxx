,Trogdor,2005-03-03T12:44Z,Iso is 5.67 GB.. wont burn!!
,Zetoss,2005-03-07T03:10Z,"I sure as heck am glad this is NOT a million .rar files, I HATE .rar files! takes freakin' forever to unpack, and not to mention the discspace needed!!! How can this iso be too big for you to burn Trogdor? the info here on piratebay says clearly it's 4,36GB... you've messed something up dude...

anyway, thanx to tjocke8an för han verkar schysst ;-)"
,RedXIII,2005-07-10T05:49Z,"Which one is the Win XP Pro Corporate? When I go to create separate ISO's I see retail, oem and VLM. I don't see one that say's corporate and what the hell does VLM mean?"
,Alom2,2006-01-30T11:09Z,Please seed...
,TheAngryIntern,2006-04-25T03:26Z,"got everything downloaded fine and made a stand alone MCE .iso.  everything seems ok, except it says Xp Professional setup and is asking for a Product Key, which I can't find anywhere."

,jldurham6,2007-07-08T04:16Z,"Please seed this and SHARE your bandwidth.  I can't stand it when I upload to people faster than they are sharing.  

I've been trying to get this for 4 days.  I've been upping all day and have sent 700MB and have only received 45MB, I'm at 90% and there have been 3 seeders and 2 leachers with 50-90% that have ""intersting data"".  

Please share!  I'm upping to a guy that has 90% right now at 15k and am getting 5k back, it's a bunch of horse crap, it's always like this.  

I Wish you could only up to people as fast as they will give to you."
,shacky003,2007-09-12T22:50Z,"apparently the guy above me doesn't have a clue as to how torrent networks work with bandwidth throttling.. If you're uploading from someone fast, and they are in return sharing with you, but slowly, could that maybe be that their upload speed (your dl from them) is capped at say 1 10th of their available dl (you're upload) speed? Do you know how typical home broadband is capped? Someone needs to quit bitching and read a book.."
,user1238,2009-07-22T09:24Z,this torrent seems to be dead. stopped at 77% a couple days ago with no seeders.
