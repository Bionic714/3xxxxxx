,daemonzx66,2005-01-18T04:44Z,"the KAA is MUCH better. But I'm still not fully happy with it, as it says it has an English audio stream as well as the Japanese, but it really only has Japanese. The subtitles are from the DVD though, so they are much more senseful and they are actually timed right. For now, everybody please download the KAA one."
