,alienMOAC,2009-04-28T03:03Z,"@ chris:
if those other ppl didnt help you, DL µtorrent. it has a tab that disp;lays the files you DL'd. you can double-click those. if you don't want to get the (better) client then you can always 'open directory' button, usually on the top of the window. this will open the folder you saved all your DL'd torrents to. just find the one you want and go from there."
