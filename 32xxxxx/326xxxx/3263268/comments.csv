,cosmowalrus,2007-04-15T02:17Z,help! i cant figure out how to install this
,cohbie,2007-05-11T08:50Z,"I really do not suggest using this torrent. Time Warner and the Entertainment Software Association are monitoring it. I was contacted by my ISP today saying that the ""Anti-Piracy Operations"" contacted them on TW's behalf stating that my IP address was caught ""offering unauthorized copies to others"" this very title. This proves to me that torrents are not exactly safe (all torrent clients display IP info of peers). Sad considering I downloaded this because my retail CD was scratched and I have recently been playing all *Quest and Larry games that I own. Since they only alleged that I was providing to others, I guess seeding this one is not a good idea."

For other questions (doeth thith work on Vithta durrrr hurf durf) you need to learn a mantra. Repeat this after me:

GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND!
GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND!

Repeat until you get it."

""Larry 7: Balcony lockup Error
This problem is generally caused by a sound card lockup with the game. Try pressing one of your Function Keys when Larry jumps from the balcony. The Function Keys will produce bodily function sounds instead of the sound that is causing this lockup. 

It is also best to make sure that you are loading the most recent drivers for your sound card. The drivers are the software that controls the hardware on your system. Driver updates are usually free if you can download them from the manufacturer's Web site. Updated drivers will often help your system run more efficiently.

In Windows XP, if the game crashes soon after you get out of the handcuffs, Scott Dickens suggests this: run Notepad, load up the game's resource.win file (usually located in C:\Sierra\LSL7\resource.win). Change ""useDirectSound"" from ""false"" to ""true"" and save the file"""
,moahain1000,2009-09-12T19:05Z,"MESSAGE FOR TIME WARNER etc.:
If Time Warner is monitoring this, then I hope they read my comment now: I WANT TO FUCKING BUY THIS GAME!!!! I WOULD even pay 80 US$+ for it, if I could buy it in a local store in Switzerland. Instead of that I can only buy crap like World Of Warcraft or FARCRY and such new bullshit! If you bring back the old games in stores I WOULD LOVE TO BUY THEM!!! "
,moahain1000,2009-09-12T19:09Z,"This FUCKING CRAP:

Even if I WOULD BUY (and I'd love to) - I can't !!!"

,wshfaster,2010-06-27T20:00Z,1. First Install Daemon tools Then Mount the Larry 7 BIn/Cue file.. 
,wshfaster,2010-07-09T08:11Z,"2. Run the Larry Installer. When asked to Choose the CD-ROM Drive, choose the same Drive you chose to mount the BIN/CUE file."
,wshfaster,2010-07-09T08:11Z,"3. After Installing, the Leisure Suit Larry 7 shortcut should be in your start menu. To open it manually, open the Sierra folder in program files and run the \""SIERW5\"" Application.rn"
