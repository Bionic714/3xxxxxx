,backdrop,2004-12-12T17:06Z,Den här är rätt kul.... De gjorde en ny liten grej live på BBC News för två veckor sedan ang. 20årsdagen av Bhopal-katastrofen i Indien.
,Norvegia,2004-12-12T17:12Z,"On the upper left side of the picture there are some numbers showing the playback lenght or something; were they on the original source? If so, where has this film been taken from?"
,Norvegia,2004-12-12T17:13Z,"Oops, the numbres are on the upper RIGHT side."
,rahim,2004-12-12T17:21Z,"The numbers are (or used to be) typical on screeners. You also see these ""Property of MGM.."" messages every now and then. 
Great movie, thanks."
,Norvegia,2004-12-12T17:29Z,"Yes, I've figured out right know when the ""Property of MGM... "" message has appeared.

Anyway, looks promising :)"
,knarkMarkus,2004-12-13T17:37Z,"Är detta verkligen en SCREENER ? det ska visst finnas en DVDRip och den borde ju vara mkt bättre kvalitet på, någon som vet?"
,Norvegia,2004-12-13T22:53Z,"@knarkMarkus

Don't know if you're asking about the video quality, but if it is so, I can tell you that it is quite good. I've already deleted it, but if I'm not wrong it was 512x384."
,knarkMarkus,2004-12-14T16:39Z,"@above

The quality is good for a screener... yes"
,Lhury,2005-01-31T09:21Z,"Please, SEED this!!"
,danman83,2005-08-16T21:06Z,Please seed just a little bit more. I'm on 90.2%
,quimkaos,2009-05-09T07:19Z,and it's a MGM film....
,murrambingi,2010-07-26T12:40Z,"The quality is very good, but when i got the torrent from the home page of pb it showed me it came from: 

The.Yes.Men.Fix.The.World.P2P.Edition.2010.Xvid-VODO

So my question is that, if i seed it which i am now, will it still become seeded?
Or should i stop seeding?"
