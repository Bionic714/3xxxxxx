,SHIRASE,2004-12-26T02:34Z,"Converting to AVI is easy:
Open the files with VirtualDubMod
Extract the audio stream (OGG format), and convert to MP3, AAC, or what ever you want.
Add the recompressed audiostream and deselect the exsisting OGG encoded audio.
Save as AVI

Making a MPEG or DVD version (MPEG2) is a bit more involved, and the video quality will be degraded. The recompression of the audio also means that the quility is degraded, however I included that stage as my guess is you want the movie to play on a standalone player, and most of the time these devices does not support OGG."
