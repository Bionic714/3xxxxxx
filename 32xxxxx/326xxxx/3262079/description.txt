New version! I have fixed some bugs and made the progress bars cooler.

TL is a multi-tabbed browser accomodated especially for the needs of BitTorrent users. You can search several 

tracker sites simultaneously and browse them individually. You can of course add your own favorites. 

TL is - and will always be - FREEWARE! I have written the program for my own personal use and share it gladly. In 

the program is information on how to obtain notification of future upgrades. 

The file is not large, so please share it when you are done downloading. 

If you have an older version (1.0.1-1.0.3) installed, the installation package asks if you want to remove or repair. 

Choose remove and then run the package again to do a fresh install.
