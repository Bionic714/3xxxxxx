,Szimen,2007-03-21T22:47Z,"EVERYBODY WHO WONDERS HOW TO PLAY DOWNLOADED GAMECUBE GAMES: OPTION 1. Get ""Dolphin"" gamecube emulator at www.dolphin-emu.com/downloads.php AND PLAY WITH A .GCM FILE (ISO=GCM just rename the file if it's an iso file) but this laggs aLOT, because of the custom processor in the GC processes things differently than a computer processor. The 450mHz GC processer doesn't lagg. A P4 4500mHz does. You get max 10 fps, it isn't worth the try.
OPTION 2. Get yourself a modchip, e.g Viper GC Extreme . This needs to be soldered inside your cube, and voids warranty. Also you need to buy mini DVD's and if you don't have one - a REGULAR DVD-RW drive. Burn the downloaded iso to the disc, and follow the modchip instructions. again - .gcm=.iso
To play on emulator rename to .gcm, to burn, rename to .iso"

,ranto1,2008-07-06T17:02Z,"has anyone actually tried to burn this? the emulator is out of the question, they didnt develop an emulator that works well enough yet.."
,ranto1,2008-07-06T22:51Z,"i just burned it in a dvd-r, and it plays just fine on my modded NTSC Wii.. the only problem is it freezes when i press D-pad up in dungeons (to see dungeon map). im pretty sure it should work on a modded gamecube if you burn it onto a mini DVD"
,Help11,2008-07-21T12:38Z,"I get an error when I try to extract it using winrar. It says "" the archive is either in an unknown format or damaged"". Could somebody help me? "
,mison2005,2008-10-24T05:24Z,"Excuse me, but this contains a whole lot of zip files (no, not ISO's) and there are approximatley 25 zip files, but all of them contains an ISO. What do I do with these?"

,Felony69,2010-06-03T00:05Z,"Hi guys... GC Noob here. So far every GC download I get I can't mount or burn to disk. I get the whole 1 Gig ISO file, and typically I can see the contents of a file with Magic ISO or Daemon Tools, but I don't see anything. I burn a disk but no content gets burned, just 1 Gig of ""nothing"" on the disk. What am I doing wrong? I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit.
Thanks in advance!"
