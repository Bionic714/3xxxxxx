          | Link living a peaceful life on a tiny island. One day,   |
          | Link witnesses a huge, menacing bird that snatches       |
          | Link`s younger sister and flies away with her. Link      |
          | follows in hot pursuit. His search for her sets in       |
          | motion an epic adventure that will have Link sailing the |
          | high seas and searching for answers to the mystery       |

          | No, you won't be able to play this game on your GC, at   |
          | least for now. But we thought software and hardware      |
          | hackers would be interested in a GC release for various  |
          | reasons, so here it is.                                  |
          |                                                          |
          | For this first one, we decided to give you a pure disc   |
          | dump. But on a GC disc, all the space that's not used is |
          | filled with random garbage, which is bad for compression.|
          | Any upcoming release from us will have that garbage      |
          | removed.                                                 |

          | Coders can have a look at the /maps directory, which     |
          | contains symbols information, pretty usefull for         |
          | reverse-engineering. (Many games have such map files)    |
