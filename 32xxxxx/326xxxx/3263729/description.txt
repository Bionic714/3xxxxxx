OK here's the Dropkick Murphys back in 2000, this is not the whole show as the battery ran out after 40 minutes, they only played another 10 minutes anyway. This is filmed in my usual high standard, enjoy!

Dropkick Murphys-Cathouse Glasgow 5th November 2000 SVCD 40 minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
