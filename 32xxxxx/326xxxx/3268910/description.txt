Review:
Maiku Kamishiro is a high school student who recently lost his adoptive parents and is living alone in a house he recalls from his childhood -- a house he saw on TV during the UFO flap in Onegai Teacher. Miina Miyafuji and Karen Onodera also saw the house on TV and also remember living there as kids. So both (seperately) head out on their own to visit this house. Both claim to be sisters of Maiku and all three have strange, blue eyes. What does it all mean?
