Cancellation isn't a cover up or conspiracy! A straight forward licensing issue.

Following fan campaigns for many years, an announcement was made that Dark Skies would receive a complete series DVD boxset release in October 2007 (presumably for Region 1).[4] However Sony Entertainment subsequently cancelled the release, citing prohibitive music licensing costs.[5]
