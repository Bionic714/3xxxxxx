Approximate playing time 100 min (2x50)
This video contains two separeate documentries. 

In the first one we get to follow a young reqruit by the name of Dean Heggie as he joins up.  This part is about the "basic training", it goes from when he knocks on the door and says "I want the join the Legion Etrange" up to the ceremony where he and his comrades put on their Kepi blanc's 
for the first time.

The second part takes place in French Guinea where the the legioners train in jungle warfare.

This relase was divided into two part since it would have gotten even bigger as just one. The split is between the first and the second part of the movie. There is no real need to see the first part before the second, but I do recommend it.

(ps. sorry about the lousy quality)

Foreign Legion [Laserligt video 80574]VHS-xsi.jpg				1.77 mb
Foreign Legion [Laserligt video 80574]VHS-xsi.nfo				1kb

Both files are encoded with DivX 5.2.1 & MP3

(The reason for the repacking is that now it is only ~0.6GBs compared to the old one that was ~1.4GBs. The quality of this one is slightly better.) The smaller size is achived by using divX instead of MJPEG and by compressing the audio.
