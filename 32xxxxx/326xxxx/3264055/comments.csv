,fat_tony,2006-11-16T18:20Z,"CD one is in the wrong order. CD two is allright

The right order on CD one is:

Overture
Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats
The Naming of Cats
The Invitation to the Jellicle Ball
The Old Gumbie Cat
The Rum Tum Tugger
Grizabella
Bustopher Jones
Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer
Old Deuteronomy
The Jellicle Ball
Grizabella: The Glamour Cat
Midnight (ought be the ending of Grizabella: The Glamour Cat?) 

Best Regards,
Emil"

Tried to rip the DVD to mp3 but ended up with questionable quality so I thank you for this."
,annorlunda45,2007-01-28T23:38Z,"Ok, as fat_tony says, there is something wrong with the filenames. CD2 is ALMOST right, the first file (incorrectly named as Memory) should be renamed to ""The moments of happiness"". As for the first CD fat_tony is correct (almost: his naming of track 7 and 12 should switch places, for example look up the tracklist on www.allofmp3.com). 

The 13:th track on CD1 is a puzzle for me too, so I just deleted it :)"
,Dirty50ck5,2007-04-30T06:19Z,"Just in case anyone is confused by the above comments, the correct track listings can also be found here: http://www.amazon.com/Cats-1981-Original-London-Cast/dp/B000006XI0/ref=sr_1_3/103-4005790-8007842?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1177906715&sr=8-3"
,Dirty50ck5,2007-04-30T21:36Z,"ok, after a lot of work I finally figured out what is up with the track listings:
The tracks should be as follows:
1. Cats/Act 1. Overture
2. Cats/Act 1. Prologue. Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats
3. Cats/Act 1. The Naming of Cats
4. Cats/Act 1. The Invitation to the Jellicle Ball
5. Cats/Act 1. The Old Gumbie Cat
6. Cats/Act 1. The Rum Tum Tugger
7. Cats/Act 1. Grizabella: The Glamour Cat
8. Cats/Act 1. Bustopher Jones
9. Cats/Act 1. Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer
10. Cats/Act 1. Old Deuteronomy
11. Cats/Act 1. The Jellicle Ball
12. Cats/Act 1. Grizabella
13. Cats/Act 1. Memory
Disc: 2
1. Cats/Act 2. The Moments of Happiness
2. Cats/Act 2. Gus: The Theatre Cat
3. Cats/Act 2. Growltiger's Last Stand Including the Ballad of Billy ...
4. Cats/Act 2. Skimbleshanks
5. Cats/Act 2. Macavity
6. Cats/Act 2. Mr. Mistoffelees
7. Cats/Act 2. Memory
8. Cats/Act 2. Journey to the Heavyside Layer
9. Cats/Act 2. The Ad-Dressing of Cats

now what happened here is that ""Prologue. Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats"" was just named prologue and then Jellicle Song was listed as the next track by itself, throwing off the entire scheme for the first disc. Rename track 2 appropriately then bump each title up to the one above it for all of CD1 and then rename the last track on CD1 Memory. Then the first track of CD2 needs to be renamed ""The Moments of Happiness"". Ok, I think that covers it."
