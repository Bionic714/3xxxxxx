In the twisted Room Zoom manor, use everything under the roof to hone your driving skills and take the checkered flag. We put you in the driver's seat of toy cars to race at break-neck speeds through every room in the house, including a spooky lab and a hidden tomb. Eight fully interactive environments, with unrestricted driving areas and hidden tracks, make each race a driving adventure.

Room Zoom offers arcade-style racing in an environment that changes with every lap. In each room, objects are at your disposal to push, bump or blow up to deter your opponents and unlock hidden keys. Gather power-ups along the way to help defend against aggressive drivers. Drive unrestricted house and find secret passages that may be a shortcut to the finish.
