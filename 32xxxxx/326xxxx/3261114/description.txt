notes: Ok, iNNSYN released this, but they stripped all 
            nordic audios to keep video untouched? Well, how 
            about stripping those crap games and unused 
            scenes instead, and keep all audiotracks, and 
            still keep video untouched? Good idea, so we 
            did it. Also most extras still on disc, i suggest 
            you take a look at "Gone Nutty", if you do remember 
            the little fellow from ice age =) Have fune, and 
          enjoy this real nordic disc! 

          ENJOY
