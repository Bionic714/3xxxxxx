,stakyr,2005-06-18T08:28Z,"The game works but Windows are incombatible with it. You will have problems like freezing, while playing. Try it if you want it for your collection."

,bigpaja,2006-01-27T17:56Z,"The problem with this torrent is that I could find it only here on Pirate Bay. If it were also available on other torrent search sites, there would be much more seeders. Well, more than zero."
,bigpaja,2006-01-27T23:52Z,Better get myself an original copy on E-Bay.

,Nostradamu5,2008-10-31T11:59Z,"Anyone who has a problem running this on Windows XP, you can download the Playstation version ISO and a Playstation emulator. The emulator will let your computer act as if it were a Playstation, and by doing this I've been able to play games like Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain and Final Fantasy 7. If you try the PC versions of these on Windows XP they are buggy and hardly ever play flawlessly, most of the time with missing videos. Emulating the playstation versions I have been able to play them flawlessly with minimal graphical errors and increased performance."
,zackzeals,2008-11-23T20:42Z,is this an exact .iso of an original game copy. if so is it possible to burn this as an image and play in playstation?
,Evoss-X,2009-04-19T15:07Z,"Hi
How to run this old shit in Win 7  ?
thnx ;)"
,FrostyC,2009-05-31T20:56Z,Should work great on my Win98/Damn Small Linux Gaming box! Thanks for the up!
,CidSilverWing,2009-07-24T17:53Z,"This download is a FRAUD.

The setup refuses to let you change the install directory, that's why it whines about your C:\ drive not having enough room. I couldn't change it and the letters just kept glitching."
,trampler,2009-11-28T20:21Z,*WORKS* on XP!
,Gubrej,2010-02-06T21:37Z,"Thanks a lot JayTheHated I've been longing for this on my PC(finished playing blood omen2, SR 1&2, Defiance)... Just finished installing, honestly it works in XP... With the help with this site's update of the game you can run it on XP.

http://home.comcast.net/~heavyweights/games/kain/index.htm... 

Install the game normally,( too bad I can only manage to install it on C:\Program Files\Kain) then make sure the patch from the site above is installed in the same directory or folder as the game itself(EqC:\Program Files\Kain)

After that you can now play the game even w/o the cd.

,LiveInABox,2010-09-20T22:32Z,Im getting this not enough disc space to install....It does let me change the directory of install but both drives its saying not enough space even though i have over 50gb in both...how do i get past that?
,LiveInABox,2010-09-21T00:43Z,never mind it works great. the only problem is the game speed seems like its in slow mo...I know it shouldnt be anyway to fix that?
,DigFunk,2010-10-20T06:30Z,"CidSilverWing doesn't know what he's talking about, this DL works perfect(You need to know what you're doing, obviously). I'm only to nupraptor's keep because I've been delaying playing this, but it's worked fine so far. As for the speed, try this trainer: http://nosgothica.org/soft/BO_trainer.zip  it's a DL but one option when playing using this trainer is ""boost"",it boosts the speed of the game"
,LWekkyon,2010-11-12T17:45Z,"With the patch installed it works fine. 
Thank you!"
,GObonzo,2012-03-28T21:14Z,"too bad cidsilverding is an idiot and can't figure out how to manually enter a target.
if too fps too high just limit CPU to around 1ghz.
game will run but still can't access videos. thought there was a patch to convert video to a different format so new Windows can run them."
