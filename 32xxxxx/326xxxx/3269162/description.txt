Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen

The original game in the series from 1996(PSX)/1997(PC). In my opinion the best in the series.

This ISO contains all the videos and sound and generally everything that is lacking in those stupid CD-Rips. Taking away the videos to this game means ripping away the entire story :<

There is a problem playing this game on Win2k and above, since it tries to access Video Drivers directly which is not allowed in Win2k or Windows XP, but I have a fix and will be uploading a torrent for it right after this.

*edit* The fix can be found <a href=http://thepiratebay.com/torrents-details.php?id=3269165&hit=1>here</a>

Enjoy!
