These are our new installers and our new emulator v1.10 which are all

    found on the DVD release.  This is ONLY for those who have downloaded

    our previous CD version.  This upgrade will fix any remaining issues

    during offline/firewalled installation and play.  It will also enable

    online play for cracked servers of CS: Source and enable you to host

    games as well.  The upgraded emulator will also improve gameplay as

    you will read below.


    This release is simply the contents of the /VENGEANCE/ directory from

    the DVD, so as you follow the steps, when it says "from the VENGEANCE

    directory on the DVD", just use the files in this upgrade.


    Read the NFO carefully and follow exact instructions. Good luck.
