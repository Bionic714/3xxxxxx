,trikztar,2004-12-20T19:26Z,Probably the best rpg ever - those of you who like rpg's and haven't tried this do yourself a favour and grab it!
,Hydrax,2004-12-20T19:45Z,I can only confirm that this is the best pcgame ever!!!
,SwedishMilk,2004-12-20T20:29Z,"Mycket bra spel. Mindra bra torrent. Du har inte bara includerat en del onödiga Save-filer, en inofficiell expansion som i mitt tycke är värdelös utan dessutom ""NWN-Hordes of the Underdark"" som i och för sig är bra men som inte har något med BG 2 att göra. Allt det blir runt 1 extra GB. :thumbsdown:"
,Z0mbie,2004-12-21T01:55Z,someone seed this?
,rwepofjk,2005-01-19T20:08Z,Pretty much the best single player game I have ever played. Finished it many times and still finding new stuff.
