Koukaku Kidoutai 1.5 Human-Error Processor 『攻殻機動隊』 [E-Manga] (GiTS)</B>

This contains four episodes that were never released, on an e-manga CD. 

The 4 episodes are:

-Fat Cat (1991) -Drive Slave (1992) -Mines of Mind (1995) -Lost Past (1996)

The manga and the CD both contain the full stories of each episode. However, the CD combines images with music, giving the manga an anime feel. The CD also contains a special screensaver as a bonus. The CD will work in English windows (XP and NT) and Mac (OS 9 or higher).

This torrent includes the CD-ROM version of this as the manga can be found elsewhere.

Do note, you will probably need to go into your Control Panel and enable support for Asian Languages to run this cd (and possibly enable Non-Unicode support to Japanese) or else it will give you a Shockwave error. 

To add, this is RAW and is in Japanese.. however the CD-ROM Menus are in English.
