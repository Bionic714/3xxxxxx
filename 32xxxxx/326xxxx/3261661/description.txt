Vars√•goda!

These albums are in my opinion essential if you like jazz, progressive or any unconventional and groovy music. 
All albums are picked by Draugei, as a result of years of searching and collecting at Soulseek, Direct Connect etcetera. They are not selected for any other reason than being great albums, but they somehow show the progression from avant-garde jazz, merging with folk music and progressive rock, transforming into present day electronic jazz and progressive metal.

No longer is there any valid excuse for not having these albums! I think you'd want this collection.

The albums included are:
------------------------
Miles Davis - In a Silent Way
Michal Urbaniak - Fusion
Nucleus - Labyrinth, Elastic Rock
Kebnekajse - Electric Mountain
Jaga Jazzist - A livingroom hush
Sun Ra - Secrets of the Sun
Mahavishnu Orchestra - Inner Mounting Flame, Bird of Fire
Dave Holland Quartet - Conference of the Birds
John Coltrane - My Favourite Things
King Crimson - In the Wake of Poseidon
Jazz Mandolin Project - Jungle Tango
Jan Johansson with Georg Riedel and Rune Gustafsson - Live in Tallinn 
Cynic - Focus

And a few songs:
National Health - Parcivalus
Cherry Five - Country Graveyard
-----------------------------

I would argue that Nucleus and Mahavisnhu Orchestra are the two central groups in this transformation. Check out Cynic as well, calling them progressive would be a severe understatement.

You can find more of these artists at Soulseek, the Direct Connect hub [Fallen Angel] or perhaps (doubtfully) at your record store. If you want  to learn more about the artists, check http://www.ubl.com
