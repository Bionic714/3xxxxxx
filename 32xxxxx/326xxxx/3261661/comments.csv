,mrsky,2005-06-23T16:41Z,"Thanks for everything else but cynic. WTF is it doing there.. did you misplace the album or do you use words jazz, progressive, or groovy in some unconventional way?
It was terrible. Monophonic and agressive. Everything else was a complete hit. "
,Animalis,2005-07-07T16:58Z,"Anybody who loves Cynic, try Atheist's album ""Elements""...it is even more aggressive but wit plenty of jazz elements.
Jazz Mandolin Project is great, cheers"

,stratosfear,2008-01-25T18:03Z,Fusion @ 128 Kbps??  What a waste of bandwith.  If I had known the bitrate was so low (128-192) I wouldn't have bothered.  Duh.
,milksounds,2008-04-15T00:25Z,"1.  Thanks for putting this together.  Really glad I found it as I'm just discovering Jazz.
2.  I also don't understand why Cynic is here.
3.  Tags were ridiculously all over the place.  I don't know if you had changed them and they didn't save or what.
4.  Finally, @stratosfear, as they were collected off SoulSeek and Direct Connect, what did you expect really?  Either way, it's great for trying our some new music before buying."
