Oasis- a movie from Lee Chang-dong who also made Peppermint candy.
Sometimes painful to watch, but well worth it.

Chong-du (Seol Gyeong-Gu) is a jittery, wiry man with an extremely short attention span whose level of energy sometimes borders on the psychotic. He returns home after serving a sentence for vehicular manslaughter, only to be treated with contempt by family members and ostracized by friends. 

Oasis'' portrays a surprising and at times disturbing romance between a man convicted of vehicular homicide and a woman with cerebral palsy. It is the first domestic film to win a major award at the Venice festival in 15 years, since Kang Su-yon won best actress for Im Gweon-taek's `Ssibaji'' (The Surrogate Womb) in 1987. Since ``Ssibaji,'' many domestic films, such as Lies by Jang Seon-Wu and The Isle by Kim Gi-Deok have been screened at the competition section of the festival, but were not given any awards.
