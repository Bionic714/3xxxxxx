You will find it here:   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82303&package_id=84358 

I also recomend the ""alternative Realplayer"" and the ""alternative Quicktimeplayer"", both to be found at sourceforge.net for viewing real respectively quicktime format video/audio.

Some people recomend VLC player. I havent found a single file that i couldnÂ´t play with Mediaplayerclassic yet, so i havenÂ´t tried it. But if you get no luck with MPC, try googling for VLC or VideoLanPlayer.

Good luck!"
