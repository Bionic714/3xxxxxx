NOTES : ok, listen up. When it comes to movies like this one, 
you just can't have it all. We wanted to keep both 
DTS and DD5.1 on this one, but something had to pay 
for that, this time menu on disc2 had to go. Keeping 
menu on disc2 would leave us only 2880 bitrate, and 
we know some people would freak out cause of that. 
GOOGLE did a "easy" solution by splitting 2 discs 
to 4 discs, we didnt think this was a good solution. 

If menu on disc2 is that important for you, we 
suggest you go buy this great movie! Our solution 
on this rip is what we though would be best for 
most of you out there, and we hope you will 
enjoy it.
