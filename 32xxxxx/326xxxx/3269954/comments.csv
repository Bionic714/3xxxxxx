,sonof,2005-01-13T15:00Z,"I take back my words.

What was the point on taking away finnish subtitles >:(

WOW you saved 3Mb with that... now you must be very proud of yourself.

Asshole!"
,Andy19230,2005-01-18T17:23Z,"The movie's quality sucks. Really fucking worthless torrent. I agree with Sonof about the subs, its not worth it to exclude them. But the quality is shitty so it doesn't really matter. 

Cheers, fuckers!"
,sonof,2005-01-19T14:12Z,"I understand you tstrom66 because you obviously don't know that this movie has all other subtitles (SE, NO, DK) left but not finnish... and that's sorta racism that pisses me off.

The uploader could atleast have informed about that in release info.

And the video quality is indeed pretty bad. If you guys don't know how to use Cinema Craft Encoder then you should use DVDShrink 3.2 which is very easy to use and creates pretty decent quality."
