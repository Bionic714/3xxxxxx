 The evil Krank and his henchmen have been made by a mad scientist. Krank's
 problem is that he is tormented by his inability to dream. He finds it necessary
 to try to steal the dreams of children, but since they fear him, he only gets
 their nightmares. When a circus strongman's little brother is kidnapped, the
 strongman (One) tracks him down and, with the help of some other eccentric
 characters, tries to put an end to the evil reign of Krank and his Cyclops army.
