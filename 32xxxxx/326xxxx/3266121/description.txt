          | Time passes, the pages turn...and a new chapter unfolds  |
          | in an unfamiliar land! Get ready for a two-dimensional   |
          | role-playing adventure for the ages as Mario returns to  |
          | paper form in pursuit of a threat unlike any he's ever   |
          | faced.  This time around, more emphasis is placed on the |
          | paper abilities of Mario and his friends. He can turn    |
          | sideways to slip through cracks, fold into a paper       |
          | airplane to fly, roll into a tube, and much more. He can |
          | also use tons of items like hammers and thunderbolts.    |

          | Tested with Loader 1.0,  works great, we are wondering   |
          | what kind of morons IGN has working for them to attack   |
          | this game based on "Presentation" and because no texture |
          | work...blah blah whatever they can pull out of their     |
          | asses lately on biased reviews... wish Gamefan was back. |
          | All this negativity about the gamecube scene, really     |
          | makes us sad. We try to do whatever we can to at least   |
          | bring some momentum, you can always trust us, we have    |
          | the tools to know if an image is properly done that will |
          | work correctly now, or even with future builds of the    |
          | loader, or (gasp!) a modchip.  Don't want to start       |
          | pointing the dirty fingers out there to many damaged     |
          | images... we'll let the kids figure that one out.        |
          | Oh, we didn't password protect this one due to many user |
          | errors by lots of fserving, torrent seeding cutting n    |
          | pasting my name lame fucks out there, just know where it |
          | came from at least, thx.                                 |
