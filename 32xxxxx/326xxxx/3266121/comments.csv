,Siggens,2007-04-17T16:41Z,"I don't get this too work! I have tried it on my Wii with wiikey installed, but it doesn't seem to work at all.. I have burnt with 2.4X, so that shouldn't bee the problem... All of the Wii games I have tried, has worked so far, didn't think it was different on yhid?"
,ManiKatti,2007-07-27T03:39Z,"Verified: Working.

@Siggens: I hate it when people complain they can't get Gamecube games working on a Key' d or Ninja'd Wii. A Wii and a Gamecube are two completely different consoles. Either get a modded Gamecube or go back to Wii games. Even you yourself said that Wii games work fine. You never mentioned about Gamecube games."
,Seolik,2007-09-09T16:33Z,Seed please i really want this one.
,Seolik,2007-09-09T17:24Z,Seeda snälla non .
,scatman839,2008-01-29T11:54Z,"Works perfectly fine on a PAL Wii, latest firmware and 1.9g wiikey update.

Had to use GCOS before running and turn on some multiregion thing though.

Works with progressive as well."
,Quenox,2008-02-21T02:03Z,"@ManiKatti: don't bash the guy for asking, shows how much you know.
@Siggens: go to tehskeen.com and look around the wii section. You should find the multigame iso creator and GCOS, you can use them to make a single dvd with multiple gamecube games."
,furtherdown,2008-05-25T09:29Z,"@AgentNuts: I see your mommy went and used up all her money on crack, so you're stuck with only one game console.  Tell that bitch to lay off the pipe and get her ass out curbside.  She can suck a few extra dicks tonight and start saving for your Wii."
,luigeman4life,2009-05-06T22:30Z,how do i open it?
,Fawlks,2009-06-04T23:34Z,"would this run on dolphi emulator? and if so, how ? should i just open it?"
,kotelett,2009-07-25T20:46Z,What is the sfv.-file for?
,Ynitsed,2009-09-29T22:17Z,Could someone clearly explain how to get this to work?
,Spironic,2011-01-29T03:16Z,"This game is fucking BOSS.

My favorite of the Paper Marios."
,eric43212,2011-02-02T03:58Z,does this work on the computer
,SomeKidBen,2011-03-29T00:17Z,"Work perfect at solid 30 FPS on dolphin emulator, although there tend to be quit a few visual glitches but playable none the less."
,bhutan_6,2011-07-31T21:32Z,Great torrents. Thanks. I have a request to everyone. Can you upload 2 rare Gamecube games (NTSC-U) Star wars rouge squadron 2: rouge leader and Prince of persia: sands of time in Piratebay. Thx in advance. Both of the games are in IGN's all time 25 best GC games list. 
,I-Fatman,2012-03-14T12:25Z,"It works like a charm. I have PAL Wii and had to use GECKO OS loader because it's NTSC.

@Siggens try that if nothing else works for you."
,simba8000,2012-04-26T02:32Z,"@ManiKatti the wii is designed to run gamecube games too, but nothing else."
