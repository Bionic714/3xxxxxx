 Install Notes (Please follow these instructions IN ORDER)



   1. Unpack the release with WinRAR or equivalent



   2. *WARNING* It is STRONGLY recommended to run this patch from the same 

                HDD or partition as where you installed the game. And we

                STRONGLY recommend closing all other applications before

                running this patch.      

                

      Run patch.exe and follow the steps until asked for the destination

      directory use:

 

        "<install directory>SteamApps"



         <install directory> being where you installed the game.



         *** EXAMPLE **************************************************

 

         If "C:Program FilesValveSteam" is where you installed the 

         game then the following would be the destination directory for 

         the patch:



         "C:Program FilesValveSteamSteamApps"

 

         **************************************************************



      Then once you have chosen the correct directory, continue following the

      on-screen instructions and START the patch.



      Your GCF's MUST be the exact ones from the Protocol v7 Update. 

      If for any reason YOU have modified these files, this patch WILL NOT 

      work for you.

 

      DO NOT interrupt this process and the patch WILL be succesful after

      some minutes, depending on your processor speed.  BE PATIENT.



   3. BACKUP your "steamemu.ini" files from the following folders if you

      have previously enabled online play for legit servers:



       <installdir>SteamAppsUserHalf-Life 2 Deathmatchsteamemu.ini

       <installdir>SteamAppsUserCounter-Strike Sourcesteamemu.ini



      If you do not perform this backup, you will have to edit the .ini files

      again after the update (as explained in step 5 and 6).



   4. Once the patch has been installed succesfully, go to the HL2Installer

      folder and double click "hl2install.exe".  This will update the needed

      game files for you.  And do not worry, your save files wont be harmed.

   

      hl2intall will put the the game back into offline mode so read the

      OFFLINE/ONLINE mode section to go back into ONLINE mode.

         

      Next, go to the CSSInstaller folder and double click "cssinstaller.exe".

      This will update the needed CS: Source files for you.



      Finally, go to the HL2DMInstaller folder and double click 

      "hl2dminstaller.exe".  This will update the needed HL2: DM files for you.





      YOU MUST RUN ALL 3 INSTALLERS AGAIN! SO DO NOT TRY TO SKIP STEPS.



   

   5. Replace your "steamemu.ini" backups to their respective folders to

      re-enable the games' online features for legit servers.



      If you fucked up your backups and you can't play on legit servers follow

      this step again.



      *OPTIONAL STEP TO ENABLE ONLINE PLAY ON -ANY- SERVERS*

      *CRACKED SERVERS STILL FUNCTIONAL WITHOUT THIS STEP*



      For those people who wish to play online on ANY servers, legit or

      cracked, you must first run STEAM from your start menu: 



         Start -> Programs -> Valve -> Steam -> Steam



      Click "Create a new account..." and follow the on-screen steps to do so.



      You MUST create a NEW account which does NOT have any games subscribed.

      

      Once you have created your account, minimize STEAM to the system tray,

      while REMAINING LOGGED IN.



      Then, go to "<install directory>SteamAppsUserCounter-Strike Source",

      in explorer, open the file "steamemu.ini".



      Here you will see a section for enabling online play:



       ; Enable online Steam play

       ; This enables the ability to play Half-Life 2: Deathmatch and Counter-Strike: Source on any server.

       ; Log in to the Valve Steam client with a valid steam account (no subscriptions to games needed)

       ; And enter the Steam information here

       ; For example:

       ;  SteamOnline=1

       ;  SteamUser=MySteamUser

       ;  SteamPassword=MySteamPassword

       SteamOnline=0

       SteamUser=

       SteamPassword=



      First, change "SteamOnline=0" to "SteamOnline=1".

      

      Second, since you have a new account now, use your new Username and Password

      and write them into the steamemu.ini file and SAVE.



         *** EXAMPLE **************************************************

 

         Your new username is "BOB" and your password is "dolomite".



         Your .ini file should look like the following to play online:



               ;  SteamOnline=1

               ;  SteamUser=MySteamUser

               ;  SteamPassword=MySteamPassword

               SteamOnline=1

               SteamUser=BOB

               SteamPassword=dolomite



         **************************************************************





      Repeat the .ini file editing for the steamemu.ini file found in

      "<install directory>SteamAppsUserHalf-Life 2 Deathmatch" as well,

      to re-enable HL2: DM online legit server play.





         *** REMINDER *************************************************



         Each time you want to play online on LEGIT SERVERS, you MUST 

         have STEAM running and you MUST be logged into the same 

         account as found in the steamemu.ini file!



         Mind you, this is the same thing as running steamengine.exe

         from the EMPORiO release and the same information is exchanged.



         Otherwise, if you ONLY want to play on cracked servers, you

         DO NOT need STEAM running at all.

        *** SHORTCUT NOTICE *******************************************



        Our installers will make shortcuts ONLY to the REAL location

        where windows believes the desktop is.  If you have played

        around with the desktop using TweakUI or other programs, you

        may not see the shortcuts on your "desktop" which is NOT where

        windows thinks the desktop actually is.  So, follow these

        instructions to make your own shortcut:



        For Half-Life 2:



        "<install dir>SteamAppsUserHalf-Life 2hl2.exe" -steamlocal

 

        For Counter-Strike Source:

    

        "<install dir>SteamAppsUserCounter-Strike Sourcehl2.exe" -steam -game cstrike



        For Half-Life 2 Deathmatch:

    

        "<install dir>SteamAppsUserHalf-Life 2 Deathmatchhl2.exe" -steam -game hl2mp





        <install dir> being wherever you installed the game obviously.



         



        *** OFFLINE / ONLINE MODE *************************************

         

         --- ONLINE ---        

        

         Double click the file "Steam Online.reg" to put the game in 

         ONLINE mode.

 

         Make sure your internet connection is active and the needed

         ports to play CS: Source are open (or turn firewalls off).

         Same for HL2:DM.



         --- OFFLINE ---



         Double click the file "Steam Offline.reg" to put the game in 

         OFFLINE mode.



        ---------------------------------------------------------------



         The game MUST be in ONLINE mode to play Counter-Strike Source

         on cracked servers, or to host a cracked server, and you 

         obviously must be connected to the internet. Same for, legit

         servers and HL2:DM.



         OFFLINE mode is for those who do not have a constant internet 

         connection or for those who do not want any contact with VALVE

         servers and want to play Half-Life 2. 



         Remember that OFFLINE mode will disable Counter-Strike Source 

         online capabilities. So if you want to play online, follow

         the instructions above to enable ONLINE mode. Same for HL2:DM.



         Remember, STEAM only must be logged in and running if you wish

         to play CS: Source on legit servers. Otherwise, you do not

         need STEAM to be on at all. Same for HL2:DM.
