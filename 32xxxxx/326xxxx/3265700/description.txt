Uzumaki aka Twister aka Vortex

I am a huge fan of the comic which was strangely addictive, I myself was becoming mesmerized by the spirals. The town where the movie is based is affected by a spiral curse driving people insane and causing very strange incidents to occur. The movie has great visuals but fails to tell the story as well as the books do. There is so much the movie left out, so much explaining that needed to be done. The movie I feel never ended. It's hard to give an example without excluding any spoilers. Overall it's a beautifully weird movie and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Outre. It can be compared visually to Tim Burton, David lynch or Jean Pierre-Juenet (city of lost children, Amelie).
