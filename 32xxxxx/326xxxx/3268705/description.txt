Rudolpho sells the Tulip to Max and his wife, Zelda, who decide to turn the ship into a prison. Dante and Luc pretend that they would rather work for Max than work for Rudolpho. Meanwhile, Percy is creating problems on the ship so that Max will believe the Tulip is under too much disrepair for it to be a profitable prison. Luc and Dante seek "help" from the Orchard.
