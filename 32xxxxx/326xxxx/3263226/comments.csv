,coolbackto,2004-12-14T22:30Z,"was a bug in the tracker :/

,zcorvine9,2007-07-03T02:07Z,"Thanks CB2.  Not sure if you're seeding or other people are, but it's good to see that people are still seeding after almost 3 years.

I am currently seeding right now but it doesn't seem like there are any takers.  If anyone needs a seeder, inbox me if such a thing exists on pbay [^_^]"
