,Ghengis-Khan,2008-01-25T05:54Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!

Keygen.exe contains Obfustat.IFV  virus!!!

Once infected, Quickbooks sends the person who made the virus all of your information!!!"
,itworks22,2008-11-05T16:09Z,"This copy works absolutely fine - no scares at all.

I created a CD using Nero 7 but it could have been loaded by virtual CD (using say Magic ISO).

However, after all that, it is the US version and I was looking for the UK version !

KeyGen.exe always appears as a virus to anti-virus software, but its not. Dont accuse the uploader if you dont know your stuff.

Copy works great, however I cant get the KeyGen open. It says ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."" But Im this computer's administrator. I have full privelages.

Anybody who can answer this it would be much appreciated. Thanks!
