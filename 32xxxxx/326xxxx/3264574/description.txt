OK here's a Bad Religion show fromRock Im Park in 1998, this is a great gig and they do some excellent versions of some of their less played songs. I don't know the exact date but i'm sure someone will, enjoy!

Bad Religion-Rock Im Park Germany 1998 SVCD 39m

These are in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and they will play in most DVD players. They will fit on 2 80min blank cd-r using nero.

Enjoy bandit999
