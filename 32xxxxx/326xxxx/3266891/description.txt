Something remarkable happened in 1947 in the small, desert town of Roswell, New Mexico. A UFO crash was announced by the army--and just as quickly retracted. 

Rumors circulated for many years. But the most remarkable development in the Roswell story came with the recent discovery of sensational footage supposedly showing an autopsy of an alien being. See video files of the entire autopsy footage, plus a fascinating documentary produced by the BBC.
