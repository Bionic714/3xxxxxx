Godfrey Entertainment and dirt bike superstar Travis Pastrana have teamed up again to film “Travis & The Nitro Circus 2” (“NC2”). In addition to jaw dropping antics by Pastrana, NC2 is stacked with riding action from a who’s who list of the motocross world. This list includes “Cowboy” Kenny Bartram, Nate Adams, Ronnie Renner, Matt Buyten, Drake McElroy, Jesse Olsen, and many others. This year the Godfrey Crew took the riders all over the map in search of new and interesting places to ride. NC2 has been filmed in Hawaii, Austria, Czech Republic, Italy and the USA. Godfrey Entertainment has remained true to its proven formula of interspersing mind-blowing action by top athletes with highly entertaining (and questionable) antics by the legendary Nitro Circus clowns. NC2 contains stunts that have never been attempted before and other stunts which no human should ever try again. This is a great motocross video and also a great dirt bike video!
