,brohken,2009-10-07T16:58Z,"if you're just looking for the PDF, it was seeded quickly from here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5003555/illuminatus_trilogy

The one here, however, includes the HTML, which is much better to be able to reflow the text with on mobile devices. Gasping for a seed!"
,brohken,2009-10-07T20:00Z,"...and the seeders came through! I will seed to you, yes, you!"
