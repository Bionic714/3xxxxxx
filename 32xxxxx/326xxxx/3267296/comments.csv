,Kizo,2004-12-21T17:51Z,"Once I got it, I'll seed for a while."
,CsMbI,2004-12-21T20:59Z,"Could someone RIP the all of the subs and post it?

,shamr0ck,2006-01-20T17:15Z,"This has been prppably made with DVDShrink, and not even tested, it does errors just like the one in this. How should one burn this just ""ignoring any errors"" because the whole burning process stops to the error? This was a waste of bandwidth."
,Ryssen88,2006-01-31T16:44Z,"Same with me , cant burn fucking waste of time "
,fathercarillo,2006-02-22T00:32Z,"I used K3b to burn those files, worked fine after removing VOB-files VTS_02_0...VTS_11_0
 (K3b / mkisofs debugging output informed those files to be the problem)

Thank you very many for the movie
