OK here's a rare video with a real strange mixture of bands, this was originaly released in 1980 and was called "British Rock" then it got re-released in 1992 under the title "Punk And Its After Shocks" this is the version i have, its worth it just for the Clash and SpizzEnergi doing Whers Captain Kirk. I don't know why the Kinks are on there but enjoy it anyway.

CD1 Punk And Its After Shocks 1992 SVCD 41 minutes
CD2 Punk And Its After Shocks 1992 SVCD 41 minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

Enjoy bandit999
