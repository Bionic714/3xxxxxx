,KlingKlang,2005-01-07T17:52Z,"Jo, detta nog en av dom sämsta kvalitéerna som jag har sett. Kanske smart att använda deinterlace på en film som är interlaced? verkar vara en bra film annars.. Aja baja, inte slarva så.. "
,Knakkerpak,2005-02-09T18:04Z,"thank you thank you.
Sorry if I dont speak Swedish (I speak dutch though) ;)
I was looking for this movie for a while.
If anyone has subtitles in english or dutch for this movie it would be great. Otherwise, so be it. I can still enjoy all the gore, the alien and Robo-Cop :D"

"
,Gosu_no_Koroshiya,2006-11-04T22:23Z,"You ""can't"" get a retail copy of this since it has never been officially released because of some copyright issues, although Stardust (I think it was them atleast) were allowed to have ten copies as prizes in a contest. As far as I know these are the only ""legal"" copies of the movie (I could be wrong)."
