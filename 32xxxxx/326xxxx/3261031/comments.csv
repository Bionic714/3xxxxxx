Im not to familure with DVD rips and the nfo file isnt very clear."
,wmempa,2005-07-19T10:03Z,No-one to help me out? Perhaps someone can show me a path to investigate?
,battleguard,2005-07-21T19:17Z,Yo wnempa.. you gotta get winrar and install it.. then extract out the .rar file (or the .r01 if there's no rar) and there ya go..
,wmempa,2005-07-22T11:29Z,"Thanks for the response.

I did that but when it finishes I just get a blank  notepad which never loads.

Perhaps My files got courupted or something?"
,wmempa,2005-07-22T11:31Z,"Yeah I tried again and all i get is a folder with a bin and cue file inside. So im not sure if from there if there is a specific program or what. 

Must just be courupted, imo."
