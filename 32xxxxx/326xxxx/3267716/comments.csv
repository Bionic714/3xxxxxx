Och det händer inget särskilt i kroppen heller (som jag tror dieten hävdar?). Det som händer är att man blir mätt snabbare och inte äter lika mycket som man skulle göra om man åt som vanligt. Mindre mat = mindre kalorier."

Kopierar mitt inlägg från en annan Atkins torrent här på PB. 

Det är på engelska så att lite fler folk förstår budskapet.
Om det är nån som inte förstår engelskan kan jag väl skriva det på svenska också.. =)

Eating food with alot of protein and fat makes you forget about sweet things.. for a while.
The stomach sends signals to the brain when it wants protein and carbonhydrides, that's the biggest reason why we feel hunger and cravings for sweet things.

We can eat a whole table full of food if we just can get it down, but if the food is low on protein we will get hungry soon again. That's why alot of people gain lots of weight eating at fast food restaurants. The food contains lot's of fat, but is low on pure protein, so your hunger comes back after a short while again cause the stomach still sends signals to the brain that it wants protein.

The reason why we often take something sweet after dinner is because the stomach also wants carbonhydrides. 

Carbonhydrides bond water in the body, so if you stop eating food rich of carbonhydrides you'll drop alot of weight.. initially.. 
But combined with a diet that focuses on protein and fat you'll eventually gain that weight again, cause you get fat on the inside. 
Besides from that, too much fat, which the body can't get rid of (cause it takes energy to burn fat, and alot of energy is lost when you don't get enough carbonhydrides) means you'll develop a higher risk to get cancer.
A lot of fat also means that you will get alot of LDL-colestherol in your blood, which affects the heart and veins.

Furthermore.. if you're on a diet which is rich of proteins and low of carbonhydrides you'll have a much higher risk of damaging your kidneys. You'll develop alot of purines as well. Purines are often connected with metabolt syndrome and type 2 diabetes.

Any one with diabetes knows that it's not good for the body with too much proteins and fat. This they know cause they generally know alot more about food's effect on the body, cause of their diabetes.

Without carbonhydrides the body bonds alot less water, which results in loss of water and  ketons. This is particularly damaging to the heart. It leads to dehydration and the loss of ketons lead to heartarythmia.
This is why some deaths have been blamed on the Atkins diet, cause the diet lead to the cause of death.


The Atkins diet is a nice thought.. but it doesn't work in reality, it only damages the body.
People who are overweight sadly are willing to take that risk, cause the diet often makes them drop weight.
Just that in the end they'll gain weight again, and most likely they damaged their bodies enough so that an even stricter diet easily could be fatal.

I'm not saying that Atkins = death!
I'm saying that the diet doesn't work in reality cause there are so many things in the body that takes harm with the diet.. Only in extreme cases could this be fatal.

Now there's only one more thing to add..
Proper nutrition folks.. proper nutrition... =)"
,philippe01,2009-03-18T05:54Z,This diet has been shown to be dangerous...
,cmlegend,2009-12-02T03:46Z,"Lost 40 pounds last year with Atkins and only gain half by eating healthy...

This is da shit !"
,DocEvil,2009-12-22T19:01Z,"@All the Nay-Sayers
Blah blah blah....IT FUCKING WORKS! I've seen the results of this diet in just under a year and it is amazing how much weight somebody can loose from eating this diet. It does not completely deprive you of the nutrients that your body craves, it simply regulats your intake of them.
So, claiming that you are starving the body of vital nutrients is a fallacy that people propose to stop others from getting on to a fad diet.
ATKINS
SIMPLY
WORKS"
,dhsol6321,2010-01-06T22:07Z,"we learned about this in our gifted science class today. By stopping carb intake, your body goes into a state called ketosis. This forces your body to use fat as fuel instead of carbs. 

PS: ketosis also causes bad breath...just thought yall should know."

,emile63,2010-06-19T23:27Z,"ElGato's comment demonstrates that he's never read the book. Unlike ElGato, Dr. Atkins was a real medical doctor and provided citations for all of his claims in the book. You can look them up and read them on PubMed or any other medical journal search engine. I've done just that.

In the five years since ElGato's comment was added, there have been plenty of studies that have shown that carbohydrate restriction is beneficial and not dangerous.

I've been doing Atkins for 10 months and have lost 63 pounds (29 pounds to go until my goal). I feel great, my blood pressure has lowered to normal, and my cholesterol numbers have improved greatly and become normal (LDL is down, HDH is up, triglycerides are *way* down). My doctor is really happy.

If getting rid of bread, rice, sugar, starchy vegetables, and refined foods while eating fresh meat and vegetables is dangerous, then I'll stick with dangerous. I'm never going back to eating the garbage that I was eating before. Of course, I've read the entire book and I've also done my homework so I know it's not dangerous.

ElGato, you just don't know what you are talking about."

How old are you? Should you be on this website, considering the fact that it contains pornography?

@emile63
Can you cite one such study?

People need to stop spouting pseudoscientific bullshit. It wastes bandwidth."
,sanaa17,2010-08-04T04:05Z,"There are rare conditions, however, in which metabolism of purines in the body gets disrupted. While research in this area is not conclusive, many health care practitioners suggest screening for purine metabolism problems whenever confronted with other problems, particularly in children and infants, which cannot readily be explained. These problems include anemia, failure to thrive, autism, cerebral palsy, deafness, epilepsy, susceptibility to recurrent infection, and the inability to walk or talk.

You'll notice from Table 1 that most of the purine-containing foods included within the World's Healthiest Foods - asparagus, cauliflower, chicken, kidney beans, lima beans, mushrooms, navy beans, oatmeal, peas salmon, spinach, and tuna - contain about 5-50 milligrams of purines in a 3.5 ounce serving. If you are not at risk for gout or other health problems related to purine metabolism, you would be unlikely to consume greater than the U.S. average for purine intake even if you ate more than ten 3.5 ounce servings of the above foods. If you have been placed on a low purine diet that calls for no more than 150 milligrams of dietary purines, you should still be able to consume a 3.5 ounce serving of these foods per day without exceeding the 150 milligram limit for your overall diet. 

HERE is one such study, out of many:

,akhnaten,2011-04-24T22:07Z,Thank you uploader.  230 pages of non-stop information! I heard this diet works and I'm going to give it a whirl.
,Devin.Carlos,2011-07-04T15:44Z,"OK, one thing is for sure, this thing works. Being skinny helps you to pick girls. Being a fat fuck won't you help in this. Moreover, it burns more gas while u're driving. 

First lose some fucking fat then start worrying about the proper food. "
,Pyrenaphen,2011-08-28T17:56Z,"Wow - a person actually citing a study!  I thought I was the only person to do that.  Schweet.  Anyway - imo anyone wanting to be healthy should watch the documentary ""Fat Head"".  After you get past the first 20 minutes of Sperlock-bashing, he starts to interview independent nutritionists, doctors, Ph. D's, and various other actual experts - who invariably affirm that animal fat raises HDL and lowers LDL.  The star of the doc actually does a reverse-super-size me, but doesn't eat like a fucking pig for 30 days and drinks tea instead of coke with most meals.  It was a great viewing experience, and I've recommended it to many. Check it out!  (wow, I sound like spam - WINNING)"
,Narcisse_26,2011-10-04T23:36Z,"@ElGato what you say is true, the thing about how dangerous could be to not eat following a balanced regime, but i dont know about all that stuff about cancer, water losses, ketones and some of carbohydrates, i thinks its not correct, im almost sure ketones are produced in the abscence of glucose i.e carbohydrates, because the fat catabolism i.e burning fat to get energy cannot supply the only source of energy the brain has, thats glucose, unlike the rest of the body that can catabolize fat to get energy, so they develop an alternate source those are ketons, so when you do not eat carbohydrates you produce ketones to feed the brain, they are circulating in the blood that why they appear in urine when you are in ketoacidosis, in diabetes the same thing happen because the glucose cannot be transferred to the inside of the cell because of the lack of insuline and the reduction in the number of receptors that  regulate these processes, i think the main problem with diabetes is the excess of carbohydrates, not the lack of carbohydrates... i agree with the fact that is really risky to be in this diet, but cancer and diabetes are a consequence of what you said, the might be associated, im not sure, i dont think so, but they might, anyways, everything else about proteins was really cool, didnt know that, peace."
,ihavesmellyballs,2012-08-31T20:57Z,The diet works and is not harmfull. The first 2 weeks you stay under 20 carbs a day then after that it increases.
