You can view the screen on the remote PC, control its keyboard and mouse, transfer files in both directions, initiate chat, audio chat, record sessions, and much more. The NetOp family offers high performance and great stability, yet consumes a minimum of system resources. And it's quick to install and easy to use.

On October 13, 2004 Microsoft released an urgent security update for Windows named KB840987. The Windows 2000 variant of that security update unfortunately has the side effect of requiring an update to the NetOp drivers in order for keyboard and mouse handling features in NetOp to remain fully functional. If the Microsoft update is installed without a corresponding update to NetOp, NetOp will be forced to use a less reliable fallback algorithm, which may result in some or all of the following symptoms:
• When using NetOp to lock the keyboard, the user can bypass the lock by pressing "Ctrl+Alt+Delete" and then "Escape".
• Some advanced keyboard sequences, typically used with accented letters, Asian or Middle Eastern languages might not be received correctly.
• Some programs do not accept remote mouse clicks or keystrokes in any case.
This build includes the updated drivers needed. Previously, a standalone fix for the same issue was released, so users may already have protected their computers.
