For those who can't find any s/n's to the Windows XP Pro Corporate (build 2600) file - here's a small crack that makes up dozens of serials (they makes it also possible for installation of Service Pack 1). If you want to install SP2 ...... well, haven't had much luck with those serials, but I can't recommend SP2 anyway - it's a lot of crap. Made my pc crash Big Time.
