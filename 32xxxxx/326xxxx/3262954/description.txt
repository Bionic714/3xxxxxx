Releasemagazine.net review:

This is a compilation of different Nordic artists within the electronic pop genre. Some might call it futurepop, some might not. I call some of it good music, at the very least, with the favourite being Daybehavior's “Close Your Eyes (Aktivated mix)”. Crisp production, excellent chorus and danceable like hell. Hint to DJ's: play it in clubs. 
Most tracks here drift toward the dancefloor, so the tempo is high throughout. Other top tracks include “Synchronized Hearts (Elektrokardiogramm Mix)” by Colony 5, the fantastic and aptly titled “Favourite Song (Remix)” by Sweep, and “Hezitate” by Swedish newcomers Michigan.

I think this is an interesting selection of tracks, from both oldies and fresh acts. It shows that we are still very able to make good electronic music here up north.
