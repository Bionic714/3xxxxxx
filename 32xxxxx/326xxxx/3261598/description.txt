Northern Exposure is a series about a young Jewish doctor from New York City who is obligated to practice in Alaska. Dr. Joel Fleischman was promised a comfortable position in a large hospital in the state's largest city, but he was too trusting. When Joel arrives in Alaska, he learns that he has been assigned to run a one-doctor clinic in Cicely, a tiny logging village filled with odd inhabitants and even stranger happenings.
