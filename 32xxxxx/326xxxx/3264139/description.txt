OK here's the English Dogs i filmed back in 96, this is when they were touring All The Worlds A Rage album which is there best album in my opinion. It a great show and the throw in a few old ones too, its filmed in my usual high standard, enjoy!

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
