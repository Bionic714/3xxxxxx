Mojo! is a stimulating 3D puzzle compendium that will test both the gamer's brain and reflexes. The user controls a highly energised sphere through 100 challenging stages of dazzling special effects. The object of the game is to try and complete the game's 100 puzzles, without running out of 'Mojo', the game's energy source. Players will collect all the magic coloured cubes in each level to build their 'Mojo'.

One of the most funniest game that I've every played! And even more fun in two player cooperative mode!
