Picking up where Painkiller left off, Battle Out of Hell continues the story
  with our hero, Daniel Garner, surrounded by hordes of Hell's spawns and
  demons. The blood bath and carnage continues. Lucifer has been defeated, but
  Eve (Daniels comrade in arms) lays unconscious at his feet, and Alastor,
  once beaten but not destroyed, has assumed Lucifers reign of Hell, and is
  thirsty for blood!
