       Max has lived a mundane life as a cab driver for twelve years.
       The faces have come and gone from his rear-view mirror: people
       and places he's long since forgotten--until tonight. Vincent
       is a contract killer. When an off-shore narco-trafficking
       cartel learns that they're about to be indicted by a federal
       grand jury, they mount an operation to identify and kill the
       key witness, and the last stage is tonight. It is on this very
       night that Vincent has arrived--and five bodies are supposed
       to fall. Circumstances cause Vincent to hijack Max' taxicab,
       and Max becomes collateral--an expendable person who's in the
       wrong place at the wrong time. Through the night, Vincent
       forces Max to drive him to each assigned destination. And as
       the L.A.P.D. and F.B.I. race to intercept them, Max and
       Vincent's survival become dependent on each other, in ways
       neither would have imagined.
