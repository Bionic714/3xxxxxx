,maxthecat,2008-05-12T18:23Z,"

It seems to me, considering the problems you're having show up on many different DVD rips created by lots of unrelated people who are probably not using the same software, that the trouble is more than likely on your end. Think about it man. What are the odds of, say, 10 different people ripping 10 different DVDs with 3 or 4 different ripping programs, and all 10 of them ending up with the same errors? Of course it's possible, but is it probable??

Juist throwing it out there for you to think about."
