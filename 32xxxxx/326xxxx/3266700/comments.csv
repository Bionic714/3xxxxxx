,lolita_pop,2004-12-20T18:50Z,Grymt bra film. :)
,Phorward,2004-12-20T21:05Z,"To Atmosfear:
Yep, it's the portugese audio.
It's 124 min long and I don't think the quality of a 2CD version would be better unless you compare them frame by frame. Take a look at it and post a comment here to tell me what you think."

,spawned,2005-04-18T17:56Z,"English sub files for city of gods can be located on:
http://subtitles.images.o2.cz/37/Mc
Download the required sub file. (both 2 disk & single disk files are here)
Extract to folder where the film is located. 
Play the film & click on the green icon that appears in the system tray. 
Open the sub file & apply.
The film will now play english subs"

[V],lord_terabyte,2007-07-20T11:21Z,"This one has hard coded English subs.

,gva71,2007-09-02T23:14Z,"And better image quality also - a bit of a shame those subs are hard coded, for those of us who would prefer another language. "
