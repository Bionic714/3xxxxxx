Very obscure, very bizarre comedy work (wacky kids puppet show kinda stuff, but more adult-oriented). Heard Flossie on the local college radio station and fell in love. If you have any other Flossie albums, please share. They are very hard to come by (esp. on CD.) I'll be re-seeding this every Wednesday (midnight, PST/PDT). If there are no seeds available, leave your client up or bring it up on Wednesdays.
