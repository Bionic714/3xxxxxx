,team_homicide,2007-09-30T16:47Z,I downloaded the file's but what do I do with the BIN file and CUE file? Thanks.
,prying eyes,2007-10-24T23:30Z,"@ alex-tommy: No serial is required. Its as simple as that...

@team_homicide: You need to mount it using alcohol 120% or deamon tools or using anyprogram that can mount images (nero etc). OR you need to write this disk image to a cd using nero or alcohol or whatever cd/image writing program u got.  And the files are IMAGE files."
,ags8sf,2008-01-13T23:33Z,Can I use Magic ISO to get this to work?

,arrbook,2008-10-16T17:18Z,"this software sucks , torrent is great though . 
I advice you to download typing master pro instead . Its much more straight forward .

,lorax_the,2008-12-14T08:14Z,does this work on 98 old comp
,rocketero,2009-06-18T09:52Z,"I saw the link for typing master pro and that software is only 2.3 Megabytes, how a program that size can be any good at all. I will download this Mavis beacon v.16 because I need Spanish typing, I saw the v.17 and 20 platinum also here at thepiratebay but I don't think they are multilingual for the size of the file."
,Faradaycage,2009-11-22T13:44Z,"What is a bin file?
What is a cue file?
To load a program  you usually need a an executable file. or an installer.!

I know what Zip file is a rar file an iso file.

A bin file goodness knows. Is this my challange for the day, I hope not.
Anyone got any ideas please"
,Faradaycage,2009-11-22T13:48Z,"As for Bin file looks like i need to mount it as per iso file.

I not sure why any one would use this type of file"
,khellix,2009-12-02T06:15Z,"Hey Farad..a lot of program torrents are best in bin/cue files...they are usually for apps that require ur comp to read from a disc at certain intervals... Just mount the files, and it stumps your computer..."
