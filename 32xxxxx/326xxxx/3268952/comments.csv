,miniquin,2004-12-25T22:51Z,Why the hell you delete other language subtitles?
,marrow,2004-12-25T22:52Z,"hey dont complain ,, you dont like it get over it"
,maraux,2004-12-26T01:21Z,Perhaps it's not necessary since it's a swedish torrentsite? -just a guess...... ;)
,krutan,2004-12-26T01:31Z,"swedish site, swedish sub...deal with it"
,Holkeri,2004-12-26T09:25Z,"Well, aint that just really stupid!!! Where does it say that this site is ONLY for swedish ppl? Go to school KIDS!"
,Aqueritas,2004-12-26T10:15Z,"Maybe the user Nalli didn't create this copy of the perfect storm to publish and distribute it on tpb.org just for personal use only, I uploaded ""The Ninth gate"" for quite some time ago - a copy that was only created for personal use only, and therefore the lack of subtitles in other languages than Swedish, sure it's sad when you find your favorite film with the wrong sub - been there done that... But life goes on, some day you will find ""The perfect storm"" with subtitles to your satisfaction. Maybe not on piratebay, maybe not on the horrible DC, Kazaa or whatever, maybe not on the net or in a ftp at all, the ideal place for this ""perfect"" ""perfect storm"" is at your local video- store, since the film has a few years on itself it is pretty cheap - wont cost you much at all, so why not buy it?
