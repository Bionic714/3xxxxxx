,Lomechuse,2004-12-31T02:18Z,"French always dub movies, it is really rare that VO is used.

We are not used as you are to read subtitles cos all movies on TV in France are always dubbed. No VO, so we are used to this system and because we are a bunch of conservators, we dont want to change it.

Except taht, we, French, have some qualities though :D


Sorry for you Swedish (i guess it is swedish) guys :("
