,freakindawg,2008-06-20T10:10Z,"I'm a journalistic photographer too and I found this as an affirmation of what photographers are supposed to be. I wanted to be a war photographer at first, but now seeing this doc, I realise how not everyone has the mettle to endure the environment.

photodude: I don't think *.srt files would work on this particular format. Best bet is to watch with someone who speaks german. If you find the original DVD, you can go here http://subtitles.images.o2.cz/22718/War+Photographer.html"
