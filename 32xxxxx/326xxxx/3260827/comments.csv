No problem to play it in PowerDVD (version 5), it flickers a little at timecode 1:05:48 (at the end of the guitar crashing scene). While waiting for the last seed you can do the following:
Go to the download folder, rightclick the file and drag it, release the mousebutton and choose Copy Here. Then rename the new file to .mpg and play it in Powerdvd. 

Maybe i post back with a method to convert it to Xvid or DVD, looks like its only the audio messing up for conversion at the said timecode, the videoframes are ok, just gives a second of macroblocking.  "
