On a german forum someone released a tool called starfuck. This tool allows to run starforce mini-images without disabling your cd or dvd-drives in the bios or removing the cables from them. This tool is 100% legal, because it doesnt modify any starforce file in any way. From what I have understood it disables your cd or dvd-drives in the device-manager automaticly and hides your disabled cd or dvd-drives from being detected by starforce by simply issueing some commands through windows (it probably puts them in stand-by mode).
