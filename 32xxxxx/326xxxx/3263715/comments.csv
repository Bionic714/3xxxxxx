,yallabong,2005-03-09T18:26Z,"The subs are ""soft subs"", i.e. in a separate file (the .srt one). You somehow have to get your media player to show them. I use Media Player Classic with DirectVobSub, a ""plug-in"" for showing subtitle files. Google those programs or look for a guide for how to view subtitles with your xvid/divx movies. I think there should be a guide somewhere on the Bay, or Piratbyran.org, if you read Scandinavian... ;)"
