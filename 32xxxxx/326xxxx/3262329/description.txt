          |  Get a better NIC or router, or use 10mbit!              |
          | Loading slow and not many X's?                           |
          |  Lower the maxspeed setting in the s3-gcsim.dat file!    |
          | Want to manually set a network speed?                    |
          |  Press Z at the gc sim main menu!                        |
          |                                                          |
          | Why doesn't your NIC or router work?                     |
          |  It all falls back on the NGC EXI bus - The hardware     |
          |  which the BBA is connected. The EXI bus has a max       |
          |  bandwidth of 27mbit. Shoving 100mbit into a bus that    |
          |  only handles 27mbit does not work.                      |
          |  GC Sim attempts to limit the bandwidth using timers.    |
          |  With a good NIC or router, the hardware obeys GC Sim    |
          |  and it's timer. A bad NIC or router will send packets   |
          |  when it wants to; not when GC Sim wants. The result     |
          |  is many missed packets, which show up as X's on the     |
          |  console.                                                |
          |  The problem is YOUR HARDWARE! Not GC Sim.               |
          |                                                          |

          | There are known issues with some games. They just won't  |
          | work. Homebrew rips are especially likely to fail.       |
          |                                                          |
          | Special "thanks" to iONSAVE of gc-compat! If he only     |
