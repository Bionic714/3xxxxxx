,niklask,2004-12-25T16:02Z,I didn't expect classics like this here - great!!! :-)
,magicadehex,2004-12-26T00:55Z,excellent release!!! five stars!! I hope ppl will seed this because it will take a while to get the 11 gb...
,Beat,2004-12-26T14:03Z,"About the file size: What do you expect from a 5 hour film? Large hard disks are cheap nowadays. If you can't afford buying one,  just download the three files separately (which is possible using e.g. G3 Torrent, http://g3torrent.sourceforge.net/).
As usual, don't forget to stay on the torrent until you have uploaded at least as much as you downloaded. I'll stick around for as long as necessary, i.e. I won't upload anything else until I get substantial help seeding this film."

,Vladimir23,2007-11-21T22:47Z,Can someone pls re-seed this - eager to find this 11gb version.... thx a lot!
,kyberias,2008-01-20T20:30Z,"Beat, the fact that this torrent is 11GB makes it hard for people to seed it since it might take a considerable space from their harddisc. So don't be wondering why that does not happen. :) Instead of reseeding, please convert to xvid or something more manageable. Thanks."
,Phuda,2008-09-11T13:37Z,anybody to seed :(
