This is the excellent Eureka release of Fritz Lang's epic masterpiece about the criminal mastermind Dr. Mabuse. Link: http://207.136.67.23/film/DVDReview2/dr-mabuse-gambler.htm
The runtime is 280 minutes. Rather than downsampling the high-quality video, I have split the film into three ready-to-burn DVD-R disc images.
Disc layout: part 1, acts 1-3 on disc 1 (3090M); part 1, acts 4-6 and part 2, act 1 on disc 2 (4314 M); part 2, acts 2-6 on disc 3 (4271M).
Sound: DD2.0 (a great instrumental soundtrack, recorded in 2001). Subtitles: german, english, french.
