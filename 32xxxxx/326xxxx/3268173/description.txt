There is a short circuit on the Tulip, which sparks an old section of the ship to life. Colonel Bramwell, who was in cryogenics for 50 years, is awakened and believes the Tulip is still his ship and that they are still at war with the Raiders. With the help of Bramwell and Elektra (a Raider women they are transporting to prison), Dante plans to attend a Raider gathering under disguise.
