The Tastan civilization succumbed to extinction many years ago; their only
legacy being the mysterious Tastan Caverns. Some believe the caverns hold an
invaluable treasure, while others say great wealth is attained through the
knowledge and technology left behind by this advanced race.
Take on the role of Beni and search for the truth as you enter the Caverns
on a dangerous quest for riches.
As you begin your strange and perilous journey, a female sentinel, a
holographic image with advanced A.I., positioned there by the ancient
Tastans to guard their sacred caverns, awakens.She appears throughout your
quest with a sometimes benign purpose, but other times with calculated
intentions. You will soon realize that behind the mask of illusions, the
sentinel is much more than she appears to be - her dark purpose will
threaten your very existence.
