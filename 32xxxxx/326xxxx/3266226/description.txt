    In this highly anticipated sequel to Metroid Prime, become the bounty
    hunter behind the visor once more and travel to a planet torn into 
    light and darkness. Hunted by a mysterious entity and a warring race 
    called the Ing, Samus Aran must explore the light and dark worlds of
    this doomed planet to discover secrets and augment her suit's weapons
    and abilities.

    And now, for the first time in the history of the celebrated Metroid 
    franchise, up to four players can battle each other as they search 
    for weapons, grapple across ceilings, and turn into Morph Balls to
    make their escapes.
