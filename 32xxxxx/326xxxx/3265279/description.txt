  ±    Mr. Incredible is a superhero; or he used to be, until a surge of 
       lawsuits against superheroes submitted by the people they've saved 
       forced the government to hide them in witness protection programs so 
       they could lead normal, anonymous lives. Now known exclusively by 
       his secret identity, Bob Parr, he lives with his wife Helen, 
       formerly Elastigirl, and their three children Violet, Dash, and Jack 
       Jack. He works as an insurance claims specialist, and he's fed up 
       with his pushy boss and his immoral profession, but his wife's 
       worked too hard to build a normal life for her family to abide his 
       nostalia for heroism. When Mr. Incredible's offered the chance to 
       play the role of hero again by a mysterious informant, he jumps at 
       the opportunity, but when it turns out to be a trap set by an old 
       nemesis he had a hand in corrupting, the whole family must reveal 
       themselves to save Mr. Incredible and countless innocents.           ±
