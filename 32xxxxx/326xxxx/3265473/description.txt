Thecoreofthe game is going to be the new multi-discipline career
challenge-inwhichyou'll start out in the lower leagues of club
rallying,learn your craft in over 20 different classes of rally events
includingChallenges,Cups,SuperCups,Shieldsand Championships.
With300stagesofcompetition,and a huge variety of car classes
including2-Wheel Drive,super2WD, 4-Wheel-Drive, 4WD Classics and
more,it'll be the most complete rally experience ever offered. As well
astheCareerchallenge,you'll be able to jump staight into a 4WD
championship,takeonasingle rally or individual stage, and then
take on the world in online rallies with up to 8 players.

The all-new stages feature interactive scenery,so if you push too hard
and hit a tree(or when, to be more accurate),you'll see it shudder
from the impact and drop leaves from the branches.Collisions will also
result in a dazed effect, where your vision will be blurred for a very
short period from impact. On the subject of vision, bonnet cam is back
forallthosewholike to gaze down on a pristine engine cover (if
thingsaregoingwell),or the painstakingly detailed under-bonnet
engine models (if they aren't).

The acclaimed Colin McRae Rally damage engine has been updated so even
light touches can scratch the paintwork-and as usual,panelsand
components can be deformed and removed in a realistic manner,showing
the mechanical components of the car in extreme detail.
