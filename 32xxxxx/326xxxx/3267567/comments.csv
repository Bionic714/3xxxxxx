,PirateCam,2005-02-07T19:42Z,Kan någon seeda season 3 på babylon 5 ? Många som inte kommer nån vart. Gäller även disc 6 på season1. Tack.
,Cornflower,2005-05-18T08:37Z,Instämmer helhjärtat!
,frenchie`,2005-06-15T01:03Z,Need to be seed
,caldaean,2005-06-15T20:56Z,"Yup, got to agree with the crowd. A seeder would be really nice, since everyone can finish season 3 real soon if that happens."
,Qyngali,2005-06-20T01:48Z,"Got this queued up from another place, but the only guy who has it uploads at 2k/sec... going to take a while. Just a couple rars to go for s3d6 now so will start sharing parts of this soon. But would be nice if somebody could help speed up the process... if you know what I mean. Q."
,Vargo,2005-06-20T02:00Z,Seeda!!!
,Qyngali,2005-06-20T05:06Z,"Got a faster source now, so I will probably start sharing the missing rars tomorrow. One by one... Looks like it wont take that long after all. :)  Q."
,Qyngali,2005-06-25T00:19Z,"Another quick status update. The sources I had for the missing rars is temporarily offline, so we're stuck at 63% for the time being. As I said earlier, I will seed this. It's just a matter of time... Q."
,caldaean,2005-06-25T11:09Z,"Good.. currently I got 62.7 %, but as soon as there is a bigger seed, I will help make availability better. . Hell, my box is online 24/7 anyways, so why not make B5-people glad? :-)"
,DeCr,2005-06-26T16:23Z,Still waiting for the missing 36.7% ...
,Draven_worhees,2005-06-28T16:38Z,"Hi, is there any news, is B5 seasons 4 and 5 coming any time soon?  -D-"
,Qyngali,2005-07-02T23:36Z,"Feel free to help seed this, if I have to get all the missing pieces by myslef it'll take weeks."
,Qyngali,2005-07-03T16:34Z,"Right now both sources I got is offline. The only ""place"" I've been able to locate this is on DC, but it's a lot of work jumping from hub to hub. If you find any of the rars, make sure that you set all files to do not download in your BT client, if you don't you'll need to download some pieces all over again. This is only temporary of course, as when you get all the missing rars it'll correct itself. If anybody locates 1 or more please state which one so we can minimize the problem. TIA"
,Sepiroth,2005-07-09T10:48Z,"Is there noone that can seed on this one, am stuck at 63,3 % for weeks now :("
,Qyngali,2005-07-12T15:27Z,Might be a good idea to ditch this one and grab Vaarts release instead. I know I am going to.
