Overview:
BUDDHA'S PALM (1982) is a wild kung fu fantasy filled with elaborate special effects that deals with clan rivalries among extravagantly costumed groups with names like Dark Moon Clan, Ten Thousand Swords and Heavenly Fragrance Cult. It's filled with superheroic characters, including one named Flaming Cloud Devil, who've mastered various degrees of the Buddha's Palm technique, which gives them the power to emit energy blasts from their palms to ward off such super-powerful opponents as Foot Monster, whose foot grows huge and extends out from his body by several dozen yards in order to kick or stomp an adversary.
