The installation was all good, but when I try starting the game, nothing happends except that my CPU is working at 100% and a ""monkey.exe"" is jumping around in the ctrl+alt+del thing. If i try to stop it, it says that it couldn't complete the task or something."
,kzolee02,2006-04-28T07:18Z,"I tried to install this game, but when I would have to select components to install, there was nothing to select, so when I clicked on Next button, a MSWord window opened with the Readme file and can't get any further. Is there a solution for this?"

,zak64,2009-06-23T11:17Z,"I've mounted the images in the CD2 dir which seems to work fine to begin with. But during file copy from the second cd I get stuck at 98%.

Setup seemed to freeze completely so I opened task manager and found something like ""Monkey setup: question"" there. Switching to that process I was asked to re-insert cd1, which I did. Then the install was able to finish.

I hope this helps any of you who are having problems installing the game."
