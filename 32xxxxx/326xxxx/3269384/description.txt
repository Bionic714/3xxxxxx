Description from <URL>http://users.skynet.be/mangaguide/au1767.html</URL> :

Subtitled Hachi no Wakusei 蜂の惑星 [Planet of the Bee]. (Shirow has a keen interest in bees and wasps.) Not a manga, but a complete illustrated specification for an imaginary universe, listing personalities, politics, races, technology, locations, and much more. An interesting experiment, described by Shirow as "e-conte". Shirow fans in the West will enjoy the few pictures that are there, although they make no sense at all without following the highly dense, jargony, kanji-dependent text. Not enough installments have been published to make up a tankoubon.

This was serialized in the publication, <b>Dragon Magazine</b>:
