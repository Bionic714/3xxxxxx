Tack för denna."
,kzi-,2004-12-15T14:49Z,sweet! retail rip. tackar man!
,DOTED,2005-01-18T14:35Z,"Man tackar för bra info om filmen, är alltid lika uppskattat. Laddade hem 2046 förut men då var det ingen subtitle med så den tog jag bort. 
Fortsätt så här..."
,yellowpolka,2005-01-22T12:58Z,Ingen annan som har strul med sina subs? När jag laddat ner denna är subs-filen korrupt.. och går inte att packa upp.
,BertVI,2005-04-07T02:27Z,"This is a TERRIBLE rip! Considering this is a scene release.

1 - A 'real' retail DVD rip would not contain dust specs.
2 - Aspect ratio is wrong. It should be around 2.35, not 2.50.
3 - Stuttering image during slow camera pans.
4 - Uses GMC, and cannot be used on standalone player.

The first two things I can live with, the last two not.
I had better rented it and ripped it myself, instead of wasting precious bandwidth. Which is what I will do if I can find it somewhere."
,djsantos,2005-08-06T14:26Z,"video and audio works, but no subtitles. I don't understand this asian language and I don't get english or swedish subtitles with my VLC-Player. All the xvid-codex are installed... what do I do wrong? I need _working_ english subtitles here."
,djsantos,2005-08-06T14:27Z,only asian language and no english subtitles.. this sucks!! 
,djsantos,2005-08-06T17:19Z,this XVID has 640x256
,Pappafrank,2005-08-17T00:46Z,"You can find english subs from

Thanks, Admin.
Don't pay attention to the high-priority douche-bags who think they're so great."
