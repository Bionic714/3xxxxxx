Great new-wavey comedy (good music to boot!) If you have any B&B albums I don't have (they're all out of print, I have Loozanteen, Spazchow, and Voobaha) please share them. I'll be re-seeding this every Wednesday (midnight, PST/PDT). If there are no seeds available, leave your client up or bring it up on Wednesdays.
