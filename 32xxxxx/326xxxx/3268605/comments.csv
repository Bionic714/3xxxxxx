Any interest in more Slayer DVD? I got ""War at the Warfield"" to share and also Sepultura - Chaos if that is wanted"

,matteo.666,2005-01-03T14:57Z,when i finish with download how i should burn DVD? there are a lot of files that i don't know...
,Ignobis,2005-02-09T00:24Z,"Hi. I'm almost finishing downloading Slayer.Still.Reigning.2004.NTSC.DVDR-scn33b. But I don't know how to run it on my PC. Do I need some specific software to watch it on my PC or does it works only in a DVD Player? I have a DVD ROM but it just plays, don't record DVDs. Please, help me!"
,Mamapoc,2006-01-04T17:44Z,"Can somebody seed, please? Only 8 MB remain."
,Mamapoc,2006-01-04T18:11Z,"Ignobis:
You have to extract the rar files, and will get either an image file, in this case you have to burn it onto a dvd disc or will get the video_ts directory. This folder contains the dvd-video files which can be played with dvd player software, e.g. Nero Showtime or WinDVD."
,slayamuthafuka,2007-11-17T21:01Z,"Had a quick look, quality looks fine, a complete mess of rar files however. I have just noticed 2 smaller versions of this album, maybe worth a shot  for those with slower speeds. I will seed this until 2 or 3 times share ratio, depending on how long you guys take to leech. Thanks mambi for the up, it will be placed amongst my most prices possessions. "
,slayamuthafuka,2007-11-17T21:05Z,"Just had a better look, nice quality. Had an audio sinc problem but stopped it and started it again, problem solved, not sure what that was about. Recommended download for slayer or non slayer fans, non slayer fans need to harden the F*%# up. No bugs, good download. Thanks again mambi you legend"
