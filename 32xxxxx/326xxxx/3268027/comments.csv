PLEASE!!!"
,Kay27,2006-04-13T07:07Z,Is there a piece of the movie missing or is it me?
,abuAmar,2006-04-15T17:24Z,"could someone explain how to get this thing to work.  i have tried everything i can think of, which is quite a lot and nothing seems to work.  "
,wingsabre,2006-05-06T05:25Z,"yeah, could someone explain how to combine the file?"
,wingsabre,2007-01-07T10:55Z,"the files end in .001 and etc.  it actually took me a while to figure this out.  You have to assume that it's the same as .r01 and you extract the files the same way.  For example use WinRar, and extract the files that way."
,wongfuckinperson,2007-08-27T09:08Z,"i still need help extracting this, it wont work for me i right lcik and i dont see the extract here"
,tomzy87,2007-12-06T05:16Z,"ok, to expand this, open the .001 with winrar or winzip and it should compile the movie on it's own, to be honnest i am a mac os x user so i can't be sure of it...
for mac os x users just open .001 file with Stuffit Expander and it will compile on it's own..it might look that it crashed but it takes a while !
good luck !"
,yuval_mass,2009-03-24T23:50Z,"If anyone still wants to know, i use windows, all u have to do is open this in winrar and extract it. It will become a movie file all by itself.."
,gimponwheals,2010-03-06T05:13Z,"Thanks for the upload! My DVD somehow bit the dust. 
For those having trouble extracting the file, I did too. I ended up using 7-zip since WinRAR wasn't doing it (maybe I have an old version).

,housepro,2010-03-08T11:46Z,"thanks GIMPONWHEELS, that solution worked for me!"
,Durres,2011-10-15T12:20Z,"Filed ending with .001 .002 etc are files that are split using hjsplit. You can use the same software to split and join the files. The program is freeware and multiplatform, dl it here: http://www.hjsplit.org/"
,flowdj00,2012-04-04T22:44Z,"this movie can't extract I try compile with hjsplit
