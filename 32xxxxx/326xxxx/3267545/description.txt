Big Black - Songs About Fucking, 1987 @192 kb/s

[post hardcore / american underground / indie rock / noise rock]


Steve Albini's mangled screaming is at its most bileful, his and Santiago Durango's guitars don't meander,
and the rhythm section of Dave Riley and Roland is more taut than prior. Ugly characters line up in the songs
like early arrivals at a monster truck rally. Most significantly, there's the murderer in 'Fish Fry.' Who else
but Steve Albini could paint the picture of a man hosing out his truck after chucking a dead body from it
into a nearby pond? His use of the first person can be misleading, but it's a necessary perspective for effect.
Big Black left with more of a kling klang than a bang, bowing out with a reverent cover of Kraftwerk's 'The Model.'

To sum up: yowl, ching, thump-thump-screech.
