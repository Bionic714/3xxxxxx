[T],Peterq,2005-01-04T07:28Z,"Can someone PLEASE tell me how to get this release to run! every time I try to start the game it gives me a ""protection error"" dialogue in the taskbar, restarts my system and then I'm told ""the system has recovered from a serious error"" I've removed the image from my ""downloads"" folder until it's sorted. No point in sharing something that doesn't work and wasting other peoples bandwidth!!"
[T],Peterq,2005-01-04T08:08Z,"Further to my comment above, I've finally found a working fix courtesy of ""Spacebot"" and posted as a comment re another version of the same file. I repeat it here:

Download this software :

And go to on ""DirectShow filters"" and ""nero video decoder"" and click on unregister
and the game will never crash anymore ! 

Thanks to Spacebot!
Peter"
,tu-borg,2005-01-05T00:40Z,"Sorry, Peter! Didnät help me: No Nero video decoder in the list. Do you know of any other filters that need to be unregistered?

Darn... I havenät been able to really enjoy Colin since the first game! Always something weird (mostly my logitech wheel - doesn't work well with 2, 3 and 4 - or rather too well - *full* force feedback, all the time.)"
,tu-borg,2005-01-05T22:52Z,"YES! I did it!
I -killed- the DSFilters folder in Zoom Player, that did the trick! (There's a ""nero"" video filter there too)
...but I'm not very impressed by the game so far. Doesn't really seem worth all the hysterical effort! :-)"
,Tyreline,2005-02-11T12:26Z,What is this??  error:Could not found GraphicsSS_SetupRender Adapter

,chemicalw,2005-03-18T20:42Z,"Here is how it goes:
1) Edit your Colin McRae Rally 2005 Windows shortcut (found on the desktop and/or the start menu) by right clicking on it and selecting properties.
2) In the target box, add NOVIDEO after the target entry, so the target looks like this

""C:Program FilesCodemastersColin McRae Rally 2005CMR5.exe"" NOVIDEO

3) Click on OK or Apply and now try running the game again""
