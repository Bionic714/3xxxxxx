This new version will take Reason from the studio realm to the stage. Reason 3 comes packed with unique features that will make it a strong alternative to the hardware workstation synthesizer, whether for composing, producing or live playing. 

This is fully functional but be aware of that it is a BETA release. The 20 minute restriction is gone when you apply the patch that is included.

Torrentupdate: Sorry but the patch will not take care of the "not able to save or export anything"-restriction. :-( I hope there will be some crack out soon cause I really like the new mastering equipments in this version of Reason.
