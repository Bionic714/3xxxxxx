re: Danny Boy ,the national anthem (adopted) for up north,Ulster,the 6 or some say the 9,
well there is an ave in there if you read the words,lol."
,Rilriia,2011-03-17T01:59Z,"lol@ Odoinn does it say who did these versions? A lot of these have been done... but to Kasperebba.... uhm to point out some things...

The Newfie Stomp is Newfoundland. (Hence Newfie.)

Snoopy vs The Red Baron, while done by the Royal Guardsman, is American. Snoopy being a comic strip character from (American) Charles M. Schulz's (RIP) imagination of Snoopy in a dogfight with one of WWI's most fearsome figures 'The Red Baron' Manfred von Richthofen.

*cough* Scotland The Brave.... seriously guy? No offense, but really?

Stan Rogers (another American) wrote Barrett's Privateers. 

But....seriously.... Scotland the Brave?

Great collection though. I'm hoping the artist names are included as I'm trying to find some artist info on some song renditions... but I have to ask this, Scotland??? REALLY?"
,locofrog69,2012-06-01T22:32Z,Stan Rogers was Canadian not American and is about Halifax Nova Scotia
