,Crimacabre,2010-05-10T17:42Z,"Seems like the best torrent for this album, all the other Stop making sense torrents have studio versions of some songs instead of all live, this torrent is the only torrent i've found in which all the songs are live versions. The songs are in WMA, a little bit annoying and the quality isn't extremely good. But if you are gonna download the Stop making sense album then this is the torrent you should download. Great album."
