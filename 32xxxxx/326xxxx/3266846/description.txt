            Unzip, unrar and install the application.
            During installation enter any email address, as serial
            number use: 6666666666 or anything else that == 10
            chars.
            When installation is finished start Ghost Console, go
            to Help > Register Console and use provided keymaker
            to generate your Validation Key for the chosen License
            Quantity. If you won't enter any serial during
            installation (since it is optional) or if you'll get
            'Unable to apply the validation key. There are no
            outstanding registration requests' message when you
            try to register, you need to go to Help > Generate
            Registration File, enter email and sn (anything 10
            chars) and then after registration file is created, go
            to Register Console and use the keymaker.

            Enjoy.
