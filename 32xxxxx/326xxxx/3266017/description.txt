For 13 years, the Soviet Union conducted systematic examinations of UFO sightings within its borders. At the same time, the official government position was that such phenomena did not exist. And experts in the U.S. long felt that Soviet officials used reports of UFO activity to cover up military secrets and activities.

Drawing on commentary from some of the world's leading UFO analysts and formerly top-secret documents uncovered by journalist George Knapp, SOVIET UFO SECRETS REVEALED illuminates one of the most mysterious chapters in the history of UFO investigation. From the famed Siberian explosion in 1908 to a 1982 event at an intercontinental ballistic missile base, the complete stories of many sightings are finally presented here, with the various theories for the phenomenon presented, analyzed and debated.

Despite the wealth of new information presented here, many Russian UFO enthusiasts believe that more important findings have yet to come to light.
