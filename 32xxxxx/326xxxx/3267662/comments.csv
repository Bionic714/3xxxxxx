,Kappa143,2005-02-27T16:20Z,"Is this the prequel to My Sassy Girl? I have heard that it is.

N책gon som vet?"
,piepants,2005-03-09T23:35Z,How do I view the .sub file?  What viewer are you using?  I tried opening it using subtitle workshop and it told me the file was unsupported/bad
,granQ,2005-07-02T18:13Z,"its has nothing to do with My sassy girl..except they are very close in ""story""..tough girl loose boyfriend, find a new..

but they not the same story or something.."
,ichimaru,2005-07-13T04:20Z,"they are directly related. aint it the same chick and at the end the same guy?
its the story of the bf who died in ""my sassy girl"" if u know wat i mean
but yeah watch ""my sassy girl"" first then this."
,Myopoeic,2005-08-06T08:08Z,"Thx for the upload, much appreciated. This is not an official prequel to MSG, and the insinuation at the end (by introducing the guy from MSG) is widely regarded as this movies biggest flaw, since a convergence would require some changes in the script, one of the more obvious being that in Windstruck the female lead is a police officer - in MSG a student...
On another note, if you enjoyed this movie you might wanna check out ""...ing"" and ""Il Mare"" (Siworae). Il Mare also stars Jun (the girl from Windstruck and MSG), and is scheduled for an american remake next year with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock."

,sveva22,2008-04-08T01:30Z,"Yeah,
the subtitles error every time I try to watch the movie. Any suggestions? Can I dl new subtitles without trying to get the movie again? Thanks."
,instinct_X,2008-06-30T04:41Z,"For those having trouble with subtitles:

I have uploaded a copy of subtitles in .srt format to OpenSubtitles. Download the file from there and put it in the same folder as the movie file. Here's the link. 

http://www.opensubtitles.com/en/subtitles/3300039/nae-yeojachingureul-sogae-habnida-en"
,jehurey,2009-04-21T00:14Z,"I didn't have any problem viewing the subtitles. i didn't download the subtitle instinct_X offered. I just extracted the sub file from the rar file.

For those who didn't know, .sub & .idx work together. If the subtitles didn't show up and you chose to ""Open a Subtitle File"" from the player, choose the .idx subtitle file NOT .sub.

If you guys don't get it, just download a new one."
,khimenix32,2011-04-05T13:54Z,seed please i need this badly
,AegeanC,2011-09-25T02:35Z,"Myopoeic, I totally agree with ""...ing"" and thank you for the info about ""Il mare"" ... I didn't know that!!!"
