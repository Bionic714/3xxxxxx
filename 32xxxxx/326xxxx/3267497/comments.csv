,vandank,2004-12-21T19:46Z,"Great! How about vol. 1? Someone got that one? Would be great. Anyways, thanks very much for this torrent."
,Noffes,2004-12-22T00:09Z,"vandank if you read the whole desciption it said at the end:

You can find disc 1 here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3267046"
,xyzzy,2004-12-22T08:40Z,"I guess ""vandank"" is refering to:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005KARD/102-7837914-5352151?v=glance

With cartoons from 1935 - 1938. Not disc 1 of Volume II.

It would be great if someone could upload that one too.

Anyway, thanks for this one. "
,vandank,2004-12-22T20:16Z,"Thanks xyzzy, for explaining for Noffes what I mean. Because he can't read, he just throws out stupid comments about how I can't read. Volume 1, and not Disc 1, is what I mean, just as  I wrote."
,xpern,2004-12-22T20:51Z,"I have Mickey Mouse in Living Color Volume 1 in NTSC too, but you have to wait a week or two or three before I can help you out. Uploading at a reasonable speed takes all my bandwidth, and I would like to get some stuff for myself first.  :) 

Volume 1 exist in PAL countries also, but I do not own that version.  

Be good now and upload at least as much as you download and I might share some more cartoons. 

A Merry Christmas to you all! (Just a few more days of frantic christmas shopping..)  "
,vandank,2004-12-23T15:46Z,"Thanks, Xpern. That would be awsome! NTSC works just as well as the PAL version for me. Thnks very much, and Merry Chrstmas!"

,unchained_anger,2008-09-13T00:48Z,"PLEASE, PLEASE SEED"
