The following items have been fixed or improved:

     

     * Fix for the nVidia 66.93 drivers. The game no longer crashes when a race

       is started. The game has also been tested up to the 67.03 drivers

       with no problems found.

       

     * Engine fire burns aligned to the car's coordinates, e.g. when the car is

       upside down, flames go down.

       

     * Tuning menu: BHP meter and colors randomly switch when changing profile.

     

     * Flip back and forth to statistics screen and the BHP grows bug.

     

     * Force feedback slows game in some cases.

     

     * 5.1 sound support is not working on some setups.

     

     * Disconnects when returning to the lobby in multiplayer games.

     

     * When the game briefly minimizes before starting a multiplayer game,

       sometimes gives a blue screen (this is quite rare,

       but it does happen sometimes)

        

     * Only 2 players can play if NetLimiter is installed.

     

     * Bug with public ip detection, if the commandline 

       network options are used.

     

     * Enabled a switch to allow the player to turn off ragdoll in single

       player (located in the Options Menu).

       

     * Enabled multiplayer destruction derby.
