Within this awe-inspiring, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS world, a fighting saga begins. Control a party of three - a fighter, a sorcerer and a rogue - in a quest to right a wrong and shape the future. Switch characters on the fly to exploit each warrior's specialized fighting styles (projectile/ranged, melee and sneak combat) and maximize each character's attributes. The right moves will build the party into a well-balanced fighting trio. The Demon Stone gameplay elements - diverse, exciting and extremely cinematic - push action/adventure to an entirely new level!
