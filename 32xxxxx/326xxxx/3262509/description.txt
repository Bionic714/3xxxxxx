3 CD-Girls in .mov

I suggest using Media Player Classic with Real Alternative and Quicktime Alternative. This is a stripped-down mediaplayer that has all the codec's needed, the Realplayer and Quicktime included, and absolutely none of the spyware-crap that Realplayer installes. This player is also very good for playing damaged files.

Comments are allways appreciated
