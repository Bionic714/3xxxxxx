.wv can be converted to ALAC (Apple Lossless) for use in iTunes and iPod/iPhone, with the app called ""SoundConverter"" from the Apple AppStore."
,TheDanishLlama,2011-09-13T23:36Z,"I'm sorry if I made it look like I had finished downloading (hence all seeders disappered).
I had just downloaded one of the albums. I am not done with the rest. Thanks in advance for seeding a little while longer :)"
