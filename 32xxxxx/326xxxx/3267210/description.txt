This movie gave me nightmares for days! Talk about scary. The story takes place mostly in an abandoned Insane asylum. Now that in itself is a messed up. Wouldn't want to go anywhere near that place. The plot is a little confusing, but the atmosphere is amazing.

En amerikansk "oamerikansk" skräckis! Jättebra!!

SEED AS LEAST AS  MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!!!!

"If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE!" 
[thanks to cor for that]
