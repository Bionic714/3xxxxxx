Seedar så klart när jag fått ner denna."
,roru,2005-01-15T11:12Z,"varför är spelet på 3 gig?

när man packat upp cd1 å cd 2,så är de bara på ca: 1,5 gig...verkar som om du la in 2 onödiga filer på 1,5 gig som ej behövdes"
,Gazza01,2005-05-24T19:35Z,"good news!

I've just figured out a way to upload the completed dev-pop1.bin and dev-pop2.bin files from the other torrent.  That means that those of you who were stuck on 96.1% completion, can now receive the remaining pieces for the .bin files, which will complete when you reach 98.4% like what mine says.  For those of you who are just started downloading, don't bother downloading the .rar files!

Enjoy your now completed .bin files!

PS. pass this message on!
PSS. Yeah, as you might have guessed, I did have to download the other torrent wasting 1.5gig, but at least I could help you guys who have been stuck on 96.1%

Enjoy!, hey only this torrent has the .cue files and the DEViANCE crack!"

,meismekore,2007-07-21T08:26Z,how do i seed ill do it
,Protonpack,2007-08-14T17:25Z,"I just realized something that will help anyone waiting for a seed. The reason the download is so big is because the .bin and .cue files are in there twice. You download them uncompressed and then again in .rar files. The thing is, you don't need the .rar files. My download has stopped at 99.3% and been there for a while, but I just ignored the .rar files that the download is trying to finish and installed the game using the .bin and .cue files. I'm over halfway through the game and it's working perfectly."
,Protonpack,2007-08-14T17:26Z,And I just realized someone already said that. Damn.
,eldanny,2008-02-05T20:46Z,me quede en 99% que paso ya no lo estan corpantiendo?
,kenth_619,2008-08-29T23:44Z,"Man I spent 2 days downloaded this copy of POP and the damned data.rar files on the CD were corrupt. I ran the install and the install crashes (cyclic redundancy test). Please explain EgonDahl. Please explain. Until then people I cannot recommend this download. Get another torrent.

Torrent Grade: F"
