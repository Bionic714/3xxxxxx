Awesome progrock album produced by one man in Texas with some very operatic singing and playing. Not to be confused by the death metal band by the same name. Hard to find, out of print album. I'll be re-seeding this every Tuesday (midnight, PST/PDT). If there are no seeds available, leave your client up or bring it up on Tuesdays.
