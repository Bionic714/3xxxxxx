Cosplay is the Japanese abbreviation of costume play, for those of you who don't know =)

Including uncensored schoolgirls, a hotel maid, a waitress (in a cute orange uniform) and a girl in kimono. ALSO featuring the Famous "Helicopterman". He's with the girl in the kimono, you'll soon find out how he got that name, haha. Enjoy!
