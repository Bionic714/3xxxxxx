VIVA LA BAM

Is all about the antics of pro-skater, Bam Margera. His wacky ideas and sometimes &quot;helpful&quot; friends ultimately make the show what it is : 22 minutes of complete catastrophe and sometimes emotional torture! From turning the house into a skate park to planning scavenger hunts, he keeps the show a family affair.
