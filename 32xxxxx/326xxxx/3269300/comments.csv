,JBQ23,2007-08-22T17:22Z,"Holy crap, downloaded really fast! 14 seeds to 5 leechers is a beautiful ratio! 
Great rip, audio fine, if anything the video is a teeny bit dark but you can play around with your VLC settings to easily remedy that. Thankyou for ripping this for us Dave! I have wanted to see this for a really long time! :D"

,gitsune,2010-03-27T12:03Z,"Please do, jack."
,LowkeyNine,2010-10-20T13:48Z,I have the DVD and it is awful. The dark colors and fuzziness of this version actually makes the show look a LOT better! It looks more authentic... I'm downloading this version again! :)
