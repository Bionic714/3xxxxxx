,chrazy,2004-12-17T11:57Z,Sure thing.... Dear.
,Teaflax,2004-12-22T10:40Z,"Comedy Central's ranking was way off on so many comics, though. Though you may differ in exact rankings, it's just absurd that Eddie Izzard ended up 75th while Richard Lewis was in the top 20. Come on!

1. Richard Pryor
2. George Carlin
3. Lenny Bruce
4. Woody Allen
5. Chris Rock
6. Steve Martin
7. Rodney Dangerfield
8. Bill Cosby
9. Roseanne Barr
10. Eddie Murphy

The top four - absolutely. Now, Chris Rock has gotten *really* good in the last few years, but good enough to be in the top five? Naw. And Roseanne? Even if you want a token female in there, Poundstone, DeGeneres and even Judy Tenuta are much better.

Sorry - just had to rant."
,chrazy,2004-12-24T06:56Z,I Miss Pablo Fransisco from the list... 
,cybernet1c,2007-01-09T09:30Z,Bill Cosby should be higher on the list... he's better then people give him credit for; and as far as I'm concerned George Carlin should be No. 1.
,cknlads,2008-03-14T15:12Z,I only got 99.9 and then wouldnt get anymore...dont download
,QuestionEverything,2008-06-23T15:49Z,Truly a great human being! Funny as all hell! He transcended comedy and spoke out on a number of issues. He shall be remembered as a true patriot. Rest in Peace George! I'll seed till I bleed for you!
,kyletissue,2012-02-24T18:20Z,"Still enjoying watching it, but I'm missing that one final piece. Stuck at 99.9%! Who's seeding this?"
,laari,2012-08-18T03:56Z,"chrazy, I do hope you are alive. Come back to seed , please."
