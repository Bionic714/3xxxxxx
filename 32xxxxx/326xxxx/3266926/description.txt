	STORY:
		In the year 2015, the Angels, huge, tremendously powerful,
		alien war machines, appear in Tokyo for the second time.
		The only hope for Mankind's survival lies in the Evangelion,	
		a humanoidi fighting machine developed by NERV,
		a special United Nations agency. Capable of withstanding anything
		the Angels can dish out, the Evangelion's one drawback lies in the
		limited number of people ablel to pilot them. Only a handful of
                teenagers, all born fourteen years ago, nine months after the
                Angels first appeared, are able to interface with the Evangelion.
                One such tenager is Shinji Ikari, whose father heads the NERV 
                team that developed and maintains the Evangelion.
		Thrust into a maelstormi of battle and events that he does not
                understand, Shinji is forced to plumb the idepths of his own 
                inner resources for the courage and strength to not lonly fight,
                but to survive, or risk losing everything. The extraordinarily
                popular television series that took Japan by storm, NEON GENESIS
                EVANGELION is the latest project of Gainax, creators of 
		Gunbuster, and Nadia, Secret of Blue Water.
