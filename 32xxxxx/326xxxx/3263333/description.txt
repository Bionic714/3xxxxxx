     As Major John "Dutch" Cane, you will be leading an elite platoon of 
     mercenary commandos. Officially, these guys don't even exist.

     enemy before they have a chance to zero in on the station's control 
     center and threaten colonized space. You must secure the station by 
     eliminating the alien threat, or life as you know it will cease to 
     exist.
