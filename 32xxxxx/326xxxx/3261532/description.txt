
Hilarious and engaging as usual, this release from Rollins is a one-hour story of his adventures with a slightly off-kilter pilot and adventures in the Midwest of America. Like all of his other spoken word releases, it is honest and funny. Definitely for fans of the man's work; it will also entertain anyone who likes a little subversive humor (and doesn't mind profanity).
