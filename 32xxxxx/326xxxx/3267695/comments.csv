,pimpncritic,2008-10-21T00:04Z,I need seeders in the worst way.  I know there are only 4 of you but help a game player out.  
,cembaum,2009-10-20T12:38Z,"hi, thanks, great, downloaded beautifully, but : keep getting popup about keyboard which interrupt game (Plaktoetsen), any way to get rid of this ???

lol
chiara"
,tbraybrook,2011-10-20T21:38Z,"Thanks. Downloaded fast and worked. Only tried Cue Ball Wizard so far but that worked fine. Anyone know if there is anywhere in this to change it to 5 balls instead of 3? Looked in Controls and didn't see that option.

@cembaum, I didn't have any keyboard problems yet but if it happens later I will post about it. You may need to disable Advanced Text Services I think it is if you have XP.
