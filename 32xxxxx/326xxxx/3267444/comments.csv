,meatball,2004-12-22T07:41Z,Must be ripped since Encore only is an almost full DVD
,Memnock,2005-06-21T16:30Z,"Great release, this is very handy!"
,mercureyx,2005-08-06T23:55Z,This thing is working for you guys?  Is it the 'fixed' version do you know?  
,saytensays,2006-06-20T01:27Z,"yes, ripped versions of some apps, only way it would fit onto a dvd.
the 'fix' for this release is just to remove a few MBs from the ISO so that its small enough to fit on both a CD-R and a CD+R.
to remove the extra MBs, you should find this release:
""All.Adobe.DVD.Optional.Fix-XiSO""
which is only a few MBs itself."
