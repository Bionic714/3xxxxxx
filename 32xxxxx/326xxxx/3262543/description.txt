OK here are the Bombshell Rocks that i filmed back in 1999. This is a great show with the Bombshell Rocks full of energy. If you don't know the Bombshell Rocks you are really missing out on some amazing punk rock, they are the best band to come out of Sweden since Passage 4. I would recommend the album From Here And On(2002) as a good place to start. There early stuff is similar to early Rancid and they just got better. Filming is at my usual high standard, enjoy!
