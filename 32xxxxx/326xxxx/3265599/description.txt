Audiophile's greatest release yet.

The Blackalbum re-released as a Audio DVD with crytal clear 5.1 Surround Sound. Availble in both DD and DTS, Metallica has never sounded this good.
To be enjoyed in a good 5.1 hometheater system. 

This is not an attempt to bug Metallica but since they haven't released such an album. 

Enjoy!
