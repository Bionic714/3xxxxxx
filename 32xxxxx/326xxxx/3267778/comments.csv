,Kilpp,2007-06-13T22:34Z,"Never mind that former. Are there any ways of getting this working without first having to burn the damn thing on a CD? In other words, can it be played without the CD and if so, how?"

,Nikoza,2008-06-03T21:05Z,Okey.. this is weird.. virus searching program (Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware) completed searching and didn't find anything.. then it just started to install Settlers 4 Trojans and the elixir of power (i had CD in).
