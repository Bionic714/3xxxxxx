,birdienumnum,2005-07-17T01:08Z,"if you stop this torrent, why not close the whole site?
Anyway about this torrent,
- can anybody prove me that buying this DVD will help Africa?
- can anybody  show me how the Live Aid project from 1985 has made improvement to the people in Africa?
- can anybody explain me why Africa and not any other ""poor"" places on earth?
- can anybody explain who in Africa will benefit the Live Aid project, which countries, people, governments etc?
- can anybody prove me that 100% of the paid amount for this DVD will go to the people in Africa and not to any administration cost nor any other paid worker and their taxes etc?

Live Aid might be a good idea but I do not have the time to confirm that this in fact is true."
,Tridec,2005-07-25T02:24Z,"birdienumnum, you are a fucking illiterate retard!!! 
Ofcourse the money goes to Africa, Live Aid is a trusted organisation! 
Why Africa?, because Africa is in more trouble then any other continent! troubles such as aids, poverty and hunger!
So the next time you want to act stupid in public think about shutting your fucking mouth, It might make you look smart! "
,baretta1,2005-07-26T23:25Z,"Hej!

,smellyhippy,2006-01-30T13:44Z,"I agree with keeping it real. Live aid was a great idea, about helping real people in real poverty. If you think the shops that sell this CD or the companies that make them are not making a profit from your money, DREAM ON ! Download this torrent, seed it, enjoy it, and give your money straight to Live aid or some other charity."
,Shaffyre,2006-03-20T12:19Z,"I donate a big chunk of my relatively good income to various charities including Unicef, Amnesty Intl, the PRAY Foundation and others. All who help the poor of the world. If I bought the Live Aid DVD's part of my money will go to the store, another part to the wholesaler, another to the DVD manufacturer, another to the distributers, another to the record companies and in the end there's little left for the poor. In general only about 5 to 6% of the price of a CD goes to the artist/s. For DVD's it's even less as a part also goes to the filming company. If u want to make a difference then donate money to 1 or more charities that help the poor in the world or go and help the people in Africa like I did. Well, I actually did both. Posting here urging people not to download the DVD's but to go buy it won't make one bit of a difference to the poor people of the world. Peace be with u and may God bless u!

Oh, I almost forgot! Thank u very much psychopink for seeding the DVD's!"
,mrchrstn,2008-04-16T02:49Z,"To those of you making a distinction about which items it's morally correct to steal and which items it is *not* morally correct to steal...please keep your politics to yourselves.

It's not like you're going to convince anyone anyway, or they wouldn't be here.  Like you.  Like me.  Steal if you must, but don't get all pretentious to me about how you do it more ethically than I do."
,darknessv,2011-05-09T00:13Z,"no dont stop seeding,do want this"
