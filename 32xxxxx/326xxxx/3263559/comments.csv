,wasteddownfall,2010-05-14T07:44Z,You definately need a mounting tool such as UltraISO or you can burn the .img file to a cd then you can play it on your console... you can also try to convert the files into .iso so you can play it on your psp... ^_^ great upload tnx... i'll seed it as soon as i finished downloading...
