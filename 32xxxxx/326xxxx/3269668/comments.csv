By the way, do you know anything about converting FLAC files to iPods? 

Have a nice day ;)"

,downloader12345,2007-07-21T08:18Z,Been stuck at 95% for a month or so now... some more seeding would be great
,Apt_Quadruped,2008-03-18T21:17Z,"Thanks douchebag, I'm sorry I wasn't one of those that got the luck to download all of the torrent and not be stuck at 95.4%. I'd appreciate if you got over yourself and at least fixed the 95.4% to 100%. I'm one of the proud people at thepiratebay that actually seed to a ratio of 1.5+. I'd love to understand how I can blame myself for not being able to get all of the torrent though, other than not building a time machiene to go back to when you weren't a douchebag."
,axelhm,2008-09-16T21:05Z,Some seeding would help... Plx?
