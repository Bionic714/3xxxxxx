I recently decided to stop seeding this and all other albums due to the fact that Piratebay users simply don't seed or care about ratios at all. I will make another try in maybe a month from now at best with a new album. I'm sorry, but the only one you can blame is probably yourself.





UPDATE: THIS IS THE ONLY RECORD IN THIS CATHEGORY I WILL SEED UNTIL I SEE YOU LEECHERS AT LEAST SHARE A RATIO OF 1:1. REMEMBER IT'S YOUR FAULT!!!!!

System of a Down - Self titled.

Now finally in an acceptable format, since mp3s wreck your HiFi equipment here we go in FLAC format
http://flac.sf.net

MP3's belong to the 90's, use FLAC and be happy...

If you like FLACs and want me to put up more (Got about 300 records in FLAC) please message me or put in the comment section of this torrent. If interest is low I'll simply stop seeding. Expect that I will seed 1 New FLAC record every day. Also please note that you SHOULD if you're able to, rip your own records and follow the FLAC standard of storning things

That is 
<Artist name> - <Song nr> - <Song title>.flac

Description:
At the request of someone I am reseeding this one.  System of a Down's self titled
album.  Nice touch of metal, but with actual discernable lyrics.  I shouldn't really have
to say much and my brain isn't currently working well enough to think of much. :)
Sorry for the C2 being on, but I assure you this drive doesn't screw up with it on, 
I've had it for years and this CD has since met with certain death.

AMG Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine

System of a Down's self-titled major-label debut finds the Los Angeles band consolidating
its gothic alt-metal, sharpening its deadly riffs, strengthening its brutal rhythms, and
adding muscle to its attack. The band differentiates itself from the legions of Southern
Californian alt-metalheads by emphasizing its Armenian musical heritage, which gives the
music an eerie, otherworldly quality. Part of the success of System of a Down lies with
producer Rick Rubin, who helps give the band focus, but ultimately the record works
because of the band itself, since they have contributed a set of strong songs that
illustrates this is a band that relies on smarts as well as sound.
