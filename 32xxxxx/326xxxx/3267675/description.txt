''Cheap Thrills, the major-label debut of Janis Joplin, was one of the most eagerly anticipated, and one of the most successful, albums of 1968.
Nobody had ever heard singing as emotional, as desperate, as determined, as loud as Joplin's, and Cheap Thrills was her greatest moment.
Heard today, Cheap Thrills is a musical time capsule and remains a showcase for one of rock's most distinctive singers.''
