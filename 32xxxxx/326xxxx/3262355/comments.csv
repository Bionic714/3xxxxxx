So my question is: Is this movie dubbed or is it in the original language?"
,trashstar,2004-12-07T03:08Z,"from their homepage: ""Idioma:  - Español"". too bad... would've been a nice download otherwise

*shrugs and remebers 4 downloaded 24-eps, dubbed in spanish. 1.4GB bandwidth straight down the drain...*"
,trashstar,2004-12-07T03:10Z,"tyvärr har de INTE dubbat ""Linkin Park & Jay Z - Collision Course"". då kunde den kanske blivit lite intressant?

*blundar o försöker tänka sig 8 mile dubbad på tyska*"
