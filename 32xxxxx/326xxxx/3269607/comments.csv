,Ripa-,2005-01-14T18:13Z,"you must use Daemon Tools:
1. get daemon tools and istall it
2. run daemon tools
3. take emulation and safedisc
4. Virtual CD/-DVD-Rom and mount image
5. take cue file and install it
6. take crack and overvrite old files
7. thats all"
,LOH,2005-02-06T12:16Z,"CD-Key is a game's/program's personal registration number. It's also used (sometimes) when you want to play online. You'll find it in the ""Crack PCTorrent.com""-folder in the file ""leeme.txt"" on the CD #1 and it also says in spanish that this game doesn't need a crack, it accepts the CDdisk as an original. However there is Bloodhound.W32.EP virus according to ""Norton"" in the keygen.exe-file, but I haven't noticed any damage since there is no need to use that file, however I will reburn the CD1 without that file, just in case. I have used the Alcohol 120% (downloaded through this eminent service) to burn both CD:s and there was no problem whatsoever, it works like an original.

REGARDS!"

,Marlene,2005-07-02T16:07Z,"Hei.

Jeg er litt noob når det kommer til nedlastninger og innstaleringer osv. Når jeg har fått lastet ned dette spillet, må jeg da gjøre en masse fiks/fakserier for å få det til å virke? Isåfall, hva?

Håper noen gidder å svare!

mvh Marlene."

,jcb2271,2005-08-10T20:42Z,Well Pussy Devil I may have found it..... Don't use the shortcut.. Go to the list of programs within the Pirates program (Start / All Programs/ Firaxis Games etc) and you should see Start Pirates in safe mode. I have the got the program to run OK so far..No problems. Hope this helps..Good Luck
,jcb2271,2005-08-10T22:23Z,"Sorry forgot to say... Once I started in Safe mode and started a game I quit right out, then used the shortcut and it works. Looks like you need to use safe mode for the first time only... Good Luck"

,kablam.of.the.clan,2007-05-26T21:15Z,"Works perfect! Thanx great torrent!

Just follow theese steps and u are bound to get this right:

1st mount daemon tools on Disc 1 

2nd Instal the game as normally (the cd-key is in the crackPCTorrent-folder in the textfile Leeme (use winrar to open disc 1 and extract crackPCTorrent))

3rd When the game wants the 2nd disc, mount daemon tools on it (u only need one virtual drive)

4th When the game is installed open crackPCTorrent (see above) and mount the file ""Pirates!"" on the original in the gamefolder (C/program files/Firaxis Games...)

Now u can play the game without any cd"

Remember your uploade rate is proportional to your download rate.
If your not uploading or uploading with less speed you will not get good download speeds...."

,ThePirate1011,2010-12-16T02:16Z,"Legit Torrent. Great game, but can get old after a while. I find that Age of Pirates (any of them) is a more in depth game as you have more free will and more open gameplay. But a good game and legit torrent none the less."
