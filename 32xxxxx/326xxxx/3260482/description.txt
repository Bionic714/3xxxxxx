Dual DVD copy allows to make copy of the Video-DVD disc on DVD-R/RW, DVD+R/RW or CD-R/RW media or save it as AVI file on your hard drive. For this purpose you need the DVD-RW, DVD+RW or CD-RW burning drive. 
You should not worry if you have combo drive which is used for reading and burning. Application able to perform copying using only one CD-RW/DVD-+RW/DVD-ROM device which is at first used as DVD-ROM and then as CD/DVD Burner. 
If the movie will not fit to one disc the application asks you to insert another one to burn the last part of the movie on second disc.
