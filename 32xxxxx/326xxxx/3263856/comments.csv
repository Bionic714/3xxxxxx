I didn't even realize TPB had been around this long!
This torrent was uploaded in 2004?! And it's still alive & kickin'. Hasn't even been a comment in over 6 years!
Hopefully, one day, 8, 10, 12 year old torrents won't be a big deal. But for now, this is impressive- damn near brings a tear to my manly eyeball.

Good job seeders! Way to go fellow pirates. And may all of our future endeavors stand up to the test of time.
