,datars,2005-01-04T05:24Z,And thanks Kula_kicks for sharing.
,datars,2005-01-04T18:28Z,"I just burned the DVD, and when I play it on my home DVDPlayer, the picture rolls. This was also the same problem when I had downloaded the DVD of ""Christina Aguilera - Stripped Live In The UK""

As goes for any other DVD's that I’ve downloaded they’ve work just fine.

Now I live in the US, and is it possible that the DVD must be played on a foreign DVDPlayer?
If anyone has an answer, please PM Me. 
Thanks

,datars,2005-01-04T23:57Z,"Here’s the answer to my question:
Europe uses a PAL system where the encoding is done at 25fps (frames per second)
US uses a NTSC system where encoding is done at ~30 (29.97fps).


Composite signal (RF or Phono) cannot handle the 50/60hz signaling and color correctly, only Scart / RGB will. As such try using a fully wired [21 pin all wired] cable to a TV that supports both 50hz PAL and 60hz NTSC signaling."
