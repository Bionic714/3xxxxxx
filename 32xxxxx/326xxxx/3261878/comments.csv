,Maverick,2004-12-07T01:07Z,The end is missing (or is it a double ep?)
,Marcil,2004-12-07T04:46Z,"I was thinking the same, it says runtime in nfo is 20:40.281 and the episode also stops at that time.
So probably the ending credits started right after that.

But one thing i found strange, they use to have like they have it in friends, some ""more"" of the episode before the actual ending credits come. Hope you understand what i mean. In this as you say, it just stops."
