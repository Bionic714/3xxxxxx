Plot:
Taken from imdb.com:

For many years professional assassin O has resided in an isolated world of 
killing and loneliness, which only becomes worse after the death of his love, 
Nancy. 
But his life begins to change once he meets the innocent Chin. Chin, hired to 
clean O's apartment, has never met her employer. However, soon the flamboyent 
and reckless Tok enters Chin's life with a mission--to unveil O's identity and 
usurp his place as the number one sharp-shooting assassin in the game.


                                                 
Ripp Note:

Mine got the AC3, not the DTS, DTS takes about 300% more space so it had to go.
DTS was the only thing that was ripped out.
