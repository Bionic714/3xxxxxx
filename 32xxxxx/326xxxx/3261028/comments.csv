,sedrol,2005-01-27T01:10Z,"Takker, takker, dette er jo faen meg det beste som er lagd av tv serier da!"
,Goregasm,2005-01-29T19:21Z,"Ja,er en genial serie det der.. :)"
,redmags22,2005-08-03T22:46Z,although it shows 100% there is an issue with 111 and 113 they don't play although they show as complete - I'm still seeding anyway but thought you all should know
,Kyrol,2005-08-08T09:17Z,"Anyone get 111 and 113 to work? I still haven't got this finished yet, but it is at least Downloading."
,Kyrol,2005-08-10T03:55Z,"Ok, I've checked and both 111 and 113 work fine with VLC Media Player. Both report as MPG files so they really only need a rename.

Quality isn't the greatest in the world, but it's a lot better than nothing, which is what has been available on this wonderful series until now. There is, apparantly, a DVD release coming, possibly in October. We can only hope. "
,Godflesh69,2011-07-11T05:24Z,Sweet... I swear the networks never gave this show a chance. I only saw about 8 episodes during broadcast because it came on around 11pm on a Sunday night... Only two seeders :( Bummer
