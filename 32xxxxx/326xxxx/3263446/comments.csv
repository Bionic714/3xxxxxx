,Snaizer,2005-07-09T03:34Z,"Awful release. I hope the music is fine, but it's SILLY SILLY SILLY that you expect US to do all the renaming shit. So, dudes, beware: this release has NO TAGS _nor_ ANY DESCRIPTIVE FILE NAMES. People need one of those two, dude, preferably both. Over 900 hundred people have downloaded this album. I'm sure a big fucking lot of them has done the work which were actually only supposed to be done by ONE person. Nothing more was needed, but you couldn't do it. Great. I'll stay away from www.pctorrent.com at least."
