,Elric,2005-04-15T02:44Z,"Fantastic Collection - Thanks very much. I have a small question though. The Set of Beach House 04.02 there is supposed to be only 11 tracks per CD, however there is 12 tracks with the first CD. As none of the tracks for this Album have been named but are instead called just Track 1, Track 2 etc. it is rather difficult to figure out which is the real extra track and where did it come from? I have tracked down covers till I am blue in the face and all that I have found are all listing only 11 Tracks per CD for this Album. Can anyone shed some some light on this seeming discrepancy?

Thanks again for the great collection."
