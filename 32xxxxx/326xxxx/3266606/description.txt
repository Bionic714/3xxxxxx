"Space Rangers" opens a new era in space adventure. Now you can forget about
   stages, missions, and passing the game on a piece of paper. Events in the
   game occur “for real” and are not just triggered by a date, or other event,
   following a fixed script. 

   It is a coherent and live world in which each character really exists.
   Even leaving players’ field of vision, other ships and planets continue
   their own adventures, living their own lives as long as the game lasts.

   You have the chance become one of the adventuring Rangers, and it is
   possible that it is you who will, in the end, save the Galaxy. Every
   living thing in the world is in grave danger!
