,Unsweet,2005-01-05T09:04Z,Gillar ration på 1:50 =/
,STop,2005-01-05T13:19Z,This is a great series but it would be even better if it wasn't dubbed in English.
,the_jezter,2005-02-10T06:25Z,"rather, it woulld be GREAT if it wasn't for the dub!!!
i'll keep sear..... wait a minute... ""dual audio""? doesn't that meen that it has the japanesse audio as well????
         plz advise!"
,Kolle_kolle,2005-02-18T14:12Z,"can u recommend a player to use??....dont know what player to use to play up these OGM files....im still downloading it so i haven't tried any prog yet, and how do i get japaneese audio?"
,Voultner,2005-06-23T22:57Z,use video-lan to play them all. search at google for it and ues you can change the audio with video-lan
,Voultner,2005-06-24T20:14Z,http://www.videolan.org/ you can dl it there
,darkelth,2006-04-13T10:28Z,How Can i get subtitles to it by BSplayer?
,donpedro,2006-06-08T18:41Z,"One of the best Animé TV-shows ever made!

If you feel the western theme is far fetched and the characters are difficult to grasp, just watch 3-4 episodes and you'll get it.

Character and plot development is one of this show's strongest features."
,RagingSka,2007-06-02T23:32Z,Hmm... it says there are seeders but I can't connect...
,TOPRAMEn4,2007-06-18T22:15Z,"i'd say that the best player i've been using is media player classic. with omg files, while your playin the file, you can right click on the screen and go to audio and change it to what you want or subs if available."
,TOPRAMEn4,2007-06-18T22:17Z,"http://www.cccp-project.net/

you get the video player in the pack."
,Meltdownpyro,2007-10-14T21:20Z,"VLC media player, no question its awesome"
,DasTuefel,2007-10-28T22:25Z,this looks like a cool anime thnx for the upload

,stanleyman,2007-11-01T02:58Z,oh ya btw if you could seed would be verrythxfull i heart trigun
,WanderLink,2007-11-06T22:26Z,"You people who are complaining that this is the English dub are idiots. In Trigun, the dub is BETTER than the Japanese voice work. You complainers are just wapanese weirdos who need to get a life and accept that even in Japan you'd be losers. Frickin' snobs. Guess what? Disney movies are dubbed into Japanese, I doubt the Japanese cry it's not ""pure"" and demand the original English dub with Japanese subs. No, they don't, because they're sane."
,techiefIve,2007-11-09T12:03Z,"@WanderLink
Relax, people have different tastes. It's not up to you to decide what people are allowed to like. The good news is that everyone can be happy with this torrent. If you use VLC Media Player by Video-Lan, BSplayer, or Windows Media Player Classic, you can make use of the dual audio and subs. All three players are available for free (Google them), so purists can watch the Japanese with subs, and people without the mental acuity to read and watch the action simultaneously can have the English dub. 

@Dragar
Great torrent!
Video 9/10 because of some artifacts
Audio 10/10"
,kakarottgt,2007-11-30T15:35Z,"WanderLink  don't you know is better to listen a serie or a movie in the original lenguage because it was made that way no matter if it is in spanish, english or japanesse i just like to listen with the real audio not a translation so get cool and stop pointing peoplo"
,Wendo,2007-12-14T05:39Z,Thx a lot for this. And WanderLink... chill whit the caffeine ok mate?
,sprfreak14,2008-02-28T03:10Z,"Thanks, Dragar. There's nothing wrong with this torrent so far. I've already downloaded the first 5 episodes and the quality is great. Plus, I can either watch it in Japanese with English subtitles, or dubbed English if I get tired of reading.

@TOPRAMEn4
I agree. I like the CCCP, too. http://www.cccp-project.net"
,MissMuffet,2008-03-03T02:19Z,"Is anyone around that could seed this? My download time is hellishly long, right now...*sigh*"

,chaztherobot,2009-07-13T23:41Z,"Could somebody who has it complete seed? I have 99.9%, I will leave it seeding 24/7 for several weeks when I get it all, but I need that last little bit. Thanks, this is my favorite show ever!"
,Kezaia,2009-07-31T16:04Z,can some people please seed this? mine is not downloading T_T
,jasonibbs,2009-11-29T23:53Z,"For those that spoke about the original voicework versus the dub, I prefer the original cause thats what I first heard it in with english subs.  The one eglish dub I've seen this in was on cartoon network and it was heavily edited removing all nominally mature material.  So when possible I would like the original over a dub, just in case.  Thanks for the great upload either way, great show."
,Doreiku,2010-03-08T20:30Z,Nice torrent. Good job.
,belowlove,2010-10-19T15:12Z,Thank you for this! Great upload. :)
,Philonetic,2011-06-04T21:13Z,"New TRIGUN MOVIE: Badlands Rumble, I would upload instead except the shitty fucking upload section wont let me upload any torrents.  

Trigun Movie: Badlands Rumble 720p torrent here - http://www.nyaatorrents.org/?page=download&tid=183371

Trigun Movie: Badlands Rumble 1080p torrent here - http://www.nyaatorrents.org/?page=download&tid=183372

If somebody could upload them to TPB that'd be great.  Or if TPB would fix the fucking uploads or unblock me from uploading it'd be even better."
,destruct5,2011-09-01T22:44Z,"Good torrent.
