The program is made by Duja, Torlen.Net Software!
You can share the program as you want, but dont sell it dude ;)
I made it for private use, so dont blame me if it doesn't work.

The program is made in Sweden ;)
But i made it in English to make it more easy to understand for everyone!

Files needed:

COMDLG32.OCX

Good For:

Strongly recommend Azureus for this!

I use it to copy a .torrent file from my computer to a
shared location on my server!
I configure Azureus to open .torrent files every 1 minute from
the dir from were my torrents have been copied!
When a download is finsihed azureus copy the file that is finished to
another dir.

I think this is a very and good way to use a server as
an download machine + you dont need to have your computer on
over the night, just let the server do the job!

IMPORTANT!
To make the BitTorrent network stay alive!
Set your share ratio to min 1.5 in Azureus!

installation:

Just copy the files to a location were it can stay
i recommend that you create a directory in
"/Program Files" ex. "/program Files/tss"
and then start the program to config it!

Associate with .torrent!  (Recommended)
Makes the programauto. open a torrent when 
you download it!

Copy file directly when opened! (Recommended)
Makes the program copy the .torrent file directly
to the given location instead of waiting!

Delete source then Finished! (Recommended)
Just like it says, deletes the source when the
.torrent file is copied!

Save As. !
This must be the shared folder on your server
all your .torrent files will be copied there!

Browse!
Only if you have a .torrent file on the computer 
and want to copy it from there!


Greets to friends and TPB, best site 4 torrents!
