Play Starforce 3 protected games without disabling your optic drives.
Mini-image for each game neened,Daemon Tools 3.47 needed. Easy GUI. Creates a shortcut with parameters to launch the game. I have tested following games with success:

Toca Race Driver 2 (1.0,1.2update)
FIA GTR
Soldiers Heroes of WWII(1.22,1.8update)
Divine Divinity

You can apply official patches and play.
Supports Starforce 3.xxx - 3.6xxx
Removes Blacklisting of Alcohol & Daemon tools.

NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE YOUR OPTIC DRIVES IN DIFFERENT IDE CHANNEL 
THAN YOUR HARD DRIVES !!!
AlSO CHECK THAT THERE ARE NOT ANY IMAGES MOUNTED WHEN LAUNCHING THE GAME
