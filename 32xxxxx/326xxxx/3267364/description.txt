Produced by: Poor Specimen Synopsis: With a decidedly comedic approach Loose Change takes on the age old question "what would a pro surfer be doing if he didn?t surf?"

In between the surfing segments, viewers follow Rob Machado as "the slacker" traveling around his home town looking for work. On his way, he meets up with today's best surfers as their non- surfing counterparts. The acting is hilarious and the surfing is off the scale.
