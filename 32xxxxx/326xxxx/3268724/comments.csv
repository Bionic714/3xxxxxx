,caoquemordeuhomem,2009-06-30T19:29Z,"Using the emulator in this torrent I can't get any music, whereas I can get music if I use the official demo version."
,Phavonic,2010-10-02T23:42Z,"Can anyone tell a novice how to get this to work. I don't know anything about ""virtual demon"" or ""PCE.IN"" files. 

All I know is that this is the first emulator to not run simply and easily. I try to load the Rondo of Blood file in the emulator's CD drive, but nothing happens. I've done this with it zipped and unzipped but it doesn't register. 

Someone please reply with a simply solution, it'd be a waste to miss this great game."
,Rizolto,2010-11-10T03:50Z,"@Phavonic 

Simply search for a PC port of this game, its on the net and is around 25mb. However it have trouble running on win7 64bit."
,gnawingonfoot,2011-08-21T20:28Z,"Thanks so much!  The mp3 method has always been awful with emulating console games, and too often when people do upload full disc images, it's in Nero's crappy proprietary format and pretty much unusable for gnu/linux peoples.  So thank-you for this awesome upload!"
,gnawingonfoot,2011-08-21T21:06Z,"For anyone wondering what's inside the game zip, it's four files.  The game comes as CCD/IMG/SUB with a CUE sheet."
