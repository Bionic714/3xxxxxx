I like hentai games not so much for the cartoon sex (that doesn't really do anything for me unless I'm in a really odd mood) but more for the writing and dialogue interactions and these are all great.

most of the hentai games out there iclude viruses as: Trojankill.PY, Backdorr.Bifroze, and thousends of more diffrent trojan, The viruses are so effective that the game might still work even if it include viruses, IM NOT saying that this torrent includes viruses, but im telling u to be at you're watch, by scanning BEFORE  installing the game, cause the game does more damage if u install the game, then it can accses you're whole CPU,
remember SCAN before install
it's that simple!"
