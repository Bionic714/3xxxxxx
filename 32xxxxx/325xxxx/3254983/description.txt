First aired 1978.

As usual, if you like this stuff and want to see more like it, buy it (or at least an alternative, like the book version).  Your wallet helps dictate what kind of stuff will be produced. Here's a start: http://www.bbcshop.com

Note: My computer is fairly unstable at present (dies after a few hours), so have patience while getting this. If the machine goes off line, I'll reconnect it to the swarm as soon as I notice the problem. Just hang in there in the beginning until there are enough seeders out there who can take over.
I'll seed the primary and secondary phase for 7 days, after that it's up to others to make this material available.
