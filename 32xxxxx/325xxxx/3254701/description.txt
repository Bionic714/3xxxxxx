"If we meet again, let's meet as friends!" Cha Tae-hyun ("My Sassy Girlfriend"), Lee Eun-joo and Son Yae-jin ("Classic") join a circle of friends interwoven with laughter at the beginning and tears at the end in the Korean romance "Love's Concerto" (2002) directed by Lee Han.

Five years ago, Ji-hwan(Cha Tae-hyun), a young man who originally only had his heart fallen for his photography entered into a close friendship with not only one but two comely young ladies with polar characters. Soo-in (Son Yae-jin) is quiet and reserved whilst Kyung-hee (Lee Eun-joo) is energetic and cheery. Smitten immediately by his shots of Soo-in, Ji-hwan made the direct move but did not receive his desired response. Thanks to the timely use of a clock, however, Ji-hwan turned back the hands of the clock, asked the girls to forget what just happened and soon the threesome became inseparable pals. The deepening of their relationships led to the inevitable tension in their friendship and one day these two girls with their different charms just disappeared in Ji-hwan's lifeâ€¦

Love fades. So does friendship. Can photographs help preserve them? Let "Lover's Concerto'' unfold a photo album filled with the closeness and even some regrets of the lives of these three young people.
