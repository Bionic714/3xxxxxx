,sullen,2006-09-17T12:04Z,"For everyone's information
Rosetta Stone - application is needed, and not found on every torrent...why?  Each language pack is about 700mb and barely fits on a cdr (ie. spanish(latin) level I & II = 700mb or so.  The program automatically finds the language packs, so all you have to worry about is installing the app, and then making the language pack available (although I have seen a dvd with app and languages running right off the dvd...which when you mount the image directly onto the harddrive makes for an easy ""install"")

SO...Get the app & install it to harddrive, then..1) download language file & a) burn to cdr & use cd each time you want to use that language b) make the 700mb language pack that you find into iso or whatever image and mount on your computer.

Hope that helps...the ones with questions."
,pan!C,2006-11-11T23:35Z,"Okay so I downloaded and Installed the Main App; It's working fine but found no Languages. I have this ISO downloaded as well, I burned it onto a data-CD, but when I put the CD in the main app loads and it still says no Languages... wtf? Help me out :)"

I have downloaded a number of things that people have told me such as Daemon Tools, Alcohol 120, and MagicISO and have played around with mounting and things like that.  But I really cannot figure it out and am hoping someone can help out an idiot such as myself."
,ghosthunter83,2006-12-02T22:55Z,"No problem with the questions.  This is what I did and it works fine.

1.  Download this torrent.
2.  Download this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3239452

This is the main program.

3.  I use Isobuster to open the main files torrent.  Extract them to wherever.

4.  The main file torrent contains the set up files.
5.  Run setup and remember where they are installed to.
6.  Run Isobuster on the Spanish Level 1 and 2 ISO.
7.  Extract them to the root directory of the main program.  For Example, Mine is
c:/program Files/The Rosetts Stone.

enjoy.  This worked for me."

I've downloaded 1&2 and know that the app is contained in Level 3 but the links on the comment board are pointing to non-existent sites now.

,x_t_c_27,2008-07-11T22:39Z,if you downloaded the rosetta stone software via torrent it comes with a safedisk program that you need to use in order to trick your computer into thinking it a cd in the cd rom and not just a image on a virtual drive.

,morrison0880,2008-10-30T21:48Z,"Hey all. Go to 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3865583/Rosetta_Stone_Ultimate_Language_Disk_v2.iso
You get every language in an iso file. No Extracting, all you have to do is burn it to a disc with PowerISO or Alcohol and it autostarts when you load it. You can also mount it to your virtual drive. It comes with all the help files, language sheets, and even a bonus language program. Works perfectly. I got this about a year ago and I love it.
Oh, and only 3.62 GB, so it fits perfectly on a DVD, or takes up as little space on your HD as possible. Trust me, this is the easiest way to go. I tried torrents like this, and the set up and installation alone was the biggest pain in the a...With this, no installation is needed.

The file is in ISO format. You don't have to install the program to your computer. You can use PowerISO to burn it to a disc, and it will autorun on your computer anytime after you put the disc in. Or, if you don't want to burn it, simply use the ""Mount"" option in PowerISO and choose to mount image to drive [E]. It should then open up the file folder with RS in it. If it doesn't, go to ""My Computer"", right click on your new (E) drive, and click run. That's all you have to do. Rosetta Stone will run on its own, no installation needed, no extracting files, it is all self-contained. You will see every language, all you have to do is choose one and off you go."
