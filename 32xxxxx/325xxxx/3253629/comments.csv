,Arcelor,2007-03-26T06:26Z,"Welcome to 1st mission 1st pilot on duty:
Totally a great game. I never had a game like this before, totally immersing, as deep as space as the game is set on. After downloading, I used winRAR to extract the rar file on each folder CD1 and CD2 game, I used DAEMON, tuned all options on, on the emulation option. mounted the rld-nex1.cue from CD1 folder as well as from the CD2. Autorun begun, click set up. I opened the serial number generator on the crack folder. After that I copied the 2 exe files in the crack folder, then made the game run, then I suddenly felt I am on another world, hope you experience that, especially for the first time you play the game. A new game that offers a new kind of interface with a sense of realism on the graphics. Hey I love the physics of this game. Almost all in the game are something like based on engineering and physics, on how they should work, just to name a few, the revolving modules so as to move air for the inhabitants. Well I have said everything you need to know on how to make this game work for you and how exciting this game is. In return I will seed it as long as it is in my computer and I am online. thank you BeMyGuest, and for all the people who seeds and will seed this torrent file. 
Captain out..."
,sdeligar,2007-04-03T23:46Z,So where do I get the key generator needed to install the game? I didn't see one when I installed it
,sdeligar,2007-04-03T23:51Z,And yes I am seeding the game after downloading it
,phantor01,2007-04-14T05:18Z,Where can I get the manual for this game.The more I play it the more features I accidently find.A hot key list or something

,paynet,2007-07-12T03:16Z,The download and installation went perfectly but i cannot find the crack file that you are supposed to put in the directory. If anyone could help me I would be very thankful!!! :)
,JMSK82,2007-08-19T20:06Z,"Ok.

It comes in broken down rar files. Open in winrar and extract the bin/cue from each cd. Mount them in daemon and install. Once installed open CD1 to explore in PowerISO or in windows. Find the Crack folder, take the files from the crack folder and put them into the main Nexus directory.

Play this awesome awesome game."
,fallout11,2007-11-11T00:42Z,"One of the most awesome games no one bought, and one of the best sleeper titles in recent years.
Get it and play it!"
,jawmaster131,2007-12-26T21:28Z,"The cracks for this program do not work when you have AVG antivirus installed, because AVG mistakes  them for Obfustat trojans. Even if you turn off heuristic analysis in AVG, AVG will sit between you and the crack files, preventing access to them that would let you copy and paste them into the program directory.
If you're worried about them actually being trojans, know that I virus tested them with the best open-source scanner: ClamWin Antivirus. They are clean as a whistle. Switch to ClamWin, and you won't have problems, but you'll have to manually run ClamWin for system scans (not that this is a bad thing, since AVG is very annoying).
Otherwise, follow the exact directions specified above by Arcelor. They worked for me."
,Deraldean,2008-01-30T23:33Z,Hey Chouru did they ever tell u how to fix that prob im getting the same thing. any one any ideas on how to fix really want to play the game 
,Niceo,2008-02-21T03:49Z,"Hey Everyone, hey jawmaster131

About the AVG issue, does this mean that I won't be able to play Nexus as long as I have AVG installed on my computer? Even if it is ""deactivated""? Cause I did so and as I try to copy the fixed exe in the Nexus folder all I get is a message saying that it is impossible to do so, access denied, but no mention of AVG.

I did have the obfustat message first (each time I swiched windows in fact...) but turning AVG off stopped the AVG warning, not the Windows message.

ClamWin could help with that? Could Something/someone help?"
,Flanker15,2008-03-16T13:23Z,"Ok listen up you chaps who are having the datacab problem during install:
This is how I did it.
Put all the files from inside CD1 and 2's .bin into one folder and then run the setup from the hard disk."
,Flanker15,2008-03-24T12:44Z,Ohh and I got AVG to remove the NoCD files from their database so it should work with AVG now after the most recent update.
,F01D3R,2008-05-11T15:37Z,"Okay...I have readed all the comments, but still, with all your instructions, I can't find the Crack directory in CD1. I have mounted, installed with Daemon tools, everything is fine, but it has to be cracked to be played, as we all know.
Please help me out with this one!

Thanks--F01d3r"
,F01D3R,2008-05-11T18:18Z,"Oh, sorry, I realised the problem-.-'

Then, for those, who occur the same, ""wrong cd in drive"" problem:
When you have the ISO of CD1, burn it to a CD in non-ISO format.(so you get the original version)
Then go into ""Crack"" directory, and copy everything from there to the install directory.

I know-- this has been already wrote down in the instructions, but there are people, who don't understand that:)

,supergeek91,2008-06-09T12:22Z,Okay this is for you guys everyone who had trouble like me. Many said to extract the cd do that. do it  for both just one rld next 1 and 2. Okay when you finish installation mount cd one. then i want you to explore it like you would any other cd. When you explore it you should see the crack file right there. Now what you mount is the cue file ignore what anybody else said you need it.
