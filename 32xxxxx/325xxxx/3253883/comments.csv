Mvh"
,remiel,2005-02-14T15:44Z,"if you are referring to step 2 after you've installed and rebooted, you have to mount the installer image before you do anything more. don't restart the installer after you've mounted the image, and don't dismiss the installer that asks for the cd. just mount the image and then continue with the already-progressed installer (the one that's at step 2). it should pick up that the ""cd"" is there and allow you to continue the install."
