,EnvoY_Iz_ClUtcH,2010-08-18T20:29Z,"no wait, i extracted them with 7-zip"
,OneAwesomeDude,2011-07-30T17:12Z,"Works perfectly!! Thank you BeMyGuest! :D

Programs you'll need:
Alcohol 120% (to mount the image)
Utorrent (duuh :P)
WinRAR (to extract one of the folders)

1. Once the download has finished (leave it seeding!) right click and open, and then extract to your desired direction.
2. Open the folder with all the files, extract one of the zipped folders with WinRAR (notice the zipped folders are all the same copied many times)
3. Once you have unzipped one of those folders, open Alcohol 120%
4. Then go to ""Virtual drive"" on the sidebar in the left.
5. Select 1 device
6. Now that the virtual drive has been created, go to the bottom of the program (tab called ""folder view"")
7. Right click the drive that has been created (e.g. (F:) YLE 170HI..) and then click mount image.
8. Go to the folder where you unzipped one of those WinRAR file, and there should appear only one file with the format ""CUE"" (when you click mount image).
9. So since it's the only image it detected, it's the right one to mount. Right after you click mount that image, an installation wizard of Shrek 2 team action will appear, install it and ENJOY! :D
