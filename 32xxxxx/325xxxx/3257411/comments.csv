,krille70,2005-01-28T10:32Z,Denna säger att jag har fel CD. Den säger att sätta i rätt CD och det gör den hela tiden. Och det hjälper inte vad jag än gör så vill den inte starta spelet. Finns det något sätt att få igång det? Eller kan den inte köras på Windows XP Pro?

,QoMSoL,2008-03-27T15:23Z,The stupidity is impossible! Who the hell got the idea of cutting out the sound effects so the game shows an error every time a sound is played EVEN if you turn off all the sounds. It drives me nuts! >=( Please warn about things like that!
,QoMSoL,2008-03-28T08:26Z,"Disregard my last... %)

,elektromodulator,2008-08-28T20:34Z,"I have the same problem, it won't start, just sets the resolution at 640x480 then exits. win98 Compatibility mode doesn't help either. Help!"
,allthingsfake,2008-12-05T19:02Z,"Uhm guys, did anyone succed in running this app? I can't figure out how. Nerdmeister, if you're still alive, can you teach us how you made it work? Pretty please? :D"
,Nerdmeister,2008-12-11T21:12Z,"I though that I just used the app called Virtual Daemon. To be honest, it's been a long time though. Let me see what I can find out."
,Nerdmeister,2008-12-11T22:51Z,"Well, it WAS working when I first downloaded and installed it. Now, it seems to be corrupted. All I get is a black screen. I'll work on it though. May be a few days."
[T],Hgames,2009-02-27T03:02Z,"My release is working if this one is still giving issues.

,Stan_Yeu,2011-02-12T02:12Z,"You need to download the NOCD crack even when mounting from a virtual drive.

1- dl crack from www.gamecopyworld.com
2- Replace HIMECUS.EXE with cracked version
3- Masturbate til you go blind/someone walks in"
,endlesswaltz29,2011-03-09T04:13Z,"I also get the same old problem.. The installation of the game was successful, and I also downloaded the crack file from www.gamecopyworld.com and apply the exe file. But the time that I will play it, I only get a black screen and hangs up. Is there any solution for this? Thank You Very Much! :D"
,DomoFan32,2011-08-17T04:13Z,same problem for me black screen also very strange way of installing instead of an mds or mdf files you use a bwt file
,Ctuchik,2011-09-18T13:10Z,"Black screen at startup is usually a codex issue, download ""combined community codec pack"" from http://www.cccp-project.net/. If that doesn't fix it then it's generally a compatibility issue as they are to old, or a language locale issue. some VN's require japanese system language because they don't use unicode (it doesn't change the language in windows UI)."
,Calamitous_Avatar,2012-01-07T10:40Z,"You're all farther than I am. I can't even start it up. All I have are a bunch of c00 files. Daemon can't mount anything, not even the bwt. So color me confused; I'm used to ISOs."
,jinmu,2012-01-27T22:15Z,I'm having the same problem.  How do I launch this game?
,chensta,2012-03-25T13:22Z,"For those with the black screen, close chrome.  You'll thank me for it"
