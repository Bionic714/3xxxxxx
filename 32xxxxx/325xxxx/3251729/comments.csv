,johnny42,2004-11-17T21:26Z,"Has anyone been able to get this working?  If so, would someone be able to help me?"
,johnny42,2004-11-19T15:40Z,"I downloaded the files and burned them to disc and installed all 3 discs.  I can only see data files but no ""program"" on which to play this stuff.  Help me please!!  The Steinberg website shows a ""desktop"" of a large guitar with knobs and controls. How do you get that screen?"
,simon941,2004-11-19T18:41Z,"You need to load it up in Cubase or other audio software that supports VST. It takes MIDI input.
Works fine in Cubase SX, haven't had time to try it with other software yet."
,johnny42,2004-11-19T19:40Z,"Thanks for replying simon.  I thought this was going to be something else.  I don't know about midi instruments.  I thought this was going to be a collection of ""songs"" or generic ""tracks"" that I could load up and play as background to my own guitar playing.  Sort of like, it plays the rhythm while I play lead.  Oh, well.  Again, thanks."
,AxMataz,2005-02-18T17:36Z,Kan noen seede denne pleeease?

,NorwayOwns,2009-03-22T20:29Z,"1. Extract cd 1. to for example my documents
2. Go to my documents and go to cd 1. When u see all the RAR files u select all. Right click and press exract here.
3. When thats done u see a new file has shown up. Thats the file u shall mount.
4. After mounting that the installing would show up.
5. Install and do the same thing to CD 2 and 3.

Hope that helps. If your using Fl studio or Cubase or wathever u dont need to drag the .dll file to vst image line. It will show up automatic when u lanch for example fl studio."
,Robasko,2009-06-01T22:07Z,"Jag har installerat det och mitt FL verkar hitta det men jag får inge ljud och de syns inte att den laddat fram nå ljud eller sample, Måste man spela detta med ett midi-instrument eller? ^^

I have installed this plugin to my FL studio and it seems to find the plugin but i cant get any sound out of it and it doesnt seem like it has loaded a sound or a sample, do you require a midi-instrument to play the sounds with this plugin
Thanks! :)"

then copy files from discs back to hardrive ?"
,antong20,2010-02-28T12:31Z,"Great torrent! Works without problems for me on Windows 7 64-bit. Here is what I did:
1. I extracted the zip-file for CD1.
2. I extracted the rar-file I got then (there will be a lot of files, just extract the one that ends with "".rar"").
3. I mounted the bin-file that was inside the rar.
4. I started the installation.
5. When it asked me to switch CD I just did step 1-3 with the next CD, and clicked OK.
6. The installation finished.
7. Virtual Guitarist still didn't show up in Cubase 5, so I had to add the installation folder in Devices/Plug-in Information/VST 2.x Plug-in Paths.
8. Now it works perfectly! :D"
,bobshaw,2010-03-14T19:03Z,"How to install using Ultra ISO on WINXP...
1. Unrar the RAR files into their respective folders (CD1, CD2, CD3) and you will have bin and cue files for each CD.
2. Locate the stvg1-tnc.bin file in CD1, right click on it and select from the list of progs, UltraISo/Mount to Drive F: (F: in my case) or whatever the virtal drive is on your comp.
3. Go to that drive (F: for my case) in My Computer and run the installer from that virtual drive.  It will start up and install correctly, then ask for CD2.
4. Do exactly the same thing (mount the bin file from CD2 to your virtual drive) when it asks you for CD2, and CD3, do the same.  Just mount the other bin files to the virtual drive and then go back to the installer and click okay to continue the install.

It works perfectly in Samplitude, my DAW.  No problems with the install, it works perfectly."

,odiethewuff,2010-04-30T23:36Z,"Here's how to fix the ""Please Reinstall"" Error:


Go to the folder where you keep your VST's. There should be a folder associated with Virtual Guitar. Open up the document entitled ""Path"".

Chances are, the address that leads to the folder where the soundbanks are is wrong.

Change the destination to whereever you installed the sounds.

Tada...everything should work fine now."
