,TheExile,2005-08-09T06:40Z,Fuck all of you who are trying to download this record.  Do this guy a favor and go out and buy it.  $14 bucks depending on the suburb you live in you rich douchebags.  Murs wrote a song for you punks who think you know his struggle --> And This is For.  Haha I bet you assholes already have it downloaded what am I talking about.  
,timmyr,2006-01-15T23:26Z,does a full version of this actually exist out there? its been on here for over a year...i can only get 55.8% of it.

,carl-johan,2006-06-24T23:15Z,"anyone got the new murs album, murray's revenge?"
,Solarsun,2008-04-21T23:50Z,"I'm not going to direct this at anyone because you know who you are, but this is a quote from MURS himself:
""...don't feel bad if you downloaded the album. I really don't give a fuck. Hopefully you can take something away from what I said and find something to laugh about. That'd be great."""
,FiftyKilowatts,2008-05-21T21:26Z,"Firstly, Exile, you're obviously a hypocrite. Nobody surfs on PirateBay just to make comments urging people to buy what they're downloading. You're obviously pirating shit and ripping other people off just like the rest of us.

Secondly, piracy is not damaging to less known groups like Murs. Quite the contrary, piracy serves as mass marketing for them, whether they wish to engage in it or not. This huge campaign by the RIAA is motivated by and benefits large production companies and well established groups - not smaller ones. It sounds paradoxical, but, in a way, limiting piracy legally is limiting competition.

Finally, until just recently in human history, musicians didn't have the ability to record and distribute their work for profit. They relied solely on income from live performances ... for thousands of years. If past artists survived  in such a manner, I find myself hard-pressed to be morally conflicted over being part of the 10% of people who pirate a form of media that didn't exist a few hundred years ago."
