,haxz0r,2008-12-20T08:55Z,"hey i downloaded and installed it fine BUT i get an error when starting the game ""wrong cd inserted"" im kinda new at this so this is probally an easy thing to fix so can anyone explain how to fix this or stop the error occurring. thanks :D"
,haxz0r,2008-12-20T23:43Z,"dont worry guys!!! i fixed the problem. heres how to fix the problem/ install to the game the right way:
1.download torrent
2.mount kott1 file to virtual drive (preferably deamon tools or magic disc/ISO) and install first part.
3. when it says ""insert disk 2"" unmount knott1 from the drive and ON THE SAME DRIVE mount kott2 file.
4. do the same for kott3
5.  unmount kott3 and put kott1 file back on the same drive.
6.install the patch
7.if you try to run the game now it wont work so go to this site ...and download the top link (1.0) and go into wherever folder u installed knights into and delete the main .exe file (templar.exe).
8. put the file you downloaded (knights of the temple.exe) off that site into the knights of the temple folder.
9.play the game
10.enjoy! ;D"
,regenerats,2009-11-12T21:05Z,"Played DEMO at friends place today, game is great... but it's hard to get use to the keyboard controls, especially when moving in combat and at least they made aiming bow with mouse, that's good. In overall I give 8/10 to this game. "
,Inaija,2010-01-30T12:08Z,May I just ask.. To what site? There is no link! I don't get this thing to work..
,cannabis1,2011-01-21T14:42Z,Seed please! Thanx in advance!
