Use Daemon tool (cue file)."

Also for those that need instructions, just download poweriso from here (my version of daemon tools gives me troubles), and mount/unmount cds (the .bin files) 1-5 (and it will ask for 1 again) on the same drive, then mount/install cd 6 (tales of the sword coast)."

,SGT_artillary,2010-06-14T11:05Z,"AWESOME torrent, Downloaded this on june 13th 2010. Just to give a heads-up to people new to torrents. Mount the zip file or rar file do not winzip or unzip this download. Run it straight from daemon tools or whatever virtual cd drive you are using. After installing the baldurs gate 2 original then mount the zip file for the expansion. Keep in mind for BOTH installs choose the FULL install option so that you wont get promted to insert cd's throughout your game. These are old games and back in this day not many people had nice computers if at all having one, so they broke down the installs so that your computer would only install the minium data onto your hard disk drive (HDD) and run the rest off the cd's which made the game playable on most any computer instead of just the top of the line back then. there is another awesome torrent download for BG2 + exp here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3927084/Baldurs_Gate_2___Expansion__amp__Patches# I really have to give a huge thanks to you torrent masters.

I had a similar problem that you have, but with a different code. I went to this site http://forums.pocketplane.net/index.php?PHPSESSID=002e4f06b1458d42544fe85003944ce6&topic=305.msg2939#msg2939 where I found mine. I am not sure whether yours is there, but maybe you can get an idea there? Good luck. 

Ps. Like the site also says, the assertion errors are errors when the game has a problem finding a certain file. If you had no problems until after playing for a while, it could mean you either lost one, or that there is an error if you have added external files. "
,spicydeath82,2011-06-11T20:47Z,"Best way to get this to work under windows 7 is to:
copy the contents of the first disk iso onto your hard drive. find the setup exe and change it's compatibility to xp service pack 3. also set to run as admin.
run it. when prompted for disc 2 mount it using it's iso, you may have to manually point to it's data file.
to avoid disc swapping while playing copy the video files from all the discs into the movies folder in the games install direcctory. enjoy."

@laughingninja yes you do have to use daemon tools to play it, you can get it free from this site - http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads just make sure you download daemon tools lite, thats the only free one"
,terrorlord13,2011-09-23T22:09Z,"Hey I thought id make an account for a solution for you all, for one problem at least.

if you keep getting disk prompts and cant get past them this is what you do.

make a folder on ur desktop call it whatever (""bg"" so u know what it is)

then open up cd 1 bin and extrat all that is there into that folder and do the same with all the other folders except cd 6 bin as thats the expansion.

may take a little time but get it done then COPY and paste the little small video files onto there as well.

now when you open up the installer and since all the files are in the same place when u install it will automaticly detect the other disks so when you press OK it will just continue =) easy peezy.

now something i need to know i have the game installed but when i try to play it asks me for disk one so seriously whats the solution to that, and please give a detailed explanation instead of some BS if u actually know, because we dont have all the knowledge u do on the situation so be thourough."
,yoyo68y,2011-10-19T15:17Z,"You guys are making this much harder than it it really is.

Once it asks for disk 2 mount the disk2.cue on dameon tools then go into browse(the one that's prompting you for disk 2). click on cd2 then data.
Repeat the same for the rest of the disks and there ya go.

Note: when you mount the disk on dameon tools it looks as if it didn't do anything, but in actuality it is mounting the disk onto the F:/ drive or whichever the drive the game is using to install the game."
,yoyo68y,2011-10-19T15:26Z,"forget clicking disk 2 then data just click on disk 2. sorry for any confusion.

Remember this is for when you do a full custom install and it asks you for the next disk. If you install recommended then the game will work. but I don't know if it is too the full extent."

Just go back to the prompt and click ok.

,SarethW,2011-10-21T19:13Z,"hey i started downloading this right now
I used to play Icewind Dale by Bioware and i remember loving that to death too
so i can imagine this being superb"
,yoyo68y,2011-10-22T00:31Z,"@sarethW i forgot to mention an important detail. Once you launch tales of the sword coast expansion pack it would most likely ask you for disk1.
step 1. Minimize the game by pressing the windows button on the keyboard. Mount disk 1 on dameon tools and reopen the game (dont run autosetup or anything like that). It should work.
step2. The next time you open the game make sure to mount disk 6 on dameon go directly to my computer  and click on the f:/ drive or whichever drive the game is on to launch it, so it runs smoothly. 

you can try step 2 first to see if it runs that way,  at first I tried step 1 and it worked, but then it didn't work the second time so I used step 2 and now it runs perfectly."

I've moved all the files to a folder on my computer and tried to run from there as well (with the files from the other CDs included as well). Any advice?"
,RogherNahasa,2011-11-17T15:39Z,Thanks.
,underprivs,2012-01-17T08:22Z,"To anyone having the windows 7 install issues, I got it running. Read the following-
I used daemon tools, by the way, so PowerISO may be slightly different, but doubtful...

When you encounter the issue of clicking install and nothing happens...
-Open the file system to the disc (aka=explore) Easiest way is from Computer (used to be ""My Computer"", but in Win7 it just says ""Computer"", for anyone curious) right click the mounted disc image for disc 1 (or the burnt disc in your actual drive if that's your method) and select ""Explore"". 
-Right click ""auto-run.exe"" may be shown as ""auto-run"", then click ""properties"", head to the tab on the box that pops up that says ""Compatibility"", check ""Run as administrator"", and then check the box for ""Run in compatibility mode for...:"" and select ""Windows XP Service Pack 3"". 
-While still in the disc's open files, find ""Setup.exe"" (may be shown as ""Setup"", but make sure it is the application, and not a picture file or config file), and repeat all the steps for the ""auto-run.exe"" I just listed. 
-From there, try the launcher, and click install. 
~I had no issues using this method, although I have been unable to run the TotSC install, even using this method. Put it as simple as possible~
+Notes=
+As for a no disc patch, doubtful, since the game was 5 discs. Just do a full install, and keep Disc1 mounted as long as you want to play. It doesn't kill your PC, so chill.
+Any install errors, make sure to install disc by disc. Don't mount all at once, since it confuses the application. It is possible to do it that way, but if you're unsure of it, just Mount each disc one at a time, swapping mounts at each prompt for a new disc. For help with that, ask.

And to CannabisKing, a tad late for a reply, but if you are still wondering, mount the .cue file, it's an odd system, but for tech learners. A .cue usually points another file (in this case, the .bin) so save trouble of packing a full .iso (.iso is an exact copy of disc, which can be clunky, too large for downloads, or in other aspects, just not right for some folk, like us -wink-). So just mount the .cue, it works just like you are used to."
,OverlordAlexndr,2012-01-24T01:10Z,"OK, avarage user feedback: Thanks to the uploader, it works(although,have to say, a little bit more complicated then most torrents. But then again we noobs need this experience, so not to completely become idiots :])

As for installation goes, here is a WORKING protocol(for Windows 7 x64):
These are totaly noobish instructions. If you cant follow them, either I dont know how to express myself, or you are the king noob of noob kingdom of supernoobs:

1.Learn how to mount images. google ""virtual drives"" or ""mount an image"" for Jack Sparrow's sake!

2.FOLLOW underprivs instructions(the comment above mine), BUT NOT before you turn off/shut down all the ""setup.exe"" processes you have already running. Yes, you tried a zillion ways before you read all the comments, so the failed tries are still running in the background. End them all using Task Manager(Windows).
2.1 Shortcut(for Task Manager): CTRL+ALT+DELETE. Choose Task Manager
2.2 Then in the Processes tab, click the ""Show All users"" button,
2.3 and then one by one end all the ""setup.exe"" processes. This step was mandatory for me, so I am reccomending it.

3. To install the Expansion: finish with the installation of the game, adn then mount the apropriate file(BG Disc 6.cue), and before you run the autoplay, do the same steps underprivs reccomended for the game itself(set the autorun and setup applications to run in xp service pack 3 and also to run them as administrator). This was ALSO mandatory in my experience.

That is as simple as I can put it.

Pozdrav!"
