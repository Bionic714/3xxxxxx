        Release Note:  You may think this release is a renamed DUPE of Mall Tycoon 2. 
        Well you would be HALF (and only half) right. This is from the 
        same people as Mall Tycoon and is the Euro version. But it 
        includes 3 NEW (as in you can only get them from this version) 
        cities which have NEVER before been released anywhere in any 
        shape or form. So, it is not simply a renamed title for the 
        european markets. And therefore NOT a dupe. 
Game Info: Shopping Centre Tycoon is a god management game following the 
        extremely popular Tycoon gameplay style.Building on the strengths 
        of the genre, Shopping Centre Tycoon offers you a more European 
        gaming experience, giving you a number of European cities in 
        which to build your shopping centre, each having their own 
        national landmarks, shops & look and feel.

        London, Paris or Berlin (this is why its NOT Mall Tycoon 2).
