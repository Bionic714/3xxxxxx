This is a story that isn't strictly true..

In 1982, Penn Jillette was kidnapped and locked up at the Bentley Motor Lodge. Ralph Records fed him a strict diet of records, and this is the result.

The record features The Residents, Snakefinger, Tuxedomoon, Fred Frith, Yello, Renaldo & The Loaf, MX-80 Sound, Chrome and Art Bears.

This marks the beginning of another bout of The Residents albums, and
possibly some of the DVDs as my bandwidth is upgraded. Next up are
two versions of the live Mole Show.
