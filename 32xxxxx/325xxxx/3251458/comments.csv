,airzim,2004-10-30T16:47Z,"thank you very much for sharing, Ragowit.
Will there also be an update version of this ?
what is the difference to GoodSNES 204 GoodMerged-GRH.se ? Only Bad Roms missing, or what ? will http://www.grh.se page be back as it where once, or will it stay like this ?
okay, enough questions ;) keep it up ... peace"

No

""what is the difference to GoodSNES 204 GoodMerged-GRH.se ?""
Other compression method and storing method, that's all. It includes exact same amount of roms.

""will http://www.grh.se page be back as it where once, or will it stay like this ?""
It will not stay like it is right now but it won't either be as it was before."

,alexbeato,2005-07-25T04:32Z,Can someone stars uploading this file I have been looking for a great collection like this and when I thought I found it nobody was uploading it. I will appreciate if someone does. thank you.
,True_astoroth,2008-01-10T06:23Z,"I plan on making my own SNES ROMs and Emulator torrent here soon. I'm currently downloading as many as possible. I'm going to go thru them all and rename them and delete any non-english ones, then once I'm finished I'll upload with the most current ZSNES emulator."
,IcySon55,2008-06-30T03:39Z,"I was able to almost completely seed this torrent while I was connected. I was only missing the USA.rar (Had extracted it and deleted the file) I'm reconnecting in the hopes that someone has located the FINAL piece that I'm missing, I can then seed this for everyone. Here's to hoping guys!"
,Philonetic,2011-04-03T16:35Z,Seed please! Dont let this one die
