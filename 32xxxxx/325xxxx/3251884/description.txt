What's Wrong With This Picture? is Van's first for Blue Note and it’s an amazing mixture of all of the influences that have marked his extensive career: the classic, literary-tinged songwriting of “Once In a Blue Moon,“ “Meaning of Loneliness” and “Little Village”, the blues-influenced grit of “Stop Drinking” (based on a Lightnin’ Hopkins tune) or Van’s own “Whinin Boy Moan”, the New Orleans jazz lope of the standard “St James Infirmary” or the Van/Acker Bilk/Peter Collett original “Somerset” and the individualized self-expression of “Gold Fish Bowl” and “Fame.”


With an album cover that evokes the classic Reid Miles Blue Note covers of the 1960s and close to a score of top notch jazz (the legendary Mr Acker Bilk) and session players (guitar legend Mick Green) supporting Van’s unmistakable voice, What’s Wrong With This Picture? is a fitting addition to the pantheon of important music that Blue Note has become.
