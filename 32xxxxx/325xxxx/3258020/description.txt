On July 4th, 2007, a North Korean missile base is hacked and used to 
    launch a Cruise missile against the USS Clarence E. Walsh in the 
    Korea Strait. US Intelligence suspects that the North Koreans 
    were not responsible for the attack, and the US decides to 
    strictly defend against North Korea. While they mass troops 
    to defend Seoul, the Americans also send Third Echelon agent 
    Sam Fisher in North Korea to investigate. At the same time, 
    the Ghosts are deployed behind enemy lines to carry out 
    sabotage, reconnaissance and quick strikes against the NKA should 
    the conflict explode. Officially, not a single US asset is in North 
    Korea.
