The soundtrack from the top 10 movie L.A. Confidential (with Kevin Spacey, Russel Crowe, Kim Basinger, Danny Devito and Guy Pearce).

And the good thing is that the soundtrack to this movie is very good to.
IF you like laid back old jazz, big band jazz, evergreens, back in the background music while you make love, make food, wash up, beat your dog and so on...
Worth the time to download.
