From Amazon.com:

Considered an unprecedented magnum opus when it arrived on two records in May of 1966 (1997's Time out of Mind is actually only about a minute shorter), Blonde on Blonde featured Dylan continuing to demonstrate remarkable powers over the course of 14 new numbers. Working in Nashville with session men and a few conscripted recruits (Al Kooper, Robbie Robertson), Dylan continued to bend minds with his warped lyrics and phrasing. Even dashed-off numbers such as "Obviously 5 Believers" and "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35" contribute to the crazed, fun-house ambiance. Dylan will never be this wild again.

Note: This is an mp4 encode of the new "reissue" version of BoB: Sound is superior, both when it comes the remix itself and the new mp4 standard. You may have to download a plugin to play this, but windows media player usually takes care of that automatically.
