The Grateful Dead have made many, many albums but this has got to be the best and most essential album. If you are interested in listening to the Grateful Dead at all, get this album immediately.

American Beauty shows the Grateful Dead's transition from psychadelia rock to more of a folk-country rock. The songs here are smooth, calming, and really a pleasure to listen to. The band members work as a whole on this album and each song is a standout track. While none of the songs contain the Dead's trademark "live jamming", alot of these songs are live favorites. The song "Ripple" off of this album is one of my personal favorite Grateful Dead songs. Fans of all genres of rock (or any music really) will enjoy this classic album.
