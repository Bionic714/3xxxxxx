follow up to Nine Livez..
slept on as well..

...Nine is one of those artists whos always around but doesn't really make a huge impact on the charts or in the hip-hop community. Much like his first album, Cloud 9 hasn't seen much attention, yet it's solid from start to finish. Nine's raspy, deep catchy voice is ever present, and, with really simple beats complemented by hard bass lines, it's easy to throw this back in for another round. Smoothe da Hustler makes a welcome appearance on "Make or Take," while every other track on the album bangs just as hard...
