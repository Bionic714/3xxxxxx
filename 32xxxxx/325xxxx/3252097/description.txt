This is the Second Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, a priceless record of the evolution & use of the English language.

Originally posted over a dialup, I send my appreciative thanks to Doug for doing this the hard way (see other nfo).

Essentially OED2 comprises just two files; setup.exe & OED2.dat. I burned the data file to the root folder of a CD & setup.exe to a Setup subfolder.  Then ran setup.exe from the CD.  During install, I didn't bother with the Word macro thingy - sounds nice but I don't expect it still works on Word X. This allows you to run from the CD.  Use Daemon Tools to run from disk - see www.serve.com url below.

OUP are doing a cheap upgrade to version 3, so if neologisms are your thing you might consider visiting their website to buy the upgrade - well, I tried!

Problems?
Amazon.com rated this 5-star for content & 0-star for software & I agree! 
However the main software problems have workarounds which are documented in excruciating detail at <a href=http://www.serve.com/xywwweb/oed.shtml>http://www.serve.com/xywwweb/oed.shtml</a> .  
Here you can learn how to rescue fonts, mount the dictionary on a hard drive and overcome startup GPFs, all of which I have done successfully by following the instructions.  I now have OED working on XP & a w2k pcs. If you're a 'tinkerer' you can do it: you will end up with an amazing resource, 
otherwise you might be best advised to leave it alone, as it may not work 
straight out of the box.

Many thanks to R.J.Holmgren for a wonderful job.
