,Dimaspy,2005-03-21T17:39Z,Använd inte crack till spelet. Öppna spel skivan med Daemon tools eller liknande och spela. Om inte det fungerar så installera om spelet eller ladda ner det igen.

,hullupoika22,2005-05-20T18:02Z,För att bränna behövs det ca 4 cd-skivor. Eftersom the sims 2 är så pass stor. För att bygga vet jag inte och undrar hur jag ska göra? Jag extraktar allt med RAR. Det behövs nog inte crack. Men jag är inte expert. Hoppas det går bra för er andra.

,The Duck,2005-06-28T19:37Z,"Hallå, jag tror jag har samma problem som många andra här..
Att när man lägger in cracken fungerar inte byggläget, använd daemontools säger någon.. Men då kontrar sims med att det är fel skiva, alltså måste man använda sig av en crack eller?
Eller bör man ge image-filens ""titel"" något lämpligt namn typ: The Sims 2 play cd"" lr liknande?"

,Avenget,2008-02-26T23:56Z,"Funkade perfekt för mej. 

1. mounta ccd eller cue filerna i daemon tools (ställ in daemon tools att simulera 4 enheter och mounta alla skivorna samtidigt)

2. installera (tryck bara OK när the Sims 2 ber dej sätta in nästa skiva)

3. öppna omslagsbilden som finns med i torrenten (där finns registreringnumret)

4. Spela - Cracka inte! det behövs inte.

om the Sims 2 kraschar, checka att du har ett kompatibelt grafikkort (kolla systemkraven) med DirectX 9. Prova att installera om. Vissa grafikkort har kanske inte rätt stöd för spelet även om de fysiskt sätt klarar det. 

Inget dataprofs kanske men kolla det iaf.

BTW tack för torrenten!"

It doesn't need extracted or anything. And if you're too lazy to find a crack, simply keep the first image mounted. Oh, and by the way, the images have a little orange cone (VLC) icon next to them. Hope i helped. However, the game lags when i place certain things ( floors, walls ), so any help with regards to what's wrong? I don't think it's my PC, as nothing else seems to lag on it. Hey ho."

,newguy69,2009-06-24T22:04Z,"@ jexx666

Ok, i think i know what the problem is. you are NOT mounting it. when i dont mount it, i get exactly the same message. Go ahead and try alcohol 120%, it might be easier to use. Remember after you install it, you allways need to mount the first sims image file called 'sims2_1' to play it. Also with alcohol, unless you un-mount it, it should allways stay mounted.
Hope this finally sorts it out ;)"

Then you want to use any ISO Mounting tool to mount disk 1 which is a CUE file. when the popup that says run setup.exe, cancel out and go to My Computer and open up the mounted drive and right click on setup.exe and run as administrator.

The serial number is in the folder that all the disk images are in. Its called Manuel Sims 2. Input the serial as follows.

Mount the following disks 2 3 and 4 when prompted.

After setup is finish. DO NOT LAUNCH SIMS 2

Go and Mount Disk 1 again and do not run the set up and then run Sims 2.

Perhaps you will find a solution to a problem you may encounter, yeah? If you come across a problem where there is no solution for it in the comments, THEN post your problem and ask for a solution.

,BadJuceBx,2012-04-19T03:58Z,"So i installed it correctly. So I mount it and when I try to play it, it says ""Please insert the correct CD-ROM, select OK and restart application.""
Do I need to burn it to a CD and run it that way?"

,Travelmater,2012-06-24T21:30Z,"Okay this torrent is not good .. At the beginning, which works SUPER! but if you have saved the game and your computer have been closed and the next day sims 2 does not want to play. There is then an unspecified error .. So if you want to play sims2 for 1 hour .. I will take this as roof racks you always want to play sims 2 I will take this Absolutely not, unless of course to me is someone else also? and if it were up to me how can I fix it?"

,MasterOfNotAlot,2012-08-08T19:28Z,"Torrent downloaded and installed fine. Obviously mount in order: 

Sims2_1 > Sims2_2 > Sims2_3 > Sims2_4. 

Upon completion of installation, prior to running the game, go back and re-mount Sims2_1. Also be sure you are mounting each image to the same drive. 

Also, by downloading the previously posted NoCD Hack and mounting the first image, load times are cut down severely. 

However, upon loading in to the game and in to the neighborhood, the game and audio freezes for several seconds then resumes, only to freeze again several seconds later. I've tested my computer and it is well above the recommended requirements, and I am running on XP. 

Even turning down the graphics to their lowest settings results in the same thing. 

When loading in to a house, the game is unplayable. It freezes so much I have to do a hard reset. 

Any help here would be nice. I've tried everything I can think of."

Stop complaining about perfectly regular torrents that have nothing wrong with them. The up-loader is ""trusted"", and is so for a fucking reason! "
,thiagguim,2012-09-08T01:26Z,"
Use the program Virtual Clone Drive 5.4 , mount the image ""sims2_1"" and play.

For Win 7 click the file properties / compatibility and select ""windows xp sp3""

ENJOY"
