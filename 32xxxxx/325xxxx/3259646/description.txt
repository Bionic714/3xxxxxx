Sporting one of those outrageously tacky plots that only the most inept hacks can conceive, THE ABOMINATION features a young man who accidentally swallows a cancerous tumor his mother recently puked up. He in turn pukes up the tumor, which is actually the Anti-Christ.
And...the end result of all this vomiting is that a bunch of flesh-eating creatures take up residence in the kitchen. Our hero feels compelled to don sunglasses, kill people, hack up their bodies, and feed them to these ravenous thingies. 

<b>This is from the recently released Dutch DVD which looks to have been mastered from VHS. The movie was originally shot without sound and dubbed, so don't shout about the sound synch, it's just the way it is.</b>
