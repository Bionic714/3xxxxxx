Alright here's two CD's worth of Leatherface, including the drummers other band Rugrat and one of Frankies other bands Jesse. They are both filmed by me and are the usual high standard, they are also extremely rare. Also included is the appearance on the UK soap Emmerdale Farm where they play a bunch of skinheads causing trouble, very funny. There is also the very rare student made promos for Discipline and more enjoy!
