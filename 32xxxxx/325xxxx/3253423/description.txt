When I saw there was a drum solo from CC here on piratebay, I downloaded right away =) When I saw that it wasn't the best. I seeded this one right away ;)

He recorded this when he just starded in default issues. And I thinks it a great solo! He's only 15 yers old =)
So we salute CC here in england and hope to hear some default issues songs in a short time!
