,iansane,2009-03-06T16:50Z,I don't understand this. 0 seeders so I haven't been trying to download. Finally just cause I'm bored and have nothing to do I start the download anyway and it's downloading a 500KB/s from 6 peers even though it says 0 seeders and 10 leechers.
,iansane,2009-03-06T16:50Z,Any chance of getting the other releases? I know there's at least 4 of them now
