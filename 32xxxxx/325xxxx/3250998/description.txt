O.N.E are from Iceland and this is a surprisingly            
good album. They mostly rhyme in English and the             
beats are melodic and fresh, with some cutting here &        
there. Believe me this album puts a lot of North             
American and European crews to shame. Thanks to one          
of my oldest pals on the net and my man in Iceland,          
Tony Danza, much props for sharing this. Enjoy
