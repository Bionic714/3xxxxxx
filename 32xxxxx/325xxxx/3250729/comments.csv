Och för alla andra, missa INTE den här filmen!!"
,Seb74,2004-10-24T22:04Z,"Tror inte jag skulle palla en hel film med japanska språket :(
Ser för övrigt animerat ut på screensen, men tydligen inte animated enligt IMDB :S"
,Eastpaker,2004-10-24T22:34Z,"woho sub! :D

,Guchi_Jnr,2004-10-25T05:42Z,"Sorry, one more thing, you still left my name it the CD2 srt file.  :guns:"
,Seb74,2004-10-25T06:16Z,"1. Is it regular animation or 3d-animated, or as IMDB says not animated at all?

2. Is it Japanese language?

3. Is it english subs included? (if japanese language I guess it is lol)"

^^
he didnt take credit for the rip? :P he said it was good, and if u dont like him uploading your stuff on other trackers, try to sue him, im shure you'll win!  :rolleyes:

the information wants to be free, the only thing u can complain abt is not getting credits for the rip, thats what the .nfo is for, if a ""group"" on the scene rips a release and strips it of the nfo and they get cought, they wont last for long.

just to show that toba haven touched your ""release"" i'll paste from ""your"" site or whatever :

over and out.."
,Seb74,2004-10-25T08:27Z,"Ok. If its not all animated or 3d I dont think I want it. 
9 out of 10 screens looks very cartoon or animated in some way, but if the movie really is non-animated and real characters and such it will probably feel stupid with the all animated look of things around them.

Just my opinion, I hate bad effects and when things dont look real (unless all is animated of course). 
Thanks for the info :)"
,Guchi_Jnr,2004-10-25T08:47Z,"Glad you like the rip :D

As for naming stuff, I'll leave that up to you.."
,RdictvTaco,2004-10-25T10:51Z,"> Ok. If its not all animated or 3d I dont think I want it. 

It's one of the most anticipated releases coming from Japan this year. But we don't care that you don't want it.

Creds to Guchi for the rip."
,Adurance,2004-10-25T13:13Z,"Toba, jag har alltid velat ha en japansk film källa å så dyker du upp, hel härliga filmer slänger du upp. TACKAR! :)"
,Guchi_Jnr,2004-10-25T13:41Z,Sorry about the subs people. They looked fine on my Japanese XP :blink:
,psykopat,2004-10-25T14:22Z,"Guchi_Jnr, no problemos.. easy to fix.
You don't feel for realese a dvdr of this gem?"
,gargamel,2004-10-25T14:37Z,"thank you very fucking much, i knew it had the realease date 2004-10-23 on DVD info from the official site so i sat biting my nails that all that day an thought. I hope at least 1 japanese dude i ripping Casshern and spread it wide soon or ill start whining everywhere. bakara!!
Thanks again.
I hope a DVDR realease will also, nandeska ? be on its way since many like to enjoy 5.1 dts sound. I guess they have laid a lot of effort on that artpart also and not only the CG art settings. yookai!"
,kzi-,2004-10-25T21:30Z,looks like a realy nice one. thanks to both of you :D
,Adurance,2004-10-26T09:07Z,is it just my torrent that is stuck at 99% and doesnt finish?
,blackgrass,2004-10-26T09:49Z,"Amazing, have been waiting for this one for quite some time now. Great speed also, thanks everyone!"
,animus,2004-10-30T12:12Z,Best torrent info ever! Great work with all the info and pictures. :)
,oddity,2004-11-27T14:28Z,"Cirka sju minuter ""action"" - två timmar och 13 minuter typiskt japanskt dravel (kärlek/känslor/snack) när den är som värst.
Endast för hardcore anime-fanatiker.
Det här är inte en Japansk Matrix som man lätt kan tro."
,Chris01,2004-11-27T14:45Z,seriös kille..  LOL
,WPW,2004-11-27T14:49Z,...och som vanligt håller alla på och gnäller efter svenska subs. Är det INGEN som kan engelska eller???
,Nietzsche,2004-11-27T14:58Z,"Nog rätt många som kan engelska, men nu är filmen supposedly på japanska..."
,SoloX,2004-11-27T15:07Z,Finns det inte Xvid/DivX rip med färdiga engelska subbs i filmen direkt? Blir så mycket enklare på enklare på en extern spelare.
,WPW,2004-11-27T18:50Z,"Nietzsche: jo, jag vet att den är på japanska. Och den har engelska subs, som alla filmer rippade från japanska dvds. Så varför kan inte folk nöja sig med engelska subs?"
,CeronSwe,2004-12-14T14:03Z,Varför bli blir d problem connecting to trcker hela tiden??
,Homeless,2005-03-01T20:23Z,"Oh my, underbart."
,QuentinButz,2005-05-04T23:46Z,"Having a little trouble burning to CD. Nero doesn't support subs, so i tried to convert the avi to mpg with subs using TMPGEnc - but the audio codec isn't supported (AC3).


Has anyone else tried to burn this and been more successful, any advice would be great!"
,Radioactivesago,2005-06-18T17:48Z,Thanks!

,raskit,2008-06-29T22:19Z,"totally useless. quicktime won't play it, divx won't play it, wtf kind of file is this?"
,christian350z_dude,2008-07-09T22:10Z,"to RASKIT,

i havent downloaded this video but im thinking about it.  this is a .AVI file, it can be played with VLC.  if you want to play it with WMP, you have to have K-Lite codec installed."
,Gouldblum,2008-08-04T23:11Z,"I know this is an old torrent and all, but hopefully I'll get a reply :)

Read on the IMDB forums, that the American DVD release of this movie cut a lot of essential scenes out, which really ruined it, so was wondering if someone could tell me what version this one is?"
,giggedyguy,2008-09-03T16:14Z,"Toba will usually give you the original version, so it should be good. You can register at http://bt.avistaz.com/ and get it there as well, though Toba has faster downloads."
,nemof,2008-12-27T21:51Z,"Don't download this, the subtitles are terrible and do not follow the dialogue at all."
,vonkarolinas,2009-01-19T14:54Z,"The .srt doesn't work, I got no subtitles.  How do I fix it?  The fix posted on the first page doesn't work."
,Sachaztan,2009-05-01T01:09Z,The subs provided are HORRIBLE!
,rpgmaker,2010-03-20T20:00Z,This is the japanese version of 140min of running time. Quality is excellent. Thanks.
,Phatfish,2010-04-07T01:35Z,Subs dont work. End of story.
