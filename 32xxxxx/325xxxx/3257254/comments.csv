,guran111,2004-11-21T08:57Z,Hvilken spiller/kodec trenger jeg for å få spilt denne?
,Butterpants,2004-11-21T09:25Z,"Won't play and crashes media player, what do I need to do?"
,KennyKans,2004-11-21T11:26Z,"DivFix says it isn't an .avi-file. What format is it, and what do I need to do to play it?"
,jallaballa,2004-11-21T12:46Z,"Well really...? has anyone else got this file to work without installing a load of buzzware? I´ve tried a number of players but still unsuccessful, so if anyone can provide a link to a codec or plugin, please do so, but don´t insult me with the phrase ""you can find it by Google""."
,guran111,2004-11-21T13:14Z,Got no sound with classic player but it works perfect with VLC Player. Thanks!
,CmdrData,2004-11-21T14:36Z,"Yes well....audio is Ogg. Video reports as Divx5 , but looks like the video is a streaming type. VLC seems to handle it ok.  Suggest the encoder gets a copy of the gordian knot and reads up! :ninja:"

Off course - if you're not familiar with Google or it's to difficult to do a simple search, then I might even consider uploading it for you. :w00t:

Seriously, if you take suggestions as an insult, that's your problem! I really can't be bothered worrying about insulting people that insults that easily!

... and what is so much more trouble installing dubious codec's, when there's a player working fine?

For others i hope my suggestion was of value. I've tried most of the players, MPC worked - both sound and film worked perfectly."
,Butterpants,2004-11-21T19:56Z,Media Player Classic worked like a charm. Thanks.

MPC works like a charm; 49:00 is the best part of the movie, super closeups, no pixilation."
