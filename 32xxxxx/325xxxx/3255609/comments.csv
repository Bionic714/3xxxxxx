,hypnomoosebeaver,2008-02-16T20:06Z,"whats with the second cd? installation only required the first, will I need to copy files from the second cd after the update for the crack to work properly? what is the second cd?"
,RE91,2008-02-17T15:41Z,"Downloading...

Can i play this on internet, or lan with bots and friends?"
,RE91,2008-02-18T09:13Z,"I think its working, But patching takes years ;D If its even patching anything?"
,genxghost,2008-02-29T23:45Z,"FYI, there should be two disks. If you are able to install it, great. In order to finish patching the game, allow the patch to FULLY download, then exit the game, the patcher will automatically start once you EXIT the game entirely, as itll pop up in your corner screen. 

Yes, over 50 servers still in action, several fun mods. A must have."
,matwizard,2008-03-04T19:43Z,"1) 2nd Disc is quite OBVIOUSLY the play Disc.
2) The crack from gameburnwold, is only a NO CD crack.
3) You WILL NOT be able to play this game online. The serial the keygen will generate will have already been registered an almost guaruntee. 
4) It will work for LAN"
,atatyrknumber1,2008-03-08T11:38Z,this game can be played lan???? 
,field33,2008-05-17T17:00Z,"XWIS/Strike-Team has a good serial protection. Or, your serial is banned, or it's invalid.. I think that they are having a connection with the EA Serial system via CommunityTeam... you may ask it lol..

But, the First Decade had serial problems with XWIS, but not at renegade. I've heard that they are fixing it, but atm. it's disabled. Don't know what server it is."

,MrSchmitty,2009-01-16T19:47Z,"For those asking about online play, you can play online, just not via the Westwood servers (XWIS)  You'll have to download GameSpy Arcade (Google it...)  GSA doesn't check your serial, so as long as the serial is working, and your install was cool, you can play online via GSA."
,pcnoobwithexperience,2009-04-11T01:27Z,hey thx i played on st0rms co-op server so i needed disc 1 to re-install since i only have disc 2 with me so i gotta re-install this shit under a different key because this message keeps poppin up saying ($= biatch) williammason seems to use bighead and some other stuff im hoping that re-installing will work =D

,ILoveSky,2010-07-10T01:19Z,"I just installed Command & Conquer Renegade, but whenever I try to skip the intro in the beginning it crashes my computer. So I have to watch the entire intro. Plus, if I try to minimize it or create a Westwood Online account, it also crashes my computer. When I say crash my computer, I don\'t mean the game stops working, now, I mean it freezes my entire comp and I can\'t even access the task manager or anything. Anyone know what could be wrong and/or how to fix it?"
,Phantom_Gold,2010-08-29T02:08Z,Works fine

,john_reiner_celis,2011-02-21T15:21Z,"Good Works Perfectly but no Cutscenes.
How to Finish Practice:
1. Get Armored Vehicle and SuperWeapon beacon
2.Rush the Obelisk or Guard Tower then place beacon
3.Fight your way to the end."
,john_reiner_celis,2011-02-21T15:44Z,You have to Mount Data Disk (Disk 2) to play cutscenes
