A trip through the life of Joni Mitchell, "Blue" became the catechism of the singer-songwriter confessional.  The spirit of this album is as real today as then.  The emotions and honesty of Joni Mitchell the singer, the writer and the musician are indelibly written on the soul of anyone who listens with an open heart.
