Anyway just wanted to say thanks for all the Marx Brothers movies, very much appreciated.

,flexharder,2009-06-22T17:21Z,Terrible quality.. looks like its been ripped from youtube.
,OrpheusDude,2009-06-29T23:48Z,"I have to agree with Flexharder: the quality is really awful, and it's not the age of the film.  Try another source."
,Sanity,2010-01-08T02:37Z,"Yeah, about quality, actually looks like it's filmed with an  Kodak Instamatic 100 from TV and probably best viewed one frame at time;) I'm not so fussy about the image quality; actually I prefer the rugged characteristics of the film which is superseded by the performance of Marx' brothers rather than the other way around. It also includes the contract signing episode resulting in an agreement including just the in-Sanity clause."
