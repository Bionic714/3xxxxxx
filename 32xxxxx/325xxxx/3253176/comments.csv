,night.elf,2008-11-07T17:36Z,"87,4% ... is it possible to have such wanker users? Whats the matter in giving a little back to the community that offers us a lot of GREAT and hight quality files of whatever we want? Audio, Video, Comics, Softwares and so on?
Yeah right... download and disconnect from BitTorrent wankers... :-("
