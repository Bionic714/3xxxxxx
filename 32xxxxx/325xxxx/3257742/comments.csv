,Chaltione,2004-11-21T10:03Z,"when you ask for which one is best, that depends on what you want:

if you want realism, then go for the microsoft train sim, but this one got easier editor, easier driving, and you can drive multiple trains, which you can't in the microsoft sim (as far as i know)

i personally like this one for just ""playing around"", and the microsoft one for a challenge"
,Boass,2004-11-21T10:49Z,"I most often find fun through realism so i think ill go with MS Train Simulator. Hey good response, thank you :)"
