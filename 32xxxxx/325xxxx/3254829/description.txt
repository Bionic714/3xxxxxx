What's New in DFX 7
      
      DFX version 7 is the most powerful version to date, with 
      better audio enhancement processing, graphics and user 
      controls.
      
      * Audio Spectrum Analyzer:
      With the new Spectrum Analyzer you can "see" DFX audio 
      enhancement processing at work. By displaying the sound 
      frequencies of your music, it's a powerful tool which lets you 
      refine your enhancement settings for optimum sound.
      
      
      * Two New Processing Modes:
      In addition to our classic processing mode, DFX now 
      includes two additional audio enhancement modes. The new 
      Music Type II mode is specially optimized to enhance the 
      sound of modern, high energy music styles while the new 
      Speech mode is the perfect for films, talk radio and audio 
      books.
      
      
      * Redesigned Mini-mode:
      With the completely redesigned Mini-mode feature, you can 
      save valuable desktop space without losing your most 
      important sound enhancement controls
