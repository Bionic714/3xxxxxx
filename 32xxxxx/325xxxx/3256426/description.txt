gotta love the hieros..

...Opio mix-tape (i know it's on cd, it's just a term...) featuring 19 tracks 
mixed by DJ Mere of the Oakland Faders. This cd includes Opio tracks from 
his solo ventures, some exclusives, and collaborations with the likes of 
Quannum M.C.s, Encore, Mr. Lif, Hieroglyphics, and the Souls of Mischief. 
Cop this, and prepare for the new album & Triangulation Station...
