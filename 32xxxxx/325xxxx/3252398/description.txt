In 'The Princess Diaries 2', Mia 
Thermopolis is now a high school graduate 
and on her way to Genovia to take up her 
duties as princess (contrary to what was 
presented at the end of the first film, 
Mia does not leave her home for a few 
more years). Her best friend Lilly also 
joins her for the summer. Mia continues 
her 'princess lessons'- riding horses 
side-saddle, archery, and other royal. 
But her complicated life is turned upside 
down once again when she not only learns 
that she is to take the crown as queen 
earlier than expected, but that she is 
also to be married before this event.
