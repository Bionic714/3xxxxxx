In a quiet, isolated village in olde 
Pennsylvania, there lies a pact between 
the people of the village and the 
creatures who reside in the surrounding 
woods: the townspeople do not enter the 
woods, and the creatures do not enter the 
village. The pact stays true for many 
years, but when Lucius Hunt seeks medical 
supplies from the towns beyond the wood, 
the pact is challenged. Animal carcasses, 
devoid of fur, begin to appear around the 
village, causing the council of elders to 
fear for the safety of the village, the 
pact, and so much more.
