this is how it works, TPB does not host your DATA, it hosts your HASH LINK, therefore if you delete it off your hdd before anyone gets it, bamn, failed torrent.  and you sir, earn an epic fail, this is your second time posting this? lol, your wasting your time.

i learned the hard way, look at Marsdentech, he knows how to upload stuff, and he knows how to MAINTAIN torrents, untill enough of his peers have downloaded it to maintain its life so he can delete it safely.  take my information into hand and don't forget it.  TPB is not a download site, its a torrent search site."
