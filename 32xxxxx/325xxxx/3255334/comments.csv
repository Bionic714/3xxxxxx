WMP 10, WinAmp and Irfanview, however, refuses to play it. What is worse, it won't burn properly to disc, and I'd like to watch these classic episodes on my TV instead of a puny, little 17' monitor.

Does it play properly in your WMP? If so, it might be something wrong with my download. If not, then there might be something wrong with the file.

If you could, I would very much appreciate it if you could put it out separatly. It is THE most classic episode of all (in my opinion!), and it would be great to get it in down in perfect order.

By the way - thanks for uploading this fantastic series. It is much appreciated."
