Sometimes, you just can't save the whole galaxy by yourself, and nobody knows this better than the cat-like space mechanic Ratchet and his little robot friend Clank. Maybe that's why new multiplayer features are the focus of Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal, the third installment in the gadget-happy PS2 platformer series from veteran designers at Insomniac Studios. Split-screen play is supported for up to four players on the same console, and as many as eight can join up online, with full voice-chat support, through the PS2 Network Adaptor accessory and a compatible USB headset device.

Up Your Arsenal features six maps designed specifically for multiplayer competition. Players work with teammates to beat rivals in "capture-the-flag" styled contests, using the limited assortment of the game's far-out weaponry that can be found in each area. Modes of transportation, such as the Turbo Slider and the Hovership, also encourage teamwork. The game's vehicles can carry two players at once -- one driving and the other (quite literally) riding "shotgun" (or "lava gun," or "blitz gun," or "sheepinator," as the case may be).

This third Ratchet & Clank game also features a full-fledged adventure mode, designed to be at least as story-driven as the duo's first two games. After saving the galaxy (again) in Going Commando, Ratchet and Clank were finally getting the attention they deserved -- or at least Clank was. He became the star of his own action-adventure television show. Perhaps a bit nonplussed by his sidekick's sudden stardom, Ratchet is ready for another adventure when the evil Dr. Nefarious hatches a scheme to eliminate all organic life in the galaxy, and the two are called back into action.
