,Subspsycho,2004-11-08T18:43Z,"Very nice release! I was looking for the music of UFO for a long time, and I only found 3 CD's...This is EVERYTHING :-D. After ordening etc. I have 156 different songs (live-versions excluded); 11,6 hour of music!! :-D

Quality of MP3's (The last CD is in MPC, but this is for example convertable with dBPowerAmp) is very good. Some of the CD's (about 3 I think) have cracks in the audio (I think this is recorded from vinyl/LP or something), but usually a remasterd version can be found elsewere."
