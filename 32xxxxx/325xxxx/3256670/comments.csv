,redfury91,2012-05-31T23:03Z,4 different folder with 8 different CDs? what a fucking joke. good luck everyone. 
,zoloftian,2012-06-17T04:48Z,"For anyone having trouble getting the game to work, here are the steps I used.

1)Mount the CD1 .cue or .bin file using your preferred virtual drive program. DaemonTools, MagicISO, etc. Run autorun or setup.

2) Insert your serial. You can get a serial here. http://www.serialportal. com/serial.php?im=73734

3) When prompted to insert the second CD, mount the CD2 .cue or .bin file and click 'OK.' Same for third and fourth CDs.

4) After installation has finished, run the Tribes Updater contained in the torrent.

5) Re-mount CD1, and browse to  crack TV_CD_DVD. Copy this file.

6) Find the directory to which Tribes has installed. On a Windows machine, this should be something like C: Program Files VUGames Tribes Vengeance Program Bin. Paste your copied file here, and make sure you select REPLACE when prompted by a dialogue.

7) Launch Tribes. I recommend you run it as administrator, under Windows XP compatibility settings. It does not appear that you have to keep CD1 mounted to play, though if you encounter problems, try playing with it mounted.

I'll try to help if anyone has any other issues."
