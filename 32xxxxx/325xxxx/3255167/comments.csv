,ckramerrr,2005-06-23T15:14Z,"is there a decent player which can view the episodes even if 99% complete. Vlc and mediaplayer do not work. Torrent is 99.2% complete but the following eps cannot be viewed:(23/06/2005) :4,5,9,10,12,13,21,23,24"
,marthe83,2005-06-29T04:17Z,rename the missing episodes and it works.  Take away the last letters .bc!   so it ends with .avi.
,ckramerrr,2005-07-01T18:11Z,THe eps can be seen but some parts are missing or else there is only jap even if 99% complete.
