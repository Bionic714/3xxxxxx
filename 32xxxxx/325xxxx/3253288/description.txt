1. Unrar. 
2. Burn or mount with daemon tools. 
3. Install the game. 
4. Copy over the cracked executable located in the /crack dir on CD1 
5. Play the game. 

NB: On some testmachines we encountered that the game defaulted to Dutch 
language regardless of what was chosen during install. Should this 
happen to you, do as follows to switch to English: 

Click Opties (top right corner), select Instellingen. Change Taal 
(top option) to English. Then click Bevestigen (bottom left) to 
confirm.
