AMG Review:
Enoch Light has become synonymous with the space-age bachelor pad scene of the
mid- to late-'50s, owing heavily to long players such as this. However, the reality is
that the former Light Brigade leader produced and directed Terry Snyder's loose
aggregate of instrumentalists known as the Command All-Stars. What sets the
numerous volumes of Provocative Percussion (1958) and Persuasive Percussion
(1959) -- as well as countless spin-offs -- apart from the plethora of other easy
listening combos was Light's innovative use of technology. Most notably, experiments
in extreme stereo mixing that took advantage of what was then considered an
audiophile-only novelty. He also became one of the pioneers to document audio on 35
millimeter film rather than magnetic-based audio tape. Not only did this allow for a
broader range of frequencies to be captured, it greatly increased the stability of the
playback. Undoubtedly, that is one reason the fidelity of his analog masters sound
better and more animated than those made nearly a half-century later. This title,
Persuasive Percussion (1959), was the first in the series and is often cited with
helping usher in the ultra-cool space-age pop genre, which became visually
recognizable thanks to John Lautner's unique Googie-inspired abstract artwork that
graced a majority of the gatefold LP jackets. The vibe within the grooves is equally as
postmodern (at least in 1950) with highly stylized interpretations of a dozen
standards. Such thematic variations sonically depict the era with swelling Hammond
organ solos and arrangements replete with bongos, maracas, as well as all other
dimensions of hand percussion. These are balanced against the understated jazzy
melody lines from Dick Hyman (keyboards) and Tony Motolla (guitar). Sure,
incisive [read: cynical] modern ear may dismiss these renderings of "Miserlou," "I
Surrender, Dear," and the Tiki-informed version of "Tab√Ä" as retro kitsch. Sadly, that
would be missing the point entirely. In 1995, Persuasive Percussion [Compilation]
was issued on CD with six additional sides from Persuasive Percussion, Vol. 2 (1960).
