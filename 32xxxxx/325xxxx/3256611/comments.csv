,MaxNormal,2005-06-11T14:55Z,"Now I'm not sure what Mr Lee was thinking here, having your name attributed to this work of nonsense, is like running down the street naked with your hair on fire. Hardly going to bring forth positive reactions. 

The effects are too cartoon for words, and the storyline has been murdered. 

I'm not going to type anymore. 


IMHO rating : 5%"

,tomimama,2005-07-27T22:13Z,"Some body, please, please, help me.

My divx player says this when I play the movie:

""the video film you are opening includes audio data that is not recognized by the DivX Player.

The file contains the following type of data:

Audio data: Tag 8192

You may need to install a new codec on your computer to listen to the audio""

Where can I get this type of a codec to my player?

Seems impossible to find this movie with good quality anywhere else, only 700mb copies are left."

OH GOD! I'm so close to completing it, please can someone seed for a bit? 20 mins max..."
,thamask21,2010-01-07T05:19Z,Have to disagree with people flaming this movie...it was better than the incredible hulk and much more realistic to showing how powerful the hulk really is...bullets don't knock the hulk down they bounce off...yes they do...so do sound waves fired from sound cannons
,jt2215,2011-07-15T22:58Z,I really could use a seeder

video  10

this is a 2 dvd set both are here this is a complete movie here

this is  the 2003  the hulk   w eric  bana  and jennifer connelley and nick nolte
 NOT to be confused with later 2009  the  incedible hulk  w ed norton and tim roth

this has no subtitles   but go to  subscene and there is a set of subtitles for the two dvd set and they sync perfectly with movie here

this is the english language version of the movie

then u have a complete movie night set up for yourself

this worked perfectly  on my computer w gom player or km media player there was a poster who had problems try these media players maybe

thanks for the time and effort put into uploading this"
