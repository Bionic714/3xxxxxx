"Bungee Jumping of Their Own" is an ingenious title for a film about reincarnation.

To depict the human soul as bungee jumping from one incarnation to the next may be the most apt metaphor for reincarnation. Modern metaphors and colloquialisms are always the most profound means of expressing age-old concepts.

The story begins with Shu In-wu (Lee Byung-Hun, star of Joint Security Area) meeting In Tae-hee (Lee Eun-Ju) by chance at a bus stop and offering her shelter under his umbrella until her bus comes. Unable to forget her, he returns to the same spot the next day hoping to find her. The sequence is handled poetically with time exposures and slow motion shots showing passersby fading into stills and vanishing like so many phantoms.
