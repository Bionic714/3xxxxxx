,Const2k,2006-01-25T11:03Z,"Fine. That's it (1/3). Game works fine if you download 100% of this torrent and do as info file on CD#1 says (though you'll have to run one renamed (.e -> .exe) file from your HDD). In case you have some CDs out of these, you'll anyway have to download CD#1, as keygen, patch & cracked .exe are all there (unless you'll find them yourself elsewhere in Net)."
,Const2k,2006-01-25T11:04Z,"(2/3) Note that CD#1 is modified, hence game won't accept it (as someone here already complained).  Cracked .exe here makes it work properly, but is OK for running PATCHED NWN WITH BOTH EXPANSIONS, NOT for just original NWN."
,Const2k,2006-01-25T11:05Z,"(3/3) Also make sure you have enough disk space for it (about 5 GB), at least 500MHz/128 MB/32 MB with recent video drivers and about an hour to set everything up properly :) To speed things up you can keep both keygens (themselves, not shortcuts) at hand - just copy them to Desktop temporarily."

,The_Avatar,2006-03-19T04:25Z,"I solved the _AIL_set_stream_volume_levels@12 problem.

But I guess there is no way to play cracked version online? This game is so good that I could even buy it if I'll be able to find it cheap but do you guys know if it is possible for me and my mate to play this game online at the same time with only one copy of the game? I mean if we're using same cdkeys we can't play at the same time?

And can this game be played on LAN? Every time I press on ""Multiplayer"" I have to create some sort of account..

Thanks anyway!"

Do as said in _info_.html but DON'T install the 1.64 update and DON't install the cracked nwmain.exe.

Then start the program, but DON't play. Instead click 'Update'. The updater will be updated and then the game will be updated to version 1.68 which is the newest and doesn't have a disk check anymore, so no need for a crack.

also I use a Mini-ISO since 1.68 dosen't have a crack, get it from GCW ;)

bzImage123 Diamond Edition is in 1.66, If you install all by seperate you get to 1.64... 90 mb the patch to 1.68, use the auto-updater and if it fails to update due to a file that is incorrect in size download the critical rebuild from nwn.bioware.com "

just keep trying to install it, that is all you can do.  mine installed on the second try.

2: why do you need rar's....there is no reason at all to rar files that can be resumed.  piss off.

3: the keygen is on the cd.

4: you cant play online unless you have a real cd key.  the only way i could see one to be scammed is with the diamond edition manual not having a cd key printed in it.  you can scan and send it to atari and they will give you a key. "

I run the game, the various corporate names come up, and just before I get to the title screen, BAM, ""Neverwinter Nights has encountered a problem, and has to close"".

Is there something I have to do to fix this, or is this just some bullshit that I have to deal with for my computer?

- A way to fix the problem where you see the opening movies but it closes after them is to actually go into the files and delete the opening corporate movies in the ""Movies"" folder, but not the final loading one and that worked for me great. 
Remember to only delete the opening ones though ( ""AtariLogo.bik, Bioware.bik, WOTClogo.bik, and possibly NWNintro.bik)

just mount the iso's to install as every game should be. then after the installation, run the update through the launcher, then at the very last it will say that the update patch has aborted, close it. then download the CRITICAL REBUILD 1.69 and CEP v2.1 from this link (the one on the site doesn't seem to let me) it also has a guide on how you can work both those updates:

http://tregonia.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1271&view=previous


then after doing those updates, if you're running Windows 7 (any type), right-click on your desktop shortcut of neverwinter nights then click on Properties
click on the Compatibility tab, then on Compatibility mode put a check on the ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"" box and select ""Windows XP (Service Pack 3)""

the game should work perfectly then on Windows 7, because if you did not change the compatibility mode it will just simply close down after clicking the play on the launcher and show the neverwinter nights logo, so I suggest this to all Windows 7 users. I'm not sure to Vista users though if this is necessary but there's no harm in trying. hope this helps.

Thanks uploader for the game :)"

Where else would you get the update? O.o "
,Patritscha,2011-06-19T03:56Z,"Everything worked fine until I tried to play the actual game.
Told me to enter the CD key again, but altough I used the exact same ones as in the Installation (and they worked there), said my CD Key was invalid.
Tried out some other keys created by key gens than, but nothing worked. 
There also is a file in the NWN Folder where you can check the keys in the installations, and they are the ones I used trying to start the game. Anyone know whats uo with that? Why do I have to enter the Keys again anyway? 

Installed the newest Update, too."
,EelsUp,2011-07-02T05:53Z,"Fuck this torrent all over the place. NOBODY seems to have got it fully working, and even the ones who have seem to have issues once it gets off the ground.

Aside from that, I got two warnings about harmful files when installing it. Maybe it'll work for some of you, but I'd rather spend the five bucks on Amazon for the game than deal with the headache of trying to install this piece of shit."
,Zanda777,2011-07-05T19:35Z,"@Eelsup Yes i got warnings too. Microsoft security essentials told me about a threat called powerregscheduler.

Heres a link to what its purpose is;
http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?name=Program%3aWin32%2fPowerRegScheduler&threatid=9940

It is also made by the company Bioware that made this game so i don't think it will harm your computer in any way, but it is seen as a threat. I recommend ignoring it and not registering your game. 

Have fun guys and enjoy."
,Zanda777,2011-07-05T20:55Z,"Also, the critical update patch is outdated in the torrent and so is the CEP update file. Use link below for critical update 1.69 and CEP update 2.1;

,mrwelling,2011-08-03T22:39Z,is there a way to play online sumhow? what is the point in cep patch if u cant play online?
,liquid07,2011-09-22T09:46Z,"Game works perfect,

Use this link for 1.69 as they all seem to be leading to biowares store :

Patch Included in Crack dir is named wrong and wont work, just copy and paste to your computer somewere and rename, simply add ex to the end (to add the file extension .exe, patch is named .e)"

,josh210,2011-11-30T02:54Z,Did anyone else have to register their game?
,lycanized,2011-12-04T03:34Z,"After you mount the install 1 image, go to the place where that drive is and right click it, it will have the neverwinter nights icon and will also have the name of that iso, right click it and then go into that folder. That is where the crack is..."
,boobs69,2011-12-23T22:26Z,"Seriously you guys? you make it way too hard for torrent noobs and make people doubtful of a good torrrent like this. OK this is what i do personally:
1:download file and open with Utorrent.

2:(i use PowerISO to mount games so i simply right click the .iso file and click ""mount to drive F:"") With game mounter mount the first CD (exit out of any autoplay window that pops up)

3:open up ""My Computer"" and right click the port you mounted it to click open NOT autoplay.

4: open up the ""_crack_"" folder and open the ""Neverwinter nights key generator"".

5:once that is open minimize it and go back to the previous folder and double click the ""autorun"" application. (the icon that is an eye with black around it)

6:when prompted mount the second install CD and browse for it in""my computer""

7: when it ask for the key number maximize the keygen you minimized earlier. then type in what the key generator shows you. (dont type in in the dashes ""-"")

8:mount whatever CD it tells you to after that.

9:just keep clicking next during registration and type in some fake email and adrress.

10: from here just keep on following instructions of the setup.

PLAY THE GAME! (recommended that you restart your computer after installation)"
,slightblue,2012-01-09T18:19Z,"Hi,

got the game working with one quite annoying exception: Everytime I safe, quick- or regular, the game starts to use up 100% of the CPU, which makes it unplayable, astonishingly, automatic saves do not trigger that effect.
I'm running it on virtualbox 4.1 with W7 ultimate 32 bit.
Help in terms of what causes this would be appreciated."
,galaxialgrave,2012-03-10T03:24Z,"This torrent is a piece of shit. I followed the instructions above yet I had to try re-installing the vanilla game seven times before I got it working. The MS322.dll file is corrupted, I had to try another crack from another site. The installation of SoU aborts near the end every time. Worse, I got an alert about a file which I decided to ignore because hey, it's Bioware. My laptop's just ended being slow as fuck for hours until I deleted the file. Kudos to the uploader, the OC works fine, but nothing else does and I get an error when I try to uninstall it. The uploader is a fucking arsehole for uploading this. Only try this if you're willing to spend hours trying to get it work. I'd have rather have waited for Amazon to deliver it to my house for a fiver than spent so much time on this piece of shit torrent."
,dogmaaraan,2012-03-30T03:14Z,"thank you, worked perfectly for me.

although had same issue as slightblue (choppy/laggy gameplay)  but found game was only running on one core, changed it to use all and it ran fine. (Start task manager, go to NWN process and set affinity)"
,dogmaaraan,2012-03-30T03:16Z,"sorry let me change that, didnt read slightblue's problem properly. game was slow at any point, changing affinity solved problem."
,Garfelt,2012-04-05T00:51Z,"I will second that if you have issues on windows 7 not opening the game just run in XP compatibility mode.

Other than that, following the instructions provided installed the game perfectly. Ripping on the original uploader because you can't get the game to work is asinine when it's obviously working for many other people. "

,Juxhin_666,2012-06-03T17:45Z,IT FUCKING SUCKS. Fuck you all motherfucking cunts.
,en1337u,2012-06-17T08:35Z,"I'm using Windows XP SP3. I installed everything correctly but I get the error ""Neverwinter Nights has encountered a problem and needs to close"". What to do?"
,igadoter,2012-06-19T07:24Z,got the same issue as @en1337u....game crashes immediately after the start....I won't spend the rest of my life to think what's wrong..I'll try another torrent
,igadoter,2012-06-19T22:37Z,"I'm doing faster than thinking....for me the game runs without  the crack....I mean with crack installed game crashes instantly...So I removed the crack...Original  launcher during boot is asking about the CD with the Horde of Underdark...this is CD 5 in the torrent...I mounted the CD using Daemon Tools and game started....I played a bit with a video configuration...Looks like now game is stable enough to play..but I have to save often...I expect that  the game will crash time to time..these are some video driver issues..as I understand....my box is Athlon II X3 455, Ati HD 6850 ...the Catalyst v. 12.4 (recent)...  .   Thank's to the uploader...   "
,Chaoscom,2012-09-09T17:58Z,"Basically, the update included with this torrent is listed as an ""e"" file and not an ""exe"" file, so it's worthless. Online the latest patch update is 1.69. You're probably going to get that if you google for a patch .. DO NOT CRACK THE GAME WITH THIS PATCH. It removes the CD check. If you crack the game you lose the ability to play it."
