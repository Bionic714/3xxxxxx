        Special Release Notes. 

        The Shania Twain story has opened on a new and 
        exciting chapter, and the only way is Up! That's 
        why, even with her place in the world's 
        musical elite guaranteed and undisputed, the 
        only way is UP! for Shania Twain, because of the 
        creative goals she has already achieved with the 
        album even before it starts flying out of the 
        stores. "Mutt and I as a team put more into this 
        record than ever before," she confesses. "We 
        really have gone totally all out, we've laboured 
        over it and I'm completely thrilled with the 
        results." 

        Her new single "Party for two" is released in 
        two versions,a country version featuring Billy 
        Currington and a pop version featuring Mark 
        McGrath. The Greatest hits Collection also 
        features 2 new recordings. 

        "I put this music on and I'm overwhelmed with 
        emotion. It's been such a labour of love, and as 
        I'm listening back sometimes I don't know 
        whether to laugh or cry."
