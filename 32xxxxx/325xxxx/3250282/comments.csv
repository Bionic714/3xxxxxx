,Woundead,2005-02-21T14:38Z,"ngn mapp == någon mapp

Hur man installerar står ju i instruktionen du får med och/eller kan läsa här.

Viktigt att den följs i minsta detalj, annars är sannolikhten mkt stor att det inte kommer att fungera, iaf på win xp.

skriv gärna vilken del som är svår med instruktionen så kan jag/ngn annan nog hjälpa dig."

,homejeans,2007-07-17T17:55Z,Everytime I lose life in a duel Internet explorer occurs with a mistake....?? How can I help this????? please help! My drivers are updated....
,Zensch,2007-07-19T01:13Z,"I just can't get this to work.

I extract the zip files to C:\Magic. Then I run magic.part1.exe and let it install to C:\Magic. Next I run Setup.exe and choose C:\Magic\Program as destination folder but it gives me an error saying ""The installer cannot find Manalink in the target directory. Please select the right directory""

Can someone please help me out?"
,Zensch,2007-07-19T01:19Z,Got it to work by running setup.bat in C:\Magic\Magic
,Meche_C0lomar,2007-12-25T20:46Z,"OMG, finally I've found this game. Thx all for keeping the torrent alive for 3 years."

,Criscoh88,2008-04-02T03:33Z,i didnt really like the game. magic workstation is way better. also i had an issue with the menus blacking out on me. other then that the game works fine.

,rabbort,2008-06-12T14:17Z,When editing my deck I can't see any of the cards I  take out (in the bar at the bottom). Any solutions to this? It's like they just disappear. I am running in 2000 compatibility mode
,MacLaine2,2008-07-03T16:43Z,Why am I not able to buy cards in the towns?
,Ausnen,2008-08-04T01:20Z,Looks like shit and plays like it too
,Arlad,2008-09-16T23:45Z,"This sucks... No one can really help or anything.
I´ve installed the game and updated it with manalink and set compatibility...

But when i start the game, i cant see any text or whatsoever... Can anyone please help?"
,damedley1,2008-12-23T20:30Z,"I think this comment has been made in Swedish already, but I have problems with the Deck Editor.  When I bring it up inside the Shandalar game I can't any cards I own other than what is in my deck.  I can use the ""Move all into deck by color"" button.  But not only is that pretty annoying, it doesn't allow me to select oddball lands - Mishra's Factory, Strip Mine, all the dual lands etc.

It's disappointing to say the least.  I've even tried looking through the save files to see if I can hex-edit my decks!  Has anyone encountered this problem and fixed it?"
,damedley1,2008-12-23T21:02Z,"Missed a word:
I can't any *see* cards I own"
,luca_turilli,2008-12-24T00:50Z,"Nu minns jag inte i detalj vad det stod, men det var något i denna stilen.

När jag skall köra setup och lägga den i c:magicprogram så får jag medelandet ""could not fint the directory"" nått sånt. 

Vad gör jag för fel?"
,Thorbears,2009-02-01T13:37Z,"Good torrent, thanks.
And thanks to Andre.h for the ""How to"" guide ;-)"
,pedjamusic,2009-02-06T11:19Z,"Thanks!
I don't have real ppl to play with, so this will do just fine :) I've started to love MTCG because of this PC version."
,pedjamusic,2009-02-06T17:01Z,"I didn't encountered a single problem.

I'm using Vista Home Premium 64-bit. All I did was to unpack .exe+.rars to c:\magic\program\ and run .bat file.
I didn't change compatibility nor anything else. Just went to start the game and everything worked like it should.
Deck builder works like a charm, facemaker too, game itself works great, sounds are present..."
,demitri_giovanni,2009-07-18T05:41Z,"Great seeding people, keep it up. Thanks Woundead, and everyone kind enough to seed. "
,Abe95,2009-07-21T06:53Z,"Although I do understand Swedish (I live in Norway), using English would be helpful, as most people understand English better than Swedish. English is my second language, but I understand it better than my first language."
,True-Haven,2009-08-02T06:33Z,Waste of time
,bonnie2002,2009-08-03T01:02Z,"hi guys,

,nickguyatt,2009-08-19T17:54Z,Nice torrent.
,vajkos,2009-08-28T19:42Z,"Hey I was hoping sombody would know if this torrent contains the micropose expansions ""Spells of the Ancients"" and ""Duels of the Planeswalkers"" because I already downloaded another version of the original Micropose game.  Thanks"
,antsareus,2009-09-03T22:22Z,good thing you shared with the rest of us having problems with deckbuilder bonnie.
,antsareus,2009-09-03T22:28Z,"To fix the DECK EDITOR problem. Disable x-fire, msn and other non-essential sys tray programs.

This will fix it when the cards are not visible. however i still get a program crash error in regular deck builder :/"
,Gd_hentai,2009-09-03T22:42Z,"Im having a problem of not having any Text on the cards or on the game in general, any suggestions as to how to fix this, great download, im currently seeding, thanks for that"
,antsareus,2009-09-05T16:08Z,"Bug fixes:
To fix the ""No cards in editor"": Disable background processes like X-fire, logitech mouse, Msn, and so on..

To fix the ""Deck editor Crash"" bug: Set windows resolution to 1280x1024 maximum. (Widescreen will crash it).
This will also help with the no-text bug, but not 100%.

Hope it helps, peace."
,kamichan,2009-11-25T23:10Z,Hey is the game itself in English? Or is it Swedish as well?
,Byurn,2010-04-10T14:46Z,"Tack! Bra för folk som inte har tid att gå på träffar. Underbart att din UL överlevt i sex år!
