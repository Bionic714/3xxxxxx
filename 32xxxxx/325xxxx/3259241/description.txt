AMG Review:
This is the first album release from the often maligned though talented and 
singular group the 5th Dimension. 
Released in 1967, this set was the first with Jimmy Webb, who contributed to 
one track and arranged and conducted 
the whole effort. The most well-known song remains one of the finer songs of 
the decade. "Up-Up and Away" matched 
the group's gorgeous harmonies with a great and ethereal yet full-bodied 
production. Their cover of the Mamas & the
 Papas' "Go Where You Want to Go" is such a carbon copy, Billy Davis Jr. 
probably wore one of John Phillips' big 
hats for the session. Despite that groundbreaking song, Up, Up and Away is 
mostly the group finding their sound 
with mixed results. The cover of "Poor Side of Town" is pointless and the 
Motown-inspired "I'll Be Loving You 
Forever" comes off forced and as phony as a sack of three dollar bills. Up, Up 
and Away is certainly commendable 
for the style forged here but even better work was ahead for the group. [The 
2001 reissue came with bonus tracks.

enjoy and seed :)
