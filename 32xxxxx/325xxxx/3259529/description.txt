AMG Review:
Prior to this album, Al Green never had a number one song. 
The title track, "Let's Stay Together," achieved that status 
and held it for nine consecutive weeks. Green's ingenuity 
produced one of the all-time classics, which has the bounce 
of a dance cut and the passion of a ballad. The dynamic 
soul singer's whispers, animated cries, and riffing enhance 
his already stirring delivery. This album was sold on the 
strength of the title track as there were no other selections to 
grace the Billboard charts. However, this album includes the 
timeless gem "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart" and 
lesser-known beauties like the exulting "Judy," the cookin' 
testimonial "I Never Found a Girl," and the soothing blues 
effort "It Ain't No Fun to Me." The Arkansas native and his 
creative partner Willie Mitchell season these selections with 
lucid rhythm arrangements complemented by the faint strums
 of a guitar and brawn, unchiding horns.

enjoy and seed :)
