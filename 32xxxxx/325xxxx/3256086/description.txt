Här är en engelsk förklaring på denna superba mjukvara för tweakning :)
Även om det står t.ex "LinkFox (TweakMASTER PRO only)" så följer det med.
Hela kittet.
Don´t worry, Be happy.

Advanced Ping and Traceroute is an enhanced version of popular utilities for troubleshooting network connectivity problems, traffic congestion, and other related problems. TweakMASTER's integrated implementation offers a "swiss army knife" for network troubleshooting, and enhances the traditional implementation is many ways.


Network Connections Viewer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Connections Viewer is a tool which lets you see all currently established TCP connections, and see on which TCP and UDP ports your computer "listens" for incoming connections.

Seeing what programs open network connections, and to which hosts, can give insights to what's really going on behind the scenes on your computer. Network Connections Viewer is an investigative tool which can come in handy when you suspect privacy violations by some of your software, or when you suspect infection by a worm or virus. Seeing what ports are open on your computer can also be important in the evaluation of your computer's security and protection against hackers.


Smart WhoIs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WhoIs is a searchable database maintained by network registrars that contains information about domain names, IP addresses, networks, networking organizations, and the contacts associated with them.

TweakMASTER Smart WhoIs is a utility that queries different WhoIs databases. It selects the correct WhoIs server automatically, therefore eliminating any guesswork. Smart WhoIs supports more than 200 different WhoIs databases.


Keep Connected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) disconnect users that appear to be "idle" and not doing anything productive with their Internet Connection. This happens more often during the peak hours when the ISP's infrastructure is overloaded. And of course, once you're disconnected, you are faced with repeated busy signals when trying to re-connect. If you have such an ISP, TweakMASTER can help you to stay online at all times.
