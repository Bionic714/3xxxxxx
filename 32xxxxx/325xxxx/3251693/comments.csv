Can somone please explain how i transfer the edirol orchestral into my Fruity Loops ?

,artytorrent,2007-10-12T11:07Z,"I got this torrent elsewhere, but it's well worth having if you want to have access to some pretty realistic orchestral sounds.
Install from the Arctic setup.exe is simple (if slow) and once the dll is in your VST plug-ins folder, the synth should be available alongside any other plugs.

This VSTi sets up a 16-part instrument in your sequencer, which is controlled by MIDI. In FL Studio, you can use it in the effects section and use up to 16 MIDI outs for a huge sound.

The string sections are particularly nice, with a range of preset bowing speeds, vibrato and tremelo settings. There are even a couple of drumkits thrown in, so if you want authentic timpani rolls or a marching band sound, this is ideal.
There is a bug-fix update to version 1.03 of the dll at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3767998/Edirol_HQ_Orchestral

Thanks for uploading."
,designed2play,2007-12-29T17:29Z,Excellent
,joeybhoy,2008-01-10T17:12Z,thanks
,patton303,2008-10-05T11:25Z,"Awesome!
Fast download too. :]"
,sleepercar1,2008-12-13T01:57Z,"hey there im a novice at this stuff so some help would be appreciated. usually theres a readme folder which tells me how to install the program. but i cant seem to install this one. ive run the artic setup.exe file and installed everything, but i cant find the program anywhere on my computer. all i got are Help files... any help please?"
,Taxidermy_Time,2009-02-20T00:13Z,"I am very satisfied with this torrent. 
Good job Eporti. And thanks a lot.

I am seeding by the way."
,BasSmurf,2009-04-16T22:17Z,"Hey guys, responding to artytorrents comment, I tried to make a quick demo on getting all the channels in Orchestral to play at once without having to open 16 or so separate instances.

The file is in HD and there is no sound, but you don't need any :D

,jimmay,2009-05-03T23:12Z,"Thank you for posting this, it works great, and if you follow ArtyTorrent's link you can update it to 1.03.

At first you may assume this is just a mediocre app, but the quality of the sounds is surprising. I use Symphonic Orchestra Gold most of the time, but it's just not possible to load up that many samples on an xp32 system (not enough ram) so this is a great tool for composing."
,pietastesgood,2009-05-08T04:11Z,How do you run this after installed? No exe.
,heartlessentity,2009-05-17T10:10Z,"For those who cannot figure out how to run this, it's a VST. There is no .exe file. You must have a host (most any DAW: Reaper, Pro Tools, Mixcraft, etc.) to run the file."
,wraithguard01,2009-06-10T09:25Z,"This is perhaps one of the best torrents I've ever gotten before. Mad props, even though it's 5 years old."
,blahblahblah9000,2009-08-18T10:00Z,The app contains a trojan dropper.
,orwellkid,2010-03-24T22:41Z,"Spyware/Virus/Trojan-Free, Scanned by TrendMicro and Avast.

This is a great up, thanks!"
,Skulastic,2010-10-01T04:24Z,is this mac AU compatible? and does this software have a good horn section?
,skater555,2011-08-24T06:37Z,"Can u try uploading >Sonokinetic Tigris and Euphrates KONTAKT , sonokinetic_voices of israel< ?"
,aculaone,2011-12-18T17:07Z,somehow everytime I try to uninstall Edirol VSTi my machine crashes and automatically restarts. Any suggestions as to WHY? 
,Sploder,2012-02-07T18:21Z,"This is a really amazing vsti, I've been playing lord of the rings music with it for hours now! Might actually buy it if I use it in a song. Thanks alot!"
,Man_Goat,2012-04-30T23:37Z,"Some nice sounding instruments on this - just what I was looking for. Torrent works.

HOWEVER... if you save a project and want to come back to it, you must save each instrument, one-by-one, and re-load it EVERY TIME. Painful."
,Sploder,2012-05-26T23:51Z,Yeah had to stop using this one unfortunately due to this problem. Oh well its fun to mess around with.
,gadgetzan,2012-07-11T21:57Z,"Can't even use this any more. As if the fact that I have to reselct the instrument on EVERY track when I restart the project wasn't painful enough, this VST tends to fuck up everything for me. All of a sudden all sound from Cubase can stop working and the program will crash when I try to exit it. I can't export anything with this VST running either, it will stop at around 1% and if I don't crash the program with exiting it it will crash by itself after a few minutes. Completely useless to me, it has great sounds but this just isn't working."
,xXAstrixxXx,2012-07-18T20:28Z,"Very fast torrent. It works well and is clean. 

By the way, to all of the people saying that it is a pain to use because of saving/using more than one of these on different tracks to make it work, you are making it complicated for yourselves. I got it to work in FL 10 and Live 8.

Go on Youtube and search up some tutorials. You can save your arrangement and all of your settings. You also only have to load one of these to make it work properly in a project (i.e., using midi tracks to control the different tracks on this VST, thus decreasing the amount of RAM you need to run a project by using only one of these). If you have a bit of patience, and if your DAW is half decent, you should be able to use this properly. 

TL;DR: This is a wonderful torrent and you are most certainly not wasting your time."
