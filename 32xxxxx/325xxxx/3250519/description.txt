Brand new EMINEM track , from Encore !!
I wasnt even gonna rip this until i saw one group
rls this, Their rip is tagged as "encore", im not
sure which is proper name ours or theirs, but theres
more wrong that just tagging... Its stupit to bitch
about INT rips , but if u wanna do INT rip why dont
u do it good. Their rip is 192kbps, when ours is APS
(--alt-preset standard), enjoy.
