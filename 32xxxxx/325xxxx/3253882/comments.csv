,sparks79,2011-04-21T06:15Z,"2 CryTech & hannower
what is wrong with people?? who do you mean?? DO YOU MEAN PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT FROM YOU?? there is nothing wrong with them - they only like different things than you.

or 

DO YOU MEAN YOURSELF?? you, and others who are unable or refuse to respect others and their rights, are very very wrong. I can immagine exactly who you are - white, working class moron who never met his biological father, livins somewhere in suburbs with his white trash mother who just as you blames all her failures on anyone who is slightly different."

,00sweeney,2012-08-23T02:50Z,"Sparks 79, have you considered the fact that hannower *may* be referring to the fact that many people had downloaded but few were seeding. Because I'm gay, and that was my first, second and third thought. NOT that he was being homophobic. 

There's no comment from CryTech, unless you're referring to the comment from lenyma, which is just a question about why he has audio but no video.

And gpx005 is right--even if he was being homophobic, that little tirade you went on is not only a stretch, but it *does* make you look like the idiots who put us down. Stereotypes are stupid no matter who's invoking them. We're supposed to know better."
