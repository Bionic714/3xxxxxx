***All These CD's Are Properly Tagged***
OK
Here is number 15 in my popular comp series. I think you will find something for every mood a punk could be in with this collection. There will be some bands you know and others you don't but they are all good so please check them all out. I love discovering new bands and i hope you do too!

As before this will fit on an 80 minute CD for easy back up, so download the whole lot and give them all a listen, you may discover your next favourite band, please leave some feedback if you like any of these bands.
