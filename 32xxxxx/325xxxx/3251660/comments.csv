,LE_265E,2009-03-19T21:49Z,"Setup.exe on CD1 contains PWS-Banker trojan.  It has potential to really screw you (steals passwords if you use online banking), and this game isn't worth the potential headache.  Unless someone can come up with an easy way to clean up the Setup.exe, don't bother downloading."
,bleak_7,2009-03-21T16:14Z,"Nothing worse in this world that seed beggars.

Good game BTW.

Painful cut scenes and enemy re spawns but a good throw back to classic FPS'"
,crativ3,2010-06-07T12:21Z,"to an old comment from LE_265E... there r no virus there... ever all these ""key-gen""s online don't have viruses, ur anti virus program scans the file and finds a ""special"" combination of codes, and THINKS its a virus (hehe thinks...)
dont always trust the anti virus program..."
,unreal,2011-03-09T10:08Z,Fails the cd authentication test while installing with Deamon tools. I remember I burned these cds one time and it did not work either. what can I do?
,DyO152,2011-04-05T15:38Z,"hope it's cool
