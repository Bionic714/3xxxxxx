,jdrake_2,2006-08-01T05:31Z,I realize beggars can't be choosers but what's the video quality like - like a VHS copy or something lower?
,tavisjohn,2006-08-11T09:59Z,"Well seeing that this has not been aired in...  And it is not on DVD, so that leaves VHS to PC transfer.  Personally I am impressed that it is as consistant as it is!  It looks fuzzy on a PC screen, but comes out clear on a TV."
,jdrake_2,2006-09-04T16:14Z,"Thanks for this.  The quality is VHS quality and watchable.  It looks better in a small screen than a large screen, at least on a computer monitor.  Unless you can afford the expensive DVD release, worth checking out."
,draculade1931,2007-04-09T15:11Z,"That's great, but I am looking at least for the english closed captioned subtitles. If you can provide them (the subtitles), that will be glorious."
,lukas,2007-11-22T15:12Z,Thank you! I LOVE WESTERN!
,Faloma,2008-03-07T20:50Z,"The files are fairly big for the quality... on the PC the original screen size is so small to expand it you really lose a lot and it get fuzzy. really not worth watching on PC.

Some one mentioned its better on TV so I will defiantly try that."
