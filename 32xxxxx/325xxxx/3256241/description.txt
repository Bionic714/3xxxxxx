The adventures of Brisco County Jr, all episodes from the first and only season. Brisco chases villaigns in the wild west with a modern touch. You can call it a wild west James Bond. Think the show is from 1993, but it's still great, with action and lot of humour. This is a TV-Rip with no subs, english language. Enjoy
