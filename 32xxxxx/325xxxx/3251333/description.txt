  Tin Soldiers: Alexander the Great is pioneering many new and exciting 
  features. Favoring the grandeur and hand crafted look of miniature figures 
  we are eschewing the current gaming trend toward ultra realism. Our artists 
  spend their time drawing hundreds of individually adorned soldiers rather 
  than countless hours animating clones of identically clad animations 
  scratching their backsides! The game plays like a beautiful miniatures battle 
  from the historical units down to the table terrain, but with the advantages 
  of a computer opponent and a more dynamic turn structure.
