Description :
Koios Works' Tin Soldiers - Alexander the Great is a turn-based, simultaneous-play wargame with a classic feel and a reaction system to allow mid-turn adjustments to strategy. Aside from covering the most famous conqueror in all of history. Tin Soldiers - Alexander the Great places you in the role of Alexander the Great during his conquest of the known world. You will fight the grand campaign from inheriting your Alexander father’s mantel at the battle of Thebes to his conquest of Darius III and the Persian Empire and last great battle at the Hydaspes. Tin Soldiers: Alexander the Great also presents the wargamer with a unique miniatures-oriented feel with graphics of hand-painted, individually adorned soldiers.
