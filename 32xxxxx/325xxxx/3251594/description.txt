Lost S01E06

6. House of the Rising Sun

Walt and the others are shocked when Michael is brutally beaten, but only the non-English-speaking Jin and Sun know the truth behind the attack. Meanwhile Kate, Jack, Sawyer and Sayid argue about where the survivors should camp -- on the beach, where they-re more likely to be seen, or in a remote inland valley where fresh water abounds; and Locke discovers Charlie-s secret.
