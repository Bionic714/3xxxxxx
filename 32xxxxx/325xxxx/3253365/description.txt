  Return to Mysterious Island follows Mina, a strong young woman alone on a 
  round-the-world sailing expedition. Caught in a tremendous storm, she 
  becomes stranded on the shores of a wild and apparently uninhabited island. 
  As she explores her new surroundings, she uncovers artifacts, living spaces 
  and technologies left behind by the people who came before her to this 
  uncharted island.
