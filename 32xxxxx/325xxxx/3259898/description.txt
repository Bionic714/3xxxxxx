Classic progrock/electronic work by a long-time progrock keyboard player. Excellent stuff, sounds a little like Jon Anderson on some vocals. Long out of print and very hard to find. I'll be re-seeding this every Saturday (midnight, PST/PDT). If there are no seeds available, leave your client up or bring it up on Saturdays.
