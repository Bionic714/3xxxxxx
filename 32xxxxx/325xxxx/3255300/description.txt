OK here's a new version of the LWT Year Of Punk, this was the second special report on punk rock done by London Weekend Television. The first one was only 30 minutes, where this one is 44 minutes and uses some footage from the first but includes lots of new bands as well. Some of the footage has been used in almost every documentary on punk, but this is the original show. This copy came from the archives and is great quality, enjoy

The Year Of Punk LWT 19 December 1977 SVCD 44 minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
