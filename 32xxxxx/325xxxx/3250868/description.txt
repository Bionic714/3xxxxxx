At long last, Aladdin is about to marry the Princess 
Jasmine. Despite the presence and encouragement 
of his friends Genie, Carpet, and Abu, he is fearful and 
anxious. He is most worried as to what kind of father 
he will be, having never known his own. But when 
the 40 Thieves disrupt the wedding trying to steal a 
magical oracular talisman, Aladdin is drawn into a 
dangerous quest to stop the thieves...and find his 
long-lost father.
