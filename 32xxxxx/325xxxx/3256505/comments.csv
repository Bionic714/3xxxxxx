What program can I open with?"
,raymond140,2009-09-13T00:53Z,"I don't think this software is real......appearance, looks like it was designed back in the '70's. No setup for communication cables. Don't waste your time!!!!!!!

If you must try this file......open with ""PowerISO"""

,djmopa,2011-02-09T16:52Z,"This is designed to educate a person about Emissions and testing. The program is not a OBD II software program that is used for computers, so if your looking for something to use to be able to find error codes and be able to fix your car, this is not it. For the majority of people, this download is worthless."
