Fun rock music, taken out of print thanks to the label going belly-up. This album was played entirely on toys bought from Toys-R-Us. Shows you how much good writing/playing/mixing/engineering can make anything sound great. I'll be re-seeding this every Saturday (midnight, PST/PDT). If there are no seeds available, leave your client up or bring it up on Saturdays.
