Now you can convert your DVD's to your Pocket PC and watch them in          
       great quality, with stereo sound and in full screen landscape mode.         
          A memorycard as small as 128 Mb is sufficient to store a full            
        length feature film, up to a hundred minutes. Take your DVD's on           
        the plane, train or automobile, watch them on vacation, at work or          
         at school. With only two clicks, this PC software converts the            
       content of your DVD to a super small movie file, which will play on         
       any Windows Mobile 2003 device, such as HP iPaq, on a postage stamp         
        size memory card. You can use a headset or the built-in speaker to          
        listen to the sound. Subtitled and foreign language DVD's are also          
         supported. You wil have to see the quality to believe it, using           
        Microsoft's supreme Windows Media 9 encoding, feature films look           
         crisp and sharp on your Pocket PC and still fit on a relatively           
        small Secure Digital card. On a 512 SD card, you can even crunch 4          
                                     films!
