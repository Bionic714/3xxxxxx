,Hasse82,2004-11-11T21:46Z,"BTW, I also have Brisco County jr, all episodes. It's about 9gb, so I don't know if it's worth for me to make a torrent out of it. But if anyone wants it, or know anyone who does, please feel free 2 speak up, and I will seed it as soon as possible."

,moui,2005-01-01T18:56Z,"Hi there, I downloaded this, and I cannot watch episodes 8-10 because there is no audio. Has anyone else experienced the same problem with this? If so, were you able to fix it?
Please help!! Really want to see what happens in the last three episodes
Thanks, Moui"
,moui,2005-01-01T19:13Z,"This is just a follow up on the question I recently posted about not being able to watch episodes 8-10.
Problem Solved!!!!!
I needed to download an xvid audio codec in order for it to work. It was called and A3 audio codec if anyone else needs to know!

BTW, thanks for placing this on the site!! Awesome show, havent been able to find it ne where else!
Thanks a bunch!

,papaboo,2005-02-02T14:37Z,"I get ""incomplete"" when I start the download. Running TorrentFlux 1.3. Is someone familiar with this problem?
Also, on undertexter.se are only episodes 5 and 11 available. Where can I find the rest?

,erinder,2005-04-06T07:39Z,"I've downloaded about 7%, which includes the entire first episode I think. (694 mb) But when I try to play the first episode, none of the players I tried recognized the file format. Why is this? Will it work when I've downloaded all of them?

(please bear with me, I'm new to BT..)"
,Pjiotor,2005-04-10T00:45Z,"erinder, yepp"
,bliitz,2005-05-09T00:34Z,"erinder: usually bittorrent downloads small pieces from every part in the torrent during the download. as for an example: if you download an album, you often can't listen to any of the songs correctly until you've downloaded the whole album, because bittorrent doesn't download one song at a time, but pieces from every mp3. i'm not sure if it works this way but i know that things won't play correctly until you've downloaded the whole torrent"
,snokern,2005-07-08T02:58Z,please seed!! im stuck at 0.0%:p

,whocares401,2008-08-05T05:57Z,"I spent a week grabbing Earth Final Conflict and this show is sooooo much better.  I've missed two episodes and ep 5 was not shown tonight, so this set better be complete.  The show is a Sci-Fi grabber.  And I was hoping that it would share some insights as it starts off at Roswell in 1943 (the year I was born). Acting is superb, special effects are excellent (the sets reflect the times) and this will become a classic.  Grab it while you can."
,whocares401,2008-08-05T06:01Z,"Yea.  I'll share as long as I can once I get the whole thing.  I'll share what I can while d/ling what is available.  My ISP throttles my uploads, so be patient.  Spielberg does it again!"
,nickbbad,2008-09-02T07:53Z,Could some more people please seed this and thanks for uploading Hasse82 this and band of brothers are by far my favorite miniseries. Again Thanks and thanks to all seeders!

,skorzeny75,2009-03-21T21:33Z,"I downloaded this, and I only get audion on my Windows media player, but no video. I downloaded codecs, but this did not give me video. Does anybody have any ideas?"
,WvBrsci,2009-11-09T23:57Z,"Great upload! I've been looking for a decent torrent with this, and there certainly aren't many of them. I'll be seeding this for a good while to give others the opportunity to enjoy it as well. Also, great to see a torrent stay strong (relative term, of course) for this long. It'll be 5 years in two days!"
,kc8gpd,2009-12-20T17:55Z,"Steven Spielberg Presents: Taken

imho is one of the greatest scifi et flicks in history.

the fact that it takes true abduction stories dating back as far as 1947 and intertwines them so well with special effects and a great story line will make this movie become a classic like 2001 a space oddessy and close encounters of the 3rd kind. i mean shit the upload date is 2004 and just look at the stats 5 years later :)
"
,clyj06,2010-03-02T05:03Z,"ive been looking for this for some time now. great upload! anyway, to those seeding thanks a bunch! and because you guys are still seeding i will be doing the same. thanks again. and to those who can seed please do, i really love this series and would really appreciate the help(ill be glad to return the favor).=)"
