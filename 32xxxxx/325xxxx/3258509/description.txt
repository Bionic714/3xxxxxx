OK here's a rare Dag Nasty show featuring Shaw Brown from late 1985 at the famous 9-30 club, if you like Minor Threat then you will love this as its mainly from the Can I Say album which is like a more melodic Minor Threat. I will post a few more Dag Nasty shows over the next few weeks, enjoy!

Dag Nasty-9-30 Club Washington DC 1985 SVCD 37 minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
