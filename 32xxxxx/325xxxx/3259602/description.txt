OK here's China Drum and Doctor Bison who supported them, this is another one i filmed back in 1996. Doctor Bison features Dickie Hammond from Leatherface on guitar so another rare one for the Leatherface collectors. The China Drum show is excellent,theres only a small crowd but boy do they enjoy it, the stage diver who dives like he is at a big show is worth watching out for, enjoy!

These are in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and they will play in most DVD players. They will fit on 2 80min blank cd-r using nero.
