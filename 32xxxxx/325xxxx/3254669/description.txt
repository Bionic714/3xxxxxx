Eftersom den förra från DvP inte var helt OK så lägger jag upp denna

RIPPER NOTES:
DvP's release has audio desynching on CD2 and was nuked for it.
Besides that, the subs are quite messed up. 40 minutes of CD1
are missing and scrambled with the CD2 subs, meaning they appear
at the same time as the subs of CD2. Obviously this isn't a
proper reason, but still worth mentioning. We provide you with
a rip without audio desynch and proper subtitles.
A sample taken from CD2 is included for comparison.
Enjoy!
