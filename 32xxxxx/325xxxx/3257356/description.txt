When this five-song, 25-minute EP was released in Japan in 1989, it served notice that Neil Young was capable of writing powerful songs and playing fierce rock & roll again, a fact confirmed by the subsequent release of the Freedom album. Three of the songs on Eldorado turned up on that record (including "Don't Cry" in a different version), but "Cocaine Eyes" and "Heavy Love" did not, making this disc a necessary purchase for Young completists.
