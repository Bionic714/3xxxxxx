    - --- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------>

    For years, the success of planetary colonization has resulted in 
    several planets to become inhabited by humans. While the majority 
    of colonies have aligned to form the ISA, the Helghast, a ruthless, 
    militaristic separatist faction have distanced themselves secretly 
    planning to scale an all out war. Killzone takes place during the 
    initial Helghast blitzkrieg of the nearby colony of Vecta. As Vecta 
    City's orbital defenses mysteriously fail, the Helghast have been 
    able to land and deploy their troops rapidly and with ease. As the 
    planetary defense forces become overrun and scattered into the 
    city, the initial objective as an ISA member is to escort a 
    high-ranking official to an evacuation point.
 
    ... and much more!
