It is near future, 2032, people are connected to the computer network, 
and they can communicate each other without talking or typing keyboards. 
The most parts of their bodies are replaced by machineries. It is a world
where human, cyborgs, and robots are living together. 
Batou is a detective of a governmental agency, which is responsible to
control terrorists. He is a living cyborg, and his hands, legs, and the
other body parts are artificial. It is only his brain and the memory 
of a woman, Motoko, that remain.
One day, a girl-type robot loses the control, and kills the owner. 
He wonders why that robot killed the owner. The robots are to be made 
to work for human. He begins to investigate the affair with his buddy,
Togusa. Then a mysterious hacker interferes with his investigation by
attacking his brain from the computer network. Suffering from the 
attack, he is gradually approaching to the truth.
