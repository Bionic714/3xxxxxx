i havnt downloaded it and i wont do it cus i got it the legal way ;)

Same Errors (AI_DISABLED) and same Copy from ISO file

i could be wrong on this"
,TheOrion,2004-11-19T19:46Z,"Its not taken from emporio.. we made it by almost the same way.. 
But we made it before emporio.. (check the dates on the files).
And our release is smaller and 100% working proof =)"
,Ozz,2004-11-19T19:54Z,"Blir det här ett gäng ISO-filer att bränna till Cd eller ska man bara lägga hela skiten på HDn?

Undrar för att jag bara har en liten stackars HD på 10gb."
,TheOrion,2004-11-19T19:55Z,tyvärr så måste du lägga den på hdd:n eftersom att detta ej är ripp av skivan.. dock så ska du kunna bränna ut den om du har en DvD brännare då den tar va 3.5gig
,zakimo,2004-11-19T19:56Z,"So you managed to do a virtual steam server?
and why did you do a ISO file? thats kinda lame, why not just pack them in some RARs? i mean, doing an ISO file that you need to extract anyways is kinda stupid"
,TheOrion,2004-11-19T20:06Z,Being able to burn it out to dvd by using an image file is could be the reason
,LeMyssla,2004-11-19T20:13Z,Snyggt att du kommenterar din egen relle.. Som att gå till snuten & be om böter...
,zakimo,2004-11-19T20:14Z,"You can still burn it to an DVD if its RAR files
and you didnt answer the other question..."
,TheOrion,2004-11-19T20:18Z,"Jag har inte gjort rellen mr kul...

and for your other question.. HL2 asks for steam to validate version and it get an answer that it should ignore the update.. quite simple"
,zakimo,2004-11-19T20:32Z,Im tired of all Wannabies that want to take credits of others work. 
,Sagg,2004-11-19T21:09Z,I've tried the ROOB fix with my Emporio release and it didn't work. Still it wants to connect to steam and crashes.
,TheOrion,2004-11-19T21:52Z,Download this release and check wich date and time its made. and then compare with empirios.. and you will see who was first..
,Rexicon,2004-11-19T22:29Z,funkar den
,zakimo,2004-11-20T00:47Z,"Omg, you know that you can change time/date right?..."
,zakimo,2004-11-20T00:49Z,"http://www.febooti.com/products/filetweak/

,BandC,2004-11-20T03:08Z,"Instead of download it BUY IT!!

It doesn´t cost that much.
Support Sierra instead of make a economic disaster for them.

I can understand if you download something from EA Games but Sierra?

You´re lame"
,Rexicon,2004-11-20T09:32Z,im not sure that this game works clean on my pc and thats why i download it!!
,tveta,2004-11-20T10:31Z,"It doesn´t cost that much.

What is the differens with sierra and EA, and Konami and so on. Theay can make games much cheaper but they do not want to do it. Because they want to earn big money from our small peps. If they games are cheaper than I WILL buy it in store instead.. So by now I download games.  "
