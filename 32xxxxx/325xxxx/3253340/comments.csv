Is this the director's cut version ?"
,el_chiquillo,2004-11-06T16:49Z,"Hi, I don't know if this is the Director's Cut. But I'm almost sure it is.  Enjoy"
,pook,2004-11-09T21:52Z,Does anyone know where to get subtitles for this? English - Swedish?!
,zzzo,2004-11-23T20:52Z,"Is there subtitles with the movie? I only found subs for a 2-cd rip, but this seems to be only 1-disc? Can somebody help?"
,technicolor,2005-06-24T02:34Z,Bad video quality
,Tabun,2005-07-28T15:59Z,"It is incredibly hard, if not impossible, to find a subtitle for this version. It seems to be the least popular release of the movie, and I don't see why the 1988 release is nowhere to be found..."
