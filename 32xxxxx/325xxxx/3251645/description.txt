The Bard's Tale is an action/role-playing game in
which the player takes on the role of the Bard -
a sardonic and opportunistic musician and
adventurer, driven by carnal rather than noble
pursuits. The Bard is not interested in saving the
world, his humble motivations are strictly "coin
and cleavage."
