Your comment is completely unhelpful and it makes you look like an idiot.
Bitrate is something most people prefer to know before downloading."
,stonelesscutter,2011-03-26T22:21Z,"Obviously this isn't 320 kbps, judging from this other torrent which is 320 kbps and has a larger downloadsize.

The files in this torrent are likely 256 kbps or perhaps even 192 kbps."
