      opposing forces in a major crusade. Colm Feore plays Lord Marshal, a
      warrior priest who is the leader of a sect that is waging the tenth
      and perhaps final crusade 500 years in the future. Judi Dench is
      Aereon, an ambassador from the Elemental race. She is an ethereal
      being who helps Riddick unearth his origins.
