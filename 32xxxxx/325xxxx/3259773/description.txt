    Taking place in a  massive,  free-roaming  city  featuring  five distinct 
    interconnected  neighborhoods,  Need for Speed  Underground 2
    delivers an 
    immersive game world where the streets are your menus. As players 
    explore 
    the city, theyâ€™ll encounter rival racers who will school them in the ways 
    of the underground and tip them off to the hottest racing spots in town.

    Deep  new  performance  tuning allows gamers to fine-tune every   
    aspect of 
    their ride's  handling  and  performance,  while  hundreds  of new visual 
    customizations  guarantee  players  can  create  their  own  
    personalized, 
    totally unique car.

    All-new game modes join Circuit, Drift, and Drag events to add  depth 
    and 
    variety, pushing car and driver to the limit, while more than a dozen new 
    cars and  hundreds of  aftermarket  parts  from  the biggest names in 
    the 
    business make Need for Speed Underground 2 the deepest, most 
    authentic 
    tuner experience ever.
