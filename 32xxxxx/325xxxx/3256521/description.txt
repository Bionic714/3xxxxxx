These are Jaguar service manuals all models post 1987-? They are in a weird format and require the reader (Included). Just run the .exe on the root once you burn the cd. It is in nero .nrg format. Very useful for Mechanics or Automotive Repair Shops. Enjoy. IF YOU HAVE AUTOMOTIVE PROGRAMS (MANUALS, PARTS, MANAGEMENT, ANYTHING) GET AHOLD OF ME AT TRACKER.PIRATBYRAN.ORG AND SEND ME A MESSAGE - I WOULD APPRECIATE IT.
