Alright here's a couple of real rarities, first up is chumbawamba from 1987 in Liverpool, no tubs being thumped here LOL. Next we have Bow Wow Wow on American Bandstand, enjoy!

Chumbawamba-Liverpool UK 1987 SVCD 35 minutes
Bow Wow Wow-American Bandstand USTV 15 Minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
