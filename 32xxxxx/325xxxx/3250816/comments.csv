How about you read the description of the file you are down loading and you'll find all the info you'll need for a successful download! My God! So what if there's a password on the file, its ot that hard to find you muppets!!!!

@Flying_Thor, I got all the description I needed in the title and downloaded this torrent right from the search results. Now I have to come back, research it, and look for a dumb ass password..."
,theeccentrik,2012-04-21T03:28Z,If any file has a password totally ignore it. Most take you to a site where you have to sign/subscribe to other sites before letting you have it. 99% of the time their is no password it's a scam!
