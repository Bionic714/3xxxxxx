,SKK,2004-12-03T07:25Z,"Hittade iso-filer under annat namn på annat ställe(kommer desvärre inte ihåg var), men ta mig tusan om det inte samma filer. Nu seedar jag dock ett tag.

Tyvärr var den del 1 jag fann _inte_ bin/cue filer utan även de iso så där kan jag inte hjälpa eventuella leechare. Sorry!"

,ragglare,2005-03-31T22:05Z,"""killercat"" du behöver rosetta stone's maindisc.
gjorde en snabb sökning här på TPB och hittade 2 stycken.
den som var mest seedad var ""http://thepiratebay.org/torrents-details.php?id=3273322&hit=1""
installera den så går det nog bättre..."
,twitch_77,2005-07-31T13:09Z,"alright guys, before i go ahead and try to burn this (i can't read sweedish). . .
i extracted. . .now i need to know exactly what to burn onto a cd.
there's tons of folders. . .and 3 files:
CATMPC.TRS
CDID.TRS
CREDITS.TRS
do i just burn these 3 files onto a disc. . .pop the disc into my computer, and then run stone?
on do i have to burn all the folders along with it? (it adds up to over 2 gigibytes with all the folders, so i'd need to use a dvd).
thanks for any advice.
thnx.
"
,ragglare,2005-08-10T23:10Z,"twich_77.
You don't need to extract those file's.
Just burn the bin/cue with nero or alcohol 120%, or mount them with deamon tools.
It's only 2 CD's, but to use them you need a Rosetta Stone main-disk installed.

good luck.."

,brutalspoon,2008-02-14T12:15Z,"Hey everybody,

I know that this is under the windows section, but does anybody know if these language files will work in the mac version? Obviously if it were applications it would be different, but since these are just language files being read by the app...
I guess this is a stupid question either way :P"
,Link48010,2008-05-14T04:41Z,Please PLEASE Seed this torrent. I really need this thing.
,neilfraser121,2008-06-20T05:38Z,"Hey, can anyone tell me if this is the new version 3 of Rosetta Stone Japanese? Because I have used the old one (v2) and I just got the v3 of Japanese Lv 1 and I have to say, the new one totally kicks v2's ass.  seriously it's about a million times better!"
,neilfraser121,2008-06-20T05:41Z,"sorry, I'm a dumb ass.  I just checked the files and it's v2.  Does anyone know of any torrents for v3 Lv 2?
