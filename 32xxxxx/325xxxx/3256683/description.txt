Pro Boarder lets you compete in a variety of snow boarding events from the 
high-flying SuperPipe to the blazingly fast Midnight Express. Overall there are 
nine different events to compete in and, while there is a bit of repetition in 
gameplay (most boil down to downhill racing, performing midair tricks, or a 
combination of the two), each has enough character to keep you going for the 
gold. Of course, the main thrust of this game is to get vertical. X Games Pro 
Boarder is all about catching some massive air and doing the big tricks. The 
game features over 2000 special moves, everything you can think of from backside 
1080 3X frontflips to boneless tail grabs...
