Om Hicks:
Bill Hicks was the last great social satirist, the true descendent of comedians like Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor and Mort Sahl. The self-described "Prince of Darkness," his work confronted the hypocrises of late-20th century American life, divining comedy from the more evil impulses of the government and the mass media while assaulting the soullessness of mainstream culture. An alcoholic, coke addict and chain smoker, Hicks also experimented heavily with hallucinogenics, and his monologues addressed issues of expanded consciousness and spirituality rare to the comedy format; for all of the rage inherent in his stand-up, his message was one of transcendence -- as he frequently reminded audiences, "The truth will set you free." -- Jason Ankeny (AMG)
