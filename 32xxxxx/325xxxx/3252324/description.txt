NFO:
,.notes...
- You know what this is... blah... Full English language
in Campaign mode, also has subtitles depending on what your 
xbox been set to (i.e Spanish, Spanish subs), but all english language 
- Ripped : Nothing    
- For DVD5 users, rename the image to diff-hl2.iso and use the 
Halo.2.DVD5.Kit.PROPER.READNFO.XBOX-GGS , it will just delete 
the unnecessary files to make it fit into a dvd5, but all data   
will still be maintained.   

ME: Finally, a version with english audio. Oh, and i'm also seeding Halo.2.DVD5.Kit.PROPER.READNFO.XBOX-GGS
