,brovol,2008-10-03T19:00Z,"I've seen two other vids of Bill Hicks and I'm yet to be impressed by this so called comedy genius. Sorry but I like comedy, not gratuitous foul, vile, language and behaviour. There's being 'blue' to get your point across, and there's being a complete and utter moron... Hicks is the latter."
,collateral187,2008-11-01T04:39Z,"brovol, I registered just to tell you you're a fool"
,travette,2008-11-13T09:38Z,i second that collateral. brovol you suck!! anyway what i wanted to say was that this video is either missing portions of sound all the way through and picture is distorted ........... or it didn't download to my computer properly. annoying!!!
,leibniz-1646,2009-01-20T20:50Z,"Brovol, I believe what you are trying articulate is, you like comedy acts such as Dane Sucks Jeffreys' Cock, where the comedian walks around on stage underwear only like a fucking idiot talking about how he wants to be a snake and how cool it would be. Or acts, such as Jim I suck at stand-up Carry, where he throws his arms above his head or one arm looking mentally, need to be genocide, retarded. I'm very sorry you don't have enough brain activity to think on your own to enlighten yourself Brovol. Good luck to you and your sister and I hope you two have a wonderful honey moon. Thank you very much, and good night. I'll be here all next week."
