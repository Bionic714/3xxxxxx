As the title suggests, Aswad's Roots Revival is a conscious return to the roots of reggae, a return whose aim is not to flee from contemporary problems, but to relocate the aching hope and passion for life that existed in Marley's most engaged and political songs. With more than 15 albums under their belt, Aswad are veterans of reggae music. They've experienced all of the changes that reggae has undergone over the past two decades. So who better to lead us back to the promised land?
