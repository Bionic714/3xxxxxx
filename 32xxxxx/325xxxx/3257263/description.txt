This is not the DVDrip that was released 19-11-2004 by  team PLuS.
This rip was made 2004-09-10 
I have had this film for a couple of weeks but I did'nt post It earlier due to the fact that I did not have any subs...

The sub that is included now are made by team PLuS I guess..and at the end  of the movie they go slightly out of sync but that problem is easy to fix.

A proper set of subs will probably be available at Kloofy's any day from now.

Quality is good.
Enjoy
