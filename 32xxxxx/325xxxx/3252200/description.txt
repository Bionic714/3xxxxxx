  GAME INFORMATION: 
------------------- 

  As in the first Knight Rider, the player will play K.I.T.T. and must use 
  all the unique features that this famous car was capable of in order to 
  successfully complete missions. Whether it's driving in ski-mode in narrow 
  alleys, utilizing night vision to see where others can not, chasing the 
  bad guys with incredible speed by activating the Turbo Boost or scanning 
  buildings to analyse a situation, Knight Rider 2 will still offer all the 
  thrilling features associated with the original K.I.T.T. car of the TV. 

  In Knight Rider 2, KITT is now also capable of Combat mode which will 
  raise the gameplay element significantly with the player using different 
  car-based weapons to fight off robots, armoured vehicles and of course 
  Garth, Michaels evil twin-brother and arch enemy. Mini Games such as Dirt 
  Track Racing and The Shooting Gallery add to the excitement and fun. These 
  Mini Games may be unlocked by successfully completing certain missions. 

  Furthermore, new tracks and environments, some with unconventional 
  surroundings, will definitely add to a fantastic gaming experience. In this 
  second game, players will be able to immerse themselves in the world of 
  Knight Rider playing out numerous action packed missions providing hours 
  upon hours of fun. A multi-player mode will allow breathtaking split-screen 
  action between two players.
