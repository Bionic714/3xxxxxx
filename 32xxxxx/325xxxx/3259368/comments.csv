,Data-Danne,2004-11-25T21:58Z,Den här kanske borde ha hamnat under TV snarare än under Serier...
,Ykalon,2004-11-26T03:26Z,Serier = Comics. This one belongs under TV
,broken_fae,2004-12-26T10:25Z,"Somone Behaga frön den här igen?

Someone Please seed this again?"
,belyakov,2005-06-21T17:44Z,Could someone please seed? stuck @ 99.3%
,NiPPe,2005-07-19T02:31Z,"99,3% for 3 months now... "
,Loxxie13,2006-05-25T09:25Z,"Stuck @99,3% too :-(((("
,sardonic,2006-08-06T10:47Z,"52 people stuck at 99.3%

,PoizonIvy,2006-12-10T17:42Z,"I'm also stuck on 99.3%.

Anyone knows where to get this season elsewhere?"
,hnky,2007-07-01T10:49Z,"...still stuck @ 99.3%
Anyone?"
,kneesoxxx,2007-09-16T14:58Z,"ME TOO !!!
...still stuck @ 99.3%

Who's the dick with the seeds...?"
,chicana,2008-01-20T04:59Z,"stuck on 99.3 , for months.does somebody have idea what to do, because  it is obvious that there are no one who who would seed this.single episodes are almost finished,and i can play them with vlc player,and the part that is missing doesn't pose any problem except e19,which i cannot play at all.can i somehow fix that?"
,Highwaywoman,2008-01-23T16:02Z,"Oh how I wish someone would fininsh seeding this, it is so annoying to be stuck in 99.3 %!  It says that there is 1 seeder but I never got contact with him, only peers. Wonder if the seeder has this on pause."
,NorseGuy,2008-02-05T16:53Z,"Actually, people have been stuck for almost three years.
I have most the episodes and can probably make the torrent from 99,3% to 99,9 done, but nothing more. There are then still three episodes that will not be fully completed, but you can anyway watch these three episodes quite normally (only with a jump/stop where the torrents are not completed) by removing the extension that tells that they are not completed (""!ut"" on uTorrent). 
Anyway, this torrent should be rendered dead, as there exists some real quality TV rips (for instance on emule) of the seasons that are not on DVD. These better TV rips are not uploaded on PirateBay though, and as I don't have the nice rips, some other person can make the effort to put them on here.
After I have uploaded the episodes I can help you with, I'll delete what I have, so don't expect me to come back to seed later ;-)"
,NorseGuy,2008-02-05T16:58Z,PS! Damned. The hash check showed that most my so called identical episodes weren't identical anyway. It happens when the episodes have been corrupted through for instance the recirculating process like through eMule. Sorry.
,teddie_,2008-04-15T09:57Z,"can someone please seed i've been stuck on 99,3% for a month now"
,Elathrim,2008-06-10T11:54Z,"Please seed, stuck on 99,3%!"
,casanova3081,2008-11-06T07:00Z,to all you out there with the 99.3% problem ... join the club .... you say 1-3 months ... I have it on that percentage for the last almost 3 years now .... it is up on a 1:112 ration .... 
,wiwwy,2008-12-12T14:58Z,"plz for the guys who reached that 99.3 %
of course with that percentage there are some completed episodes (completely downloaded)
so plz tell me what episodes will be completed
when you reache that % and what will not ?

plz answer me, maybe i can help with the noncompleted episodes

thank you"
,SentientSoftware,2008-12-20T08:06Z,"wiwwy,
The epsiodes that are incomplete are:
2
4
6
10
12
14
16
18
19
21
23
24

19 is a problem (as previously mentioned by another user) because 1st piece is the one missing.  10, 14 and 18 are missing 2 pieces, so probably have a more noticable blip in playing.  If you have these episodes, it would be great if you can get them, get the good ones from this, and start a new torrent stream."
