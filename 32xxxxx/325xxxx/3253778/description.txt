The most wonderful surprise i have ever had watching the Marx Brothers´ films, took place while watching "A Night in Casablanca";. Almost nobody recognizes Kornblow´s client at the middle of the film. Beautiful people; we are talking about the great Marilyn Monroe. Watch it again if you were not aware, following the example of the people that wrote the credits of the film for the IMDB.
