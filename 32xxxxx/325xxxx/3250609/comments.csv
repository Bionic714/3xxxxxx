,8475647476574,2007-09-25T17:43Z,"If you are on a Mac:

(1) Download and install The Unarchiver from wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html (it is free)

(2) Upack the first single huge .rar-Archive that you downloaded through the torrent

(3) In it you find several files with these endings:

.r01, .r02, .r03 etc.
.rar
.sfv
.nfo

(4) Drag the file with the ending .rar (not .r01 etc.!) onto Unarchiver

(5) In the folder that is created, take either the .bin or the .cue file and drag it onto Toast

(6) Burn a CD

That's all."
