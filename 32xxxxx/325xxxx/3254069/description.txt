PLOT 

Set not so long ago in a distant land, the film follows the    
  adventures of twin tiger cubs--one shy and gentle, the other  
  bold and fierce--who are born among the temple ruins of an  
  exotic jungle. However, on a fateful day, the brothers are    
  separated by fate. The bold brother is sold off to a circus,  
where homesickness and living in a cage rob him of his spirit. 
Meanwhile, the shy cub becomes the beloved companion of the  
  governor's lonely young son, until an accident forces the  
family to give him away to a man who resolves to break his    
gentle nature and turn him into a fighter for sport. When they  
  are fully grown the brothers find themselves reunited -- but as 
  forced enemies, pitted against each other.
