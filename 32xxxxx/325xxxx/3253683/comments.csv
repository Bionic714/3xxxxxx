,bolle55,2004-11-23T20:52Z,jag kanske fattar trögt men hur hittar jag koden till programet .tack på förhand 
,tuxorrent,2004-11-29T12:17Z,"Det fungerar inte :(  Installer hangs always on 99% done when a message window pops up and dislpays that 'setting up system...' or something. If I kill the installer, wavelab is installed but no shortcuts are made and if it's started from its install folder, it asks for serial. Any suggestions?


"
,tuxorrent,2004-11-29T15:22Z,"Nevermind my previous comment. It works now, the installer did not hang, I just needed to wait a couple of minutes longer then it finished normally.  "

,Fishrobber,2007-07-28T00:25Z,"Managed to get this to work on one PC and I can certify it as being virus free. However, the installer was a piece of shit. It hung for a long time on one PC and did not finish at all on the other. The stupid installer music also got on my nerves - it continued playing untill I rebooted."
