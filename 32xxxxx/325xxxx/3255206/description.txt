Here is few new Jay-Z / Linkin Park tracks. Thise
are better than i thought they would be. Enjoy !!
Thise tracks are ripped from Collision Course PROMO
CDR, THEY ALL ARE CLEAN LIVE VERSIONS :/
I really dont know anything else about this CD,
except it was on my office`s desktop when i arrived
at work. Quality is quite sucky, but thats how its
on the cd.
