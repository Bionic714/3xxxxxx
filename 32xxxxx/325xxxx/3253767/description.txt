KARTVADER is the FIRST
of the NEXT GENERATION
of EXTREME VIDEOS.

42 miles or 67.8km of public roads have
been ripped in one shot. Highways, streets,
parks, tunnels in 3 different cities have been
shred and drifted. The cops were confused
about what was going on and where trying to
catch our driver. But we were still able to
pull out this video. Everything you see is how
it was at FULL throttle with bumps and slides
on the streets and highways without music...
just pure two stroke engine sound.
