,muddy,2004-11-21T14:25Z,"tveta:
Check your shortcut and add "" -steam"" at the end of the command line, like:
..directory..hl2.exe -steam
[don't forget the space before -steam]
Did that help you out?"
,alphabr,2004-11-21T20:12Z," try download my release. Dont need anything. 
 Only install and play.
take a look of the install: ftp://139.82.24.148/inst.JPG

  If you download my patch , just extract to your halflife2 folder overwriting the files and execute the halflife2.bat

,NikErgo,2006-02-01T20:20Z,"HEY!!! I played it for a couple of hours and saved. Exited, went to work, came back home, loaded a saved game and it said ""A.I. disabled""! WHY? I don't want to play a game where the A.I. doesn't work?!? WTF, man?"
,grimme,2006-02-19T12:31Z,"Its a classic problem, almost all releases cope with it. I don't know the solution anymore but I'm sure I allready saw one, try scouting the comments of other HL2 releases."
