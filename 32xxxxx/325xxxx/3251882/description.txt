Just like most Van Morrison albums, you can put "Days like this" on and just play it straight through and enjoy. I consider Van to be one of the best songwriter's of our time and he proves it again with this album and there isn't really one true commmercial hit on this album, which is unique. The title track along with others are enjoyable but other tracks like "Underlying depression" and "Ancient Highway" are truly touching and emotional. I would recommend it to any old or new Van Morrison fan. I rate it as one of my favorite Van albums of all time.
