In season two of 24, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) and his daughter, Kim (Elisha Cuthbert), dealt with the trauma of his wife/her mother’s murder, and the effect it had on their relationship. Jack, who had been inactive since his wife’s death more than a year earlier, was called upon by now-President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) to stop a terrorist plot to detonate a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles. While Jack and his team were able to save Los Angeles from the attack, President Palmer’s fate is uncertain entering season three, as he was exposed to a potentially lethal toxin via a poisonous handshake after a press conference.

Season three, which is set three years later, finds Jack, who has just spent several months deep under cover, returning to the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) as Director of Field Operations. The mystery of President Palmer’s fate and its aftershocks will be revealed.

The series also features Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) now the Los Angeles Director of CTU, and Michelle Dessler (Reiko Aylesworth), his chief confidante in the organisation and introduces Chase Edmunds (James Badge Dale), a young CTU agent who suddenly finds himself not only looking up to Jack, but working alongside him as well.
