Seems like a fun movie, by watching the trailer at Apple.com anyway.

  ±    Andrew Largeman shuffled through life in a lithium-induced coma 
       until his mother's death inspired a vacation from the pills to see 
       what might happen. A moderately successful TV actor living in Los 
       Angeles, "Large" hasn't been home to the Garden State in nine years. 
       But even with 3,000 miles between them, he's been unable to escape 
       his domineering father Gideon and the silencing effect he's had on 
       his son from afar. Stunned to find himself in his hometown after 
       such a long absence, Large finds old acquaintances around every 
       corner living quite unique lives as gravediggers, fast food knights 
       and the panderers of pyramid schemes. Meanwhile, at home, he does 
       his best to avoid a long-simmering but inevitable confrontation with 
       his father. By a twist of fate, Large meets Sam, a girl who is 
       everything he isn't. A blast of color, hope and quirks, Sam becomes 
       a sidekick who refuses to ride in his sidecar. Her warmth and 
       fearlessness give Large the courage to open his heart to the joy and 
       pain of the infinite abyss that is life.                         ±
