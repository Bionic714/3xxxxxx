It requires a cd-key, it is included in the torrent.

windowsupdate says it's not a genuine windows installation though."

,LordOrwell,2009-05-29T23:26Z,yes.  adblock plus will block them.  It's the best plugin i've ever used.  Sometimes you have to unblock it to let certain flash videos play but other than that it's great.
