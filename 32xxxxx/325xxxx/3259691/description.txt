At night and on weekends four men in a suburban garage have built a
cottage industry of error-checking devices. But they know that there is
something more. There is some idea some mechanism some accidental side
effect that is standing between them and a pure leap of innovation. And
so through trial and error they are building the device that is missing
most. However two of these men find the device and immediately realize
that it is too valuable to market. The limit of their trust in each other
is strained when they are faced with the question If you always want what
you cant have what do you want when you can have anything
