,Mario1470,2005-07-06T09:43Z,"Enya Trivia: This was the only Album that featured a black and white cover (a picture of Enya next to a German Shepherd, I think). It was later re-released with new cover art (much better looking, which fit the style of her other albums). 

One of the pieces from this album was used in the Movie ""L.A. Story"" in addition to ""Exile"", one of her best songs ever.

One last trivia tidbit...the 1988 printing of ""Shepherd Moons has the original version of ""Book of Days"", not the mutilated english version on the 1989 re-print."
