,carlap,2006-02-15T16:20Z,"Hey, can someone tell me how to install this?  there's no bin/cue file even though the comments say its bin/cue.  No iso.  Help!!!"
,LhoRkaN,2006-03-02T00:40Z,"Yeah, same problem here!
there are some unreadable files, and surely no bin/cue files..."
,jim_mccann,2006-11-20T10:31Z,"seems like this is a .rar-archive, but where is the main file? damn!"
,jim_mccann,2006-11-20T10:51Z,"Allright, I'll do you a favor today ;-)
Just open the file ""pntc4di3.001"" with winrar and you shouls be able to extract the .cue and .bin file. Enjoy!"
,MrMansson,2007-10-07T21:03Z,"No, sorry.

I can only agree that these .00x archives are sub par. If you want to use rar, then why not an archive that has the .rar file at the end so that users with 7z for instance, can extract it without having to download winrar?

winrar was King around 1989, but the world has moved forward since.

The Maxon releases are the only reason I now get stuck with winrar on my disk.

-------

Apart from that. Let me say that a small issue that like doesn't take anyting from the fact that overall, this is an excellent release.

THANKS."
,nattdog,2009-10-09T02:35Z,"yep do as jim_mccann suggests works great!!!
Awesome upload btw thx very much. Would have been a little easier for people to understand if it had the .rar extension for noobs. but yeah im not complaining. To those who are complaining about rars tho must not torrent very often as 90% of all compressed torrents are either rar or iso. enjoy!!!"
