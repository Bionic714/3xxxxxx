OK here's The Avengers on Target Video from 1978, this isn't a perfect copy but its the best i have come across in years of trading. I cleaned it up as best as i could and the sound is fine, its still great and is a must, i also included Wild Women Of Punk from pogo video featuring Karen Black/Fur/Wives/Sisters Grimm, enjoy!

Avengers-Target Video 1978 SVCD 30 minutes
Wild Women Of Punk SVCD 22 minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
