,jasminko,2004-10-31T11:14Z,Actually they are Bosnian but the differences are minimal anyway.
,modul,2004-10-31T16:24Z,"One member of the group was Goran Bregovic, before he became famous for his music to films by Emir Kusturica and others."
,Jeff,2004-10-31T21:13Z,"Thanks alot man! I really love old Yugoslavian music. If you have anymore of this, especially anything from Goran (Who just happen to be the king) then I would love you to death if you could upload it. 
Or someone might even have some Emir Kusturica movies to upload?"
,petersven,2004-11-01T07:41Z,"Can U be a bit more specific regarding Your request for YU music. I have  rock, pop, folk and more. Group name or singer is a good hint. From Goran its all I have in the bundle Bijelo Dugme. Sorry! "
,Jeff,2004-11-03T18:51Z,"i am actually interested in most yugoslavian music. but perhaps mainly the balkan brass-kinda music. I have a serbian female friend and a bosnian female friend which both tend to throw yuggomusic at me. 
If you wuld have any swedish yuggomusic I would really apreciate that too. like Den flygande Bokrullen or Ăstblocket.
But as I said: Goran is the king. Boban Markovic Orkestar and simmilar bands are really good partystarters. Play the soundtrack for ""Chat Noir, Chat Blanc""/""Svart Katt, Vit Katt""/""Black Cat, White Cat"" and I can guarantee you a great party! 
Thansk again!"
,petersven,2004-11-04T07:50Z,"Jeff,

I don't have the swedish-yugo music You requested. Regarding the original yugo music, can You please give me som group / singer names?

Peace"
,Jeff,2004-11-04T08:12Z,"As I said: Im really a novice in this area, so I munch on practically anything that I can get my hands on, but If you would have anymore folk/big brass-music like just Boban Markovic, Goran and such it would be wonderful if you could upload that.
Other than that: I am just grateful that you even upload anything, so whatever you might have is interesting."
,petersven,2004-11-04T15:18Z,"Ok!

This is what I have:

,Helldiver,2005-07-12T16:47Z,"Actually they are Yougoslave and if we want to dig deeper we could call them Bosnian but definitly not Serbian. Sorry but some correction have to be made. To be Just with History.  

In any case great upload. Hope that we get more old Yougo rock.  Thanks again."
