AMG Review:
Al Green reached his creative peak with the brilliant Call Me, 
the most inventive and assured album of his career. So silky 
and fluid as to sound almost effortless, Green's vocals revel 
in the lush strings and evocative horns of Willie Mitchell's 
superbly intimate production, barely rising above an angelic 
whisper for the gossamer "Have You Been Making Out O.K.."
 With barely perceptible changes in mood, Call Me covers 
remarkable ground, spanning from "Stand Up" -- a call to 
arms delivered with characteristic understatement -- to 
renditions of Hank Williams' "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" 
and Willie Nelson's "Funny How Time Slips Away," both of 
them exemplary fusions of country and soul. Equally 
compelling are the album's three Top Ten hits -- "You Ought 
to Be With Me," "Here I Am (Come and Take Me)," and the 
shimmering title cut. A classic.

enjoy and seed :)
