What it does?
It's like a Rescue CD/Installer for modded xboxes, it's a bootable CD
with Evolution-X Dashboard installed and some applications/tools that
I find usefull, you can see what applications are in the CD bellow.
It allso allows you to format the harddrive in the xbox, this is
usefull if you've put in a new HDD into the xbox or just want to
clear out the old disk. So you can install the CD into
the harddrive which is recommended.


here is the list of what tools are included:
MS Dashboard 4920 (Original Dashboard)
EvolutionX Dashboard Build 3935 (Evox Dashboard)
Evox M8 Bios for versions (1.0-1.5) (support for big HDD's)

In short, what this is good for?

If you have changed your hdd in the xbox to a new empty one and want to format it.
If you accidently run ms xbox dash update for live and only can see ms dashboard.
