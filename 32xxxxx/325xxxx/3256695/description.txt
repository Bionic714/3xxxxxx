In the year 2029, the barriers of our world have been broken down by the net and by cybernetics, 
but this brings new vulnerability to humans in the form of brain-hacking. When a highly-wanted hacker 
known as 'The Puppetmaster' begins involving them in politics, Section 9, a group of cybernetically 
enhanced cops, are called in to investigate and stop the Puppetmaster. The pursuit will call into question 
what makes a human and what is the Puppetmaster in a world where the distinction between human and 
machine is increasingly blurry.
