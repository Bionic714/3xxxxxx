20 tracks from his ten first years:
you never even called me by my name
please come to Boston
Jody like a melody
long haired redneck
Willie, Waylon and me
Take this job and shove it
just prove my love for you
Jack Daniels if you please
would you lay with me
divers do it deeper
x´s and o´s
this bottle in my hand
get a little dirt on your hands
stand by your man
tennessee whiskey
now i lay me down to cheat
what made you change your mind
the ride
Mona-Lisa lost her smile
