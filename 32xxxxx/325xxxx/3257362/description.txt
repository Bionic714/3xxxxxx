...Humorously addressing the ambiguity of his upcoming major label full-length project 
with Atlantic Records, Demigodz co-founder Apathy follows up his best-selling double 
disc compilation & "It's The Bootleg Muthaf**kas Vol. 1" with 22 brand new recordings 
featuring guest appearances from Styles of Beyond, Celph Titled, Majik Most, Eternia 
and others, plus beats provided by Kanye West, DJ Khalil (Self Scientific), 8th, 
Cyrus Tha Great and Chum The Skrilla Guerilla! "Where's Your Album" contains both 
original produced songs as well as exclusive freestyles over beats like Nas "Represent", 
Jeru The Damaja "Da Bichez" and even White Stripes "Seven Nation Army"...
