I mean, common.. You do know what ""description"" means?

FFS, place some fucking small description on what type of movie it is, storyline and other important stuff. Keep in mind that this is a SWEDISH torrent site, and spanish does not count in as a navive language here.


To put it simple:
English or Swedish spoken movies are offcource accepted, but PLEASE comment if it is in a different language.

[V],catflap,2004-11-18T16:34Z,"you should also put the language name as part of the torrent title, then there'll be no mistake. :)"
[V],catflap,2004-11-18T16:40Z,"forgot to say:

i don't think this tracker is limited to english and swedish. it's just proper to give all the correct info in the torrent and the description.

also pctorrent - it doesn't make musc sense posting your stuff here and inviting people to come to your site, because when you upload a torrent here, you can only use the piratebay tracker - it doesn't accept other trackers, as far as i know.

so you'll do better by putting your stuff on your own tracker and posting it to suprnova and lokitorrent, which accepts all trackers. :)"
