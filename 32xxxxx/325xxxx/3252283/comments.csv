,TLD,2007-02-10T12:34Z,Cracket funkar ju inte alls! ..hjälp mig!!
,Kickedinthehead,2007-03-03T18:29Z,"I actually got this to run. Follow the instructions in the ripcd.txt in the file no-cdcrack.zip.

Copy the files...

CD1:
maps01.mix
multi.mix
sidecd01.mix
sizzle1.vqa

CD2:
maps02.mix
sidecd02.mix

To your game directory.

Then run the patch file.
You will get the ""Missing or invalid registry/ini entry."" error just hit ok.


Let it run. Select your game.exe file when it pops up and it will patch just fine.

I then ran the crack executable and everything went smoothly.

Running it under windows 2000 running just fine."
,elvz,2007-03-26T19:31Z,"hmm, något som jag gör fel... 

jag har kopierat filerna till setup mappen där filen ""game"" finns.. 

sen så har jag patchat upp game filen med den senaste patchen... 

efter det så försökte jag cracka nya game filen men då får jag bara ""failed""

vad har jag missat,, skulle vara bussigt om nån har svar..."
,Grundpro,2007-04-01T12:00Z,"Vart samma sak för mig ""elvs"" så jag hämta ett annat crack. Nu startar spelet men jag kan inte ladda ngt scenario

,<JesC>,2007-06-27T17:38Z,"Cant get this work :(
When i try to start it, it says something about missing .DLL files ... 
I've done what that ripcd file says... HELP! please"
,<JesC>,2007-06-27T17:41Z,Might it be that i use Windows Vista???
,Tcip,2007-10-13T16:21Z,Use Magic Iso Maker (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3776400) to extract the files. Or use DAEMON Tools (http://www.daemon-tools.cc) to emulate it. And u don't need to burn or extact the files
,LillJocke,2007-12-15T11:51Z,jag får det inte att funka för det är en .DLL fil som saknas eller är skadad säger vista-helvetet...
,ahli,2007-12-28T14:07Z,"kanon funkar perfekt 
installera ts1 först  sedan patchen och avsluta med cracken 
så funkar det "
,UnLucky13,2008-02-03T09:08Z,"Hunga, Help Us!!! How do we can get the patch?!?!?!?! "
,UnLucky13,2008-02-03T09:30Z,Could someone tell me what is the name of DLL file?
,nantokanaru,2008-02-08T19:54Z,"For you Vista users out there:
1. Run the game (and probably the patch as well) as administrators, and run in Windows 98 compatibility mode. (Right-click on the file in question, choose Properties, Compatibility etc)
2. When the patch complains just press OK and then WAIT. After a few minutes or so the patch will give up and display a pop-up box where it asks you to enter a file. Navigate to the directory where you installed the game, and choose the GAME.EXE file. The patch will now be applied without problems.
3. When the patch has been applied, follow the instructions in the text file inside of the No-CD crack compressed file."
,Kvade,2008-02-12T11:08Z,how do you copy the text into the files?
,nantokanaru,2008-02-14T21:07Z,"@Kvade
What do you mean...?"
,DooDyBaby,2008-02-22T11:26Z,"This is annoying, I'm doing what people say I should do, but when I try and patch it, and I click ok, the patch window stops responding. Any idea what to do?"
,DooDyBaby,2008-02-22T13:54Z,"Also, where is the ""missing or invalid registry/INI""?"
,bosabengt,2008-03-03T20:40Z,"använd först senaste patchen 2.03!!!! jag fick vänta ett tag. en ruta kommer upp. välj cd1 eller om det var cd2
Sen no cd cracken!

spelar det nu! / Anders"
,astroview120mm,2008-05-11T09:45Z,how do i play online?
,darkbehemoth0,2008-06-12T21:10Z,"Patcher and Cd-Cracker, do not work. Patcher is missing plugins/INI files and the Cd-Cracker fails.

Don't waste your time."
,darkbehemoth0,2008-06-19T06:20Z,"Let's see, after giving into my craving of TS. I re-downloaded. After I installed, patched and attempted to crack the game, everything seemed fine except after running the game. ""Failed to Initialize."" It said to reinstall, I did and everything was undone. I installed it again, and this time only ran the patcher. I didnt touch the CD-Crack, ran the game and poof! it worked. I suggest trying the same thing people. Also, for those of you using Hamachi, join my network, ""BehemothGames"". I've been looking into getting a gaming network going. If your interested, join and message me. Thanks and enjoy TS."
,darkbehemoth0,2008-06-19T06:21Z,"Ill repeat, join ""BehemothGames"", the password is ""kickass"". See you round."
,rc2x,2008-07-11T20:37Z,"How to use the trainer?
I've copy that trainer small file to directory and when i run it it said that the trainer has stop working!
Please tell me step by step to use that trainer!"
,Wormicle,2008-08-10T03:23Z,"Got the game to work fine, just couldn't load the second mission for either side. It'd just say ""couldn't initialize map"" or some such and then reload mssion one.
Never mind, it's cool, didn't like this one much anyway. I have Generals ;)"
,bifoy,2008-08-14T13:14Z,snälla seeda för *** för det tar ganska lång tid. jag vill så gärna ha detta spelet =P
,CarlMemphis,2008-08-14T19:45Z,"I've managed to patch it, and crack it, and it should be working... but only minutes into the first mission the game crashes. Epic fail on this torrent, here's my advice:

Go and purchase a platinum release, this game has been around for 9 or so years now, so you should be looking at a bargain.

Also, this game is fun online ( if you can get a severver running, that is... )"
,Wormicle,2008-08-19T21:36Z,"Seriously. Your advice, to people who use a piracy website, is to BUY the game?
Good one, I needed a laugh."
,russallen,2008-09-16T01:01Z,"I don't understand. I'm trying to install this game, but everytime I run the installation, it tells me: ""Please Insert CD-ROM disc"", and it shuts down.

What's happening?!"
,Metalliman,2008-11-20T16:59Z,"Great torrent, great game, works fine. Thanx hunga and all the seeders :D"
,pussuw,2008-11-28T12:08Z,.nrg format is destined for fail. Will download this but am a bit sceptical after reading other user comments. Hope this works. 
,Frostyy,2009-01-08T17:18Z,"Kör inget no cd crack, bara patch 2.03 sedan går det bra att spela efter man kört SUN.EXE."
,johnnybigoode,2009-03-17T01:19Z,"works great under xp, just make sure that EVERYTHING including the patch, is running in compatibility mode with win95"
,5iF3R,2009-03-25T22:38Z,"nice1 hunga tnx! 

:P"
,the_tommy_87,2009-08-28T17:53Z,"This game works fine except for the LAN, which is the main reason why I downloaded it ... Anyone know why, or how to get it to work? Thanks ..."
