,CarlMemphis,2006-11-19T18:18Z,"Oh and btw, ROKKIS, you're off at the wrong end if it all. First, you download, install and make shure you learn how to use Reason. [This is not something you do by reading the manual, believe me, Cuz I never did.] Then, when you're running out of idĂŠas (hard to imagine a rookie having any need of refills with a program as advanced as reason, but there's always an IF) it's time to expand your sound bank with some fresh tunes from a refill such as this.
If you learn how to control the NN-XT properly, THIS WILL BLOW YOUR MIND"
