Release Notes 
:: 
This is a rare and out of print Eminem debut titled "Infinite".This is 
the official licensed import digipack. This album was re-released during 
2003 in Central Europe with bonus rare studio tracks and freestyles 
added onto the original release. There's only 23 tracks, not 25 like the 
back of the inlay insert says. It's a misprint.
