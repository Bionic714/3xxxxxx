I'm the only seeder now. My ratio is 4.5 and see no other seeders. It's a shame that other people devote their time, electricity and seed and other just hit and run!"
,The Punisher CRO,2006-11-01T19:05Z,"too slow download !
only 3 kB/s !"
,EspN_,2007-02-25T18:50Z,Seed someone?
,Sobbsy,2007-03-05T06:55Z,"Heh, 6kb/s, this could take a while.

Hopefully someone's going to come along and see people are still trying to grab this, and seed. Unlikely, but one can hope...

Was trying to find my copy of this game last night, seems it's the only game that I absolutely can't find."
,Sobbsy,2007-03-06T04:12Z,"Allright well i've almost finished getting this, at about 80% right now. Once i'm done i'll have about 25kb/s of upload bandwidth to give out...not much, but every little bit helps."
