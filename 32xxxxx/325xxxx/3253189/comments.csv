,hamblu,2005-08-15T07:40Z,"im loading it now too, no complete copies are online now, but that doesnt matter, theyll come on.
i would seed it even if i got 100% but most ppl dont do it, so that 99,7% is necessary i think...

greeez"
,Pift,2006-06-30T07:02Z,"SOMEONE PLEASE SEED. IM' AT 99.8%!!!
PLEASE!"
,Nanukfromthenorth,2006-12-02T09:55Z,seed plz even if you only have 98%
,hermaeusmora,2007-08-16T18:21Z,which files are missing at the last 0.3% ???
,Rockstar888,2008-03-04T18:59Z,"no sean idiotas!!! dont be idiots!! you can move the carpets of the albums, but 1st see which one r missing, just get into the carpets nd if a song is missing must not say the artist nd all of that, coz, when u have downloaded wizo songs, all of them r edited so look for the song wich r missing with limewire ares etc!! i think .3% must be like 4 or 5 songs as much!! then edit them wiht itunes dn thats all!!!"
,Rockstar888,2008-03-04T19:03Z,"hey morons!! is missing just one song ""jupp (mit jochen)"" dont be dramatic!!!"
,Meph33,2008-06-30T15:54Z,"Please Seed! I'm stuck at 99.7%.
Thanx!"
,demonrobuk,2008-09-07T23:31Z,"Any chance of some seeder/s please? Stuck at 99.8% as many others seem to be - if someone were to seed it for a day (and tbh - how much of your computers resources will it use up doing that?!!?!) we could all finish our downloads and enjoy this great band! 
Thanks!"
,radflat,2008-10-23T20:47Z,"come on please seed im stuck at 99.8 just like everyone else.come on i need this shit bad.

Thanks"
,antiaverage,2009-01-26T19:27Z,"I too am stuck at 99.8%, but the only songs which didn't complete are two live bootlegs and a song from an incomplete demo.  All the full albums complete.  I will keep seeding this 99.8%, but it's really no big deal that it doesn't reach 100%."
,antiaverage,2009-01-26T19:30Z,"I forgot to be specific.  The songs which don't finish are the following...

Two from ""2002 - 26.01. Berlin, Kvu""
Jupp (mit Jochen)
Hoppla

One from ""Demo - incomplete""
Maedchen, Nein Danke"
