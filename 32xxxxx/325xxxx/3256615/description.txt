ZoneAlarm's Security Suite is one of the best security suites we've seen. Its interface is far easier to use and understand than the competition's, and its feature set, which includes a personal information vault and IM message encryption, puts the comparably priced Norton Internet Security 2004 and McAfee Internet Security 6.0 to shame. While there are still some areas (namely spam filtering) that we'd like to see ZoneAlarm beef up in later versions, overall, ZoneAlarm Security Suite is the suite to beat for all-around Internet privacy and security, whether you use your PC from home or take the corporate laptop out on the road.
