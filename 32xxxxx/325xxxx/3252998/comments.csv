,Kaikaine,2009-02-01T05:52Z,Noone has a complete copy who's seeding so there's no point in downloading this.
,Kaikaine,2009-03-14T03:42Z,Even though noone has a complete copy once you get 99.9% the game is playable though it is a PAL version but ps2_pal2ntsc_yfix works PERFECTLY. Also converting the nrg to iso is pretty easy with MagicIso
