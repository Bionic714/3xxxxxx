,fujiwara,2004-10-29T07:58Z,"can anyone explain to me why this movie has such a high rating at imdb.com ? I've tried to watch the DVDScreener a couple of weeks ago. It was awful, I had to trash it after 5 mins. "
,Grime,2004-10-30T15:46Z,"How the hell can you comment and judge a movie, you've only watched 5 minutes of? That's just stupid. See the whole movie, before you come here with your stupid comments."
,Rangrang,2004-10-30T23:22Z,I loved the first movie. Really good romantic movie. So I'll check this one out too.
,iados,2004-12-29T14:40Z,Thanks for the file and  to all who continue to seed.
,BiZaA,2005-01-02T18:21Z,"How do I use the ""before.sunset.dvdrip.xvid-deity.idx"" and ""before.sunset.dvdrip.xvid-deity.sub"" files? Do I need a special program??"

Peace! Babe"
,Aarghmatey,2007-04-01T10:51Z,I hope this works.  I actually saw Julie Delphy at the Nina Simone concert that she talks about in the movie.  I almost said hi but I didn't.  I'm finally getting around to seeing this movie.
,allmypeople,2007-04-09T20:03Z,Nice to see movies with brains uploaded here. I'll definitely seed for a while
,Dr.Esam,2007-06-25T21:11Z,"Thank you very much it has been a long time since I've enjoyed a descent sophisticated movie experience, and finally completing my richer lincklater collection"
,jaysthetics,2007-10-10T09:03Z,"for anyone who wants to see what i would call a very good companion film for ""before sunset"", should really check out ""lovers of the arctic circle"", it'll blow you away."
,GreenDorkness,2007-12-20T22:29Z,"Downloading now, but the original 'Before Sunrise' is a sparkling gem of a movie in the romance genre. 

To fuji: I guess films can't cater to everyone. If Before Sunset is anything like the movie which preceded it, I'd say it would appeal who wants to see a genuine picture of what it is to truly connect with another's personality, of what it means to fall in love with intellectually and emotionally as well as physically."
,kukahuve,2009-08-10T09:00Z,Great movie. Thanks! Also very cool it's been seeded for 5 years...
