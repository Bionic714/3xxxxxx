,slobodan243,2006-01-04T16:31Z,Hey can someone please seed this? Been looking for this on CD for 5 years (I dont live in Swe anylonger - I tell you it is hard to find elsewhere) PLEASE?
,slobodan243,2006-01-22T17:47Z,Downloaded 259 times yet I have been stuck on the remarkable 86.7% now for 2 weeks...can anyone please seed this?
,slobodan243,2006-02-22T10:29Z,It would be awfully nice if someone could seed this for a wee moment. I am at a cool 97.1% and I ain't going nowhere. I know this bloody torrent is 2 years old but hey! In any case it would be really fucking cool if somone could make a new post/torrent with this record....Please etc
