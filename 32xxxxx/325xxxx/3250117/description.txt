OK here's a Siouxsie And The Banshees double treat for everyone, first up is Rockpalast in 1981 and then Rock Goes To College from 1981, both these are taken from oringinal SVHS tapes i recorded my self when they were reshown so they are HQ, enjoy!

Siouxsie And The Banshees-Rockpalast KÃ¶ln Germany 19 July 1981 SVCD 75 minutes
Siouxsie And The Banshees-Rock Goes To College 1981 SVCD 40 minutes

These are in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and they will play in most DVD players. They will fit on 2 80min blank cd-r using nero.
