Its feeding time This enjoyable schlock centers on an allAmerican 
middleaged couple the Davies John P. Ryan and Sharon Farrell who 
want to have one more child in addition to their 11yearold son. When 
the big day arrives however the Davies baby turns out to be a 
mutated monster that kills when its scared ... which is pretty much 
all the time. Think Rosemarys Baby but more graphically gruesome 
and funny.
