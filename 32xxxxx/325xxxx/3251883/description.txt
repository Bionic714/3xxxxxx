This is a gem, among gems. Knowing the immense notoriety this performance has gained, it's funny to think EC originally didn't want to release it, because he thought that his fans would not take to it. He said that he always enjoyed playing these classic, blues numbers on his acoustic guitars at home, but never realized that other people would find them of interest. Well, being that this is probably, the most popular 'Unplugged' performance from the series, I guess he was wrong.
