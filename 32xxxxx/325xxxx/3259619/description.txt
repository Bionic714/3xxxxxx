Make your self a cup of coffee, pour yourself a glass of single malt (I suggest Bowmore, 15 years) and add some pieces of bitter chocolate (72% cocoa). The film is straight forward, no questions asked – no answers given. Just relax and enjoy it (and the beverage). 
Oh, I’m sorry – one question arose during the watching – what is Fabian doing - and why?
