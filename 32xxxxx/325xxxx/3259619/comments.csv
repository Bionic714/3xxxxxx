May I also suggest a 15 year Laphroaig as an alternative single malt. ;)"
,Renaldo,2004-11-27T21:50Z,"This looks like a 5-star release to me, cloudberry, but I'll refrain from rating it until I have it, which will be another 10 hours from now. I wouldn't pay jerks who rate something they haven't even gotten yet any mind."
,Renaldo,2004-11-28T11:00Z,"I've burned it to a DVD now, and it looks great! Thanks for this one! I'll seed 200%, that's about all I can manage on a 0.5Mbit line."
