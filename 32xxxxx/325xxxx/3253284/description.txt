The world of warcraft open beta installer, the link to this file was leaked on the Battle.net forums, but i was fast enough to dl it :)
This is Blizzards own bittorrent klient which auto dl world of warcraft, so dont worry about the size, its not fake. You will however need a wow key, but its open beta next week(notice: American open beta, it will be hard for europeans to sign up, but good luck).
Ps. this is my first upload, comments are welcome :).
