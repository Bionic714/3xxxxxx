    RELEASE NOTES:                                                      
                                                                          
                                                                          
    In terms of sales and lasting popularity, Elton John was the        
    biggest pop superstar of the early '70s. Initially marketed as a    
    singer/songwriter, John soon revealed he could craft Beatlesque      
    pop and pound out rockers with equal aplomb. He could dip into      
    soul, disco and country, as well as classic pop balladry and        
    even progressive rock. His versatility, combined with his            
    effortless melodic skills, dynamic charisma and flamboyant stage  
    shows made him the most popular recording artist of the '70s.        
    Unlike many pop stars, John was able to sustain his popularity,      
    charting a Top 40 single every single year from 1970 to 1996.      
    During that time, he had temporary slumps in creativity and          
    sales, as he fell out of favor with critics, had fights with his    
    lyricist Bernie Taupin, and battled various addictions and          
    public scandals. But through it all, John remained a remarkably      
    popular artist and many of his songs - including "Your Song,"        
    "Rocket Man," "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road," and "Don't Let the        
    Sun Go Down On Me" - became contemporary pop standards. This is      
    his latest record, Peachtree Road.
