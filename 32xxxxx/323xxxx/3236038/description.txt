   Description:

   Burnout 3 rewrites the rules of the road with a new mantra: 
   aggressive racing required. Racing gamers and adrenaline
   junkies are invited to get behind the wheel and experience 
   unprecedented speed and action. Use your car as a weapon and
   battle your way to the front of the pack by taking down rivals
   and instigating spectacular crashes. Live dangerously with a 
   Crash mode featuring 45 segments, each of which rewards you
   for creating the most massive pileups ever seen. Vie for first 
   place with aggressive driving or simply indulge your thirst for
   twisted metal and breathtaking crashes. With stunning 3D 
   graphics, addictive multiplayer races, and over 70 cars and 40 
   tracks, Burnout 3 is a breakneck, adrenaline-fuelled, 
   arcade-racing experience.
