	One Love, a remastered retrospective of poli-spiritual musical icon Bob Marley's major-label work completed before his 1980 death from cancer, may well replace 1984's Legend as the best-selling reggae album of all time. One Love is 20 cuts to Legend's 16, a set that plays in chronological order of release as opposed to party mix. As with the latter, One Love presents the sweet organ-driven and feedback-scarred live version of "No Woman, No Cry" as well as album versions of classics like "I Shot the Sheriff," "Get Up, Stand Up," and "Jamming." Single versions of "Buffalo Soldier" and "Exodus" sidle up to the full-band cut of "Redemption Song" and the soulful Marley/Curtis Mayfield medley, "One Love/People Get Ready." A fine sampler of the Tuff Gong years from 1972's Catch a Fire and onward, One Love is aimed at the casual Marley fan rather than the hardcore completist, though its final track is indeed a rarity: the Marley-penned, Lee "Scratch" Perry-produced "I Know a Place." A moving ballad-styled anthem of solidarity and freedom, it was recorded in 1977 and is unavailable on any other Bob Marley & the Wailers album. One Love gives clear evidence of why Marley's legacy endears and endures nearly a generation after his passing. (www.amazon.com)
