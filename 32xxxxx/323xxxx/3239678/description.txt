PLOT SUMMARY

The story of 'Troy', of course, really starts when Paris,
a Trojan prince (Orlando Bloom),  steals away with Helen,
Queen of Sparta  (Diane Kruger), and in doing so,  raises
the hackles  of her  husband,  Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson)
and his  brother Agamemnon,  a  power hungry king  (Brian
Cox). And so the thousand ships are launched  and all the
kingdoms of Greece  go to war against Troy,  a city ruled
by the god-fearing King Priam (Peter O'Toole),  father of
both Paris and the great warrior Hector (Eric Bana)...
