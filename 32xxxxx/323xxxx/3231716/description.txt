Fast Bikes Show 1 
The Fast Bikes Show Crew are the most feared and revered team of testers the world over! Watch in awe as they show you the wildest wheelies, dynamite donuts, knee-down sliding and flat-out action that you’ll ever see on a selection of the world’s top superbikes. From Calais to Cannes, on road and track, these guys know how to let it all hang out – and in this film they’re hanging it out just for you. Watch the Bimota SB6, Ducati 916 and 996, Honda Fireblade and Suzuki GSXR750, Kawasaki ZXR750 and ZX9R and Triumph T595 being trashed to within an inch of their lives in this high speed biking lunacy.
