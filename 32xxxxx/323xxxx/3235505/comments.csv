,ful_fisk,2007-03-22T14:57Z,"The torrent isn't a fake. This collection is being sold by russian MP3 sites as CdM 11 to add to the confusion. Or rather: 'cafe del mar - best of chillout & Sunset music from Ibiza vol 11'

There are more attempts to hijack this brand name, London Cafe Del Mar - London for example."
