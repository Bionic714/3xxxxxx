    College is tough for Larry - he's basically a pathetic loser who 
    occasionally gets out and hits on chicks, but things always go horribly
    wrong. When a reality TV dating show comes to campus, Larry decides 
    he’s going to revitalize his life by winning the contest and proving 
    once and for all that he can live up to the shining example set by his
    Old Uncle Larry.

    Follow Larry's hilarious exploits and misadventures in the wackiest 
    college story ever. Updated for the 21st century with 3D graphics, 
    engaging real-time conversations, and a fully realized college campus,
    Larry is back to give gamers some lovin'.
    
   <--( Group Notes )--------------------------------------------- ----- -->   

    This release is declared as internal one, since we didn´t get this nice
    game working from HD! And to all this nukers out there : Yes, this is
    no retail version - since it is one month pre store, but it is no beta!
    The game is done, but the publisher decided that it is too HOT. ;)
    So some scene will be censored ... here you can enjoy the uncut version!
    We played it nearly to the end ... it is amusing. :)
