In order to be sure that a deleted file really is deleted, gone for good,
its contents never to be seen again, it is necessary to 
overwrite the data sectors of that file. 
<P>
This is what Data Destroyer does. 
It purges data in files, where "purge" means to destroy, 
to eliminate completely by overwriting, 
so that the data cannot be recovered by any means. 
<P>
Data Destroyer allows you to destroy the contents 
of a file by overwriting it several times (or many times) 
with random bytes, and with bytes with alternating bit patterns, 
before the file is deleted (i.e., unlinked). 
<P>
Why might you want to do this? For example, 
if you upgrade your PC, or your PC's hard disk, 
what about all the files on it 
(including your personal financial records? 
<P>
Donate it to charity and who knows who will end up reading 
about your offshore bank accounts? "Sanitizing" 
(as those Pentagon generals say) 
your hard disk before throwing it out or giving a 
it away is certainly advisable. 
<P>
As another example, suppose during your lunch hour at work you're 
surfing the web and you (accidentally, of course) 
stumble upon some porno site. 
By the time you realize what has happened, 
and click the Back button, 
your browser has already saved maybe several 
GIFs of naked women 
(or worse, naked men, boys or prepubescent girls) 
to your hard disk. 
<P>
Oops! Maybe no-one will ever find them. 
But to be sure you could run Data Destroyer on all 
the images in your browser's 
cache folder, before deleting them. That way you can be sure 
no-one will accuse you of pedophilia, 
bestiality or some other disreputable predilection.
<P>
Of course, there are lots of other cases where you might want to 
ensure that no-one will ever be able to read your deleted files.
<P>
Data Destroyer will purge either: 
  - A single file. 
  - All files in a folder. 
  - A specified subset of files in a folder. 
  - All files in a folder and all files in all subfolders of that folder. 
  - A specified subset of all files in a folder and in all 
subfolders of that folder. 
  - All space on a disk. 
  - All unused clusters on a disk.
<P>
This software checks for possible errors in user input, 
and is designed to minimize the chance of accidentally 
purging a file that you wish to keep. 
<P>
It is even possible, in a multiple-file purge operation, 
to confirm the operation 
on each file before it is purged.
<P>
Another feature of Data Destroyer is that you can get an 
accurate estimate of the time required to perform a purge operation. 
A lengthy purge operation may require several hours, or even days, 
and if you did not have an accurate estimate 
of the time needed before beginning the operation you 
might get worried, not 
knowing how long it still has to run.
<P>
Data Destroyer erases data from any writable magnetic 
storage medium. 
<P>
It is not suitable for erasing data on CD-ROMs or other optical 
storage media.
