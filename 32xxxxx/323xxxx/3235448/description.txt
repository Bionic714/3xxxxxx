[Plot Summary]
Joel (Jim Carrey) is stunned to discover that his girlfriend 
Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had her memories of their tumultuous 
relationship erased. Out of desperation, he contracts the inventor 
of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwaik (Tom Wilkinson), to have 
Clementine removed from his own memory. But as Joel's memories 
progressively disappear, he begins to rediscover their earlier 
passion. From deep within the recesses of his brain, Joel attempts 
to escape the procedure. As Dr. Mierzwiak and his crew (Kristen 
Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood) chase him through the maze of his 
memories, it's clear that Joel just can't get her out of his head
