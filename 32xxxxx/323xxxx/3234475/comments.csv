Johnny (Randy Spears) has a massive sexual appetite. He needs it… a lot of it… and needs it bad. And he doesn’t care how nasty it gets. Hookers, sex in an alley, sex with strangers are all in a day’s work. Randy then meets Sylvie (Sunrise Adams) who is just as sex depraved. But soon the police catch up to Randy’s sexual deviancy and his sexual life comes to a climax. Will Randy be reformed, or will it be just another chapter in his sexual mischief?"
