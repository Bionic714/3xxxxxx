***This is the biggest post yet at 3xcd's but you know i will seed until you complete***
Alright here is the Ultimate Undertones Video Collection, this is most of the stuff i have by the Undertones. I have other TOTP's appearances but will be putting them up in some Punk TOTP's specials. I haven't got the promo videos on this as i don't have them from the DVD so i might put them up later but it would be from different TV sources. If someone has them from the DVD please post them. If i find any other bits and pieces i will post them in my Punk TV's. The documentary is a copy of the one that was posted here on punktorrents, i have edited out a few of the complete songs and they are in this post so that you can have the complete OGWT etc. So i hope you all appreciate the time and effort i put into this, Enjoy!
