,H-Jay,2004-08-26T16:06Z,"Har den h채r p책 VHS, originalinspelad fr책n tv :P"
,indoubt,2004-08-28T07:25Z,my humble opinion....ive downloaded it..and the quality sucks....im deleting it....
,Tarzan666,2004-08-28T11:06Z,"@indoubt; I'm sorry you feel this way. Did you burn a DVD, or did you just have a peek on your monitor? Try and burn it!
I still think the quality is good. Of course not the same as a official release, but compared to other TV-rip's or bootlegs..!

If it's just my quality-measures that are wrong, I humbly appologice for letting you download a file not good enough. 

It's good enough for both me and my fellow Metallica-collector's back home though... ;o)"
,indoubt,2004-08-29T16:23Z,"i have not compared it with anything,,,ive seen it on my standalone dvd player.....maybe the quality is better than other tv rips....but that dosent make it good...

By the way....im not a metallica fan, but just an individual who once in a while enjoy there music...and when i do, like witn everything else...the quality has to be good.......
but no hard fellings, im just gonna find something else,,,

have a good one"
,Tarzan666,2004-08-29T19:19Z,"@indoubt; I fully understand your point of view. Happy hunting! ;)

,Capo,2004-10-17T17:20Z,"Can somebody seed, please.."
,sbn,2004-12-25T16:52Z,"maybe this is a silly question, but WHY THE HELL are you copying from a VHS to a DVD, just to spread it?

some kind of 1 CD of XviD would  be more than sufficient for a VHS rip with stereo sound...

I'd download it, if it was 700 MB but hell not af 4gig DVD ISO...

this is waste of bandwidth, just my opinion.... "

,iftegod,2010-10-24T07:37Z,"I would love to get this video. I took my 14 yr old sister and my wife for thier first concert. We spent the night parting in the parking lot. Some how my sister got a stamp for the front row area and got all 10 of us in. We were front row for Bush, some gay German rap band and METALLICA. I got a pic from Kirt and still have a t shirt. please hook me up."
