This is a digitally processed copy of the concert. 
Totally around 115 minutes, intro and interview's included. The concert alone last's for around 95 minutes.
The original taping was done using a VHS recorder of good quality. 
This concert was broadcasted throughout Europe, and this particular copy is from NRK2 (Norwegian broadcast company). 
The picture and sound quality is very good, unless I wouldn't have bothered to upload it. 
ENJOY! Kill 'em All, right? ;o)
