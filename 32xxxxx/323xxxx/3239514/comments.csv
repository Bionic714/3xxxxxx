,Apocryphite,2005-01-06T17:37Z,"This is seriously good stuff. Someone help me seed though, my upload suck >_<"
,bergoo,2005-01-14T12:00Z,"Tackar så mycket för den här torrenten. var nästan vad jag letade efter. 

Är lite mer intresserad av genkis japankurser eftersom jag har böckerna. har du eller någon annan dem är jag tacksam om ngn kunde lägga upp dem."
,stevo9er,2005-01-19T08:26Z,After I complete it I am going to copy it onto my external and share it through my cable. Should take some of the load off of you.
,tamago,2005-04-17T00:16Z,"This rip is absolutely fantastic! Excellent quality despite the small file size, it really shows the strength of Ogg Vorbis. It's in mono but stereo is not needed in these educational sound files.

Some other guy uploaded similar files (Pimsleur Japanese I, II, III) but in mp3-format. The files are about 1.8 GB large and in quite a poor quality.

Great job!"
,yuki_san,2005-06-08T18:55Z,"Thanks for uploading this file!! 

BUT I need some help...
None of my players will open the ogg files (BS-player, Mediaplayer). Am I just stupid or do I need a special programme?? Anyone a suggestion? "

,flexnez,2005-07-03T15:53Z,Useless Ogg files. Can't be used with iPod.
,mr_mxyztplk,2005-07-10T13:06Z,"flexnez ---> Useless iPod. Can't be used with Ogg files.

IsKub  --> thanks"
,Liliedugg,2005-08-11T13:55Z,"What program do I need to play ogg-files? I'm downloading these files rather than the mp3 files that are 1,8Gig..."
,capuccinogirl,2006-01-17T09:44Z,"You can use Itunes to convert Ogg files into mp3, then put in your Ipod, or if you just want to listen with Itunes you just have to add a plugin."

,what112233,2006-05-13T17:56Z,"If anyone could seed this again, that would be great."
,eyerhyme,2006-07-01T17:56Z,Could someone please seed this again? thanks
,Gunwave,2007-03-21T02:10Z,Can someone reseed this. Please.
,halofubar,2007-11-01T05:30Z,"Unless anyone's an absolute fiend for Ogg files, there's no reason for a re-seed. Absolute Pimsleur's Japanese at http://www.halofubar.com has excellent quality MP3s of the full set."
,pbransford,2009-02-09T04:59Z,"halofubar, unless you have a tracker besides demonoid, that's useless for the majority of us.

Unless you have demonoid invites lying around to give out, that is.

Can you please post that here, the rest of the world would like to play."
,halofubar,2009-05-21T17:12Z,"@pbransford: Ah, but if you had only gone to the website you would see there are mirrors for here and MiniNova, neither of which require registration. ;)"
,babye20,2010-12-30T17:13Z,"Thanx:)
Shall seed till I complete learning everything(think years) 
VLC media player plays Ogg files."
,babye20,2010-12-30T17:18Z,"Opps, I meant to give +1"
