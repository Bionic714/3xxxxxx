Brilliant recent compilation of rare 60s US psych and punk much of it previously uncompiled. 22 tracks including the tripped out World Column's Lantern Gospel, The Crystal Chandelier's The Setting Of Despair Rainy Daze's In My Mind Lives A Forest and a bunch of other gems.

Exellent compilation.. really a must have.
It was when I heard this compilation I really got into and got interested in psychedelica.
