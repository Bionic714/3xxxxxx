Va - Owl DJ Set (Jazz-Soul-Latin).

89 tracks - 582.5mb - various biterates, mostly high though.

I put together this little collection of songs because me and a friend of mine was going to play jazz and soul and stuff like that one evening. but then i changed my mind cuz i made a promise to myself a long time ago not to play CD's at a club. So I brought a huge bag of LP's and played them instead :]
But I think its a quite nice collection of songs and decided to put it out for all to enjoy.

the tracklist is a bit to long to paste here, so you'll have to trust me when I say it's a good collection :] Everything from Gil Scott-Heron to Dizzy Gillespie and Nina Simone to Screamin Jay Hawkins..

enjoy and keep it seeded :]
