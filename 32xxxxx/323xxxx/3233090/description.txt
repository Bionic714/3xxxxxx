Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers - A Night in Tunisia (Blue Note-1960).

7 songs - 77mb @ --alt-presets-extreme - that is high VBR.

Trumpeter Lee Morgan, tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter, pianist Bobby Timmons and bassist Jymie Merritt formed one of the strongest of the many versions of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and are actually in fine form during the remainder of the satisfying set.

Classic Hard-Bop release from Mr. Blakey and the Messegers.
If you like your Bop, this is for you.

enjoy and seed :]
