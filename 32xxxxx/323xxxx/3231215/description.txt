|   Step into the world of Animal Crossing, where villagers live their      |
|   everyday lives in time with an actual 24-hour clock. To become a part   |
|   of the thriving village community, you'll get a job, buy a house and    |
|   interact with other villagers, some of which can be controlled by       |
|   friends and family.                                                     |

|   As you collect furnishings for your own house, check out what other     |
|   villagers have collected for their houses. Build relationships by       |
|   talking to other villagers, helping them with tasks and writing         |

|   Throughout the game, you'll collect an assortment of items and          |
