Rising Force was a revelation upon its release in 1984; Eddie Van Halen had 
introduced dazzling speed to the realm of rock guitar technique, and the 
compositions of Randy Rhoads had begun to fuse heavy metal with neo-classical 
influences, but no one before Yngwie Malmsteen was able to combine those 
elements with such blinding virtuosity. Malmsteen's innovative guitar style made 
Rising Force a mandatory primer for '80s metal guitarists, with its classical 
chord progressions and Malmsteen's use of harmonic minor scales, a wide vibrato 
imitative of classical violinists, and impossibly fast picking techniques, 
including the sweep-picked arpeggio (sort of a cross between strumming a chord 
and picking each note individually). Malmsteen's obsessions with Bach, Beethoven, 
and Paganini are used in the service of a dark, stately, gothic atmosphere and 
sent guitar students scurrying to learn their works as well as Malmsteen's own.
