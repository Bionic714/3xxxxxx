dope collection from the mastermind..
check it out..


"...LIMITED EDITION RELEASE! Manufactured independently by Ramble Krohn himself in anticipation of his upcoming tour dates throughout the US this fall, only a few thousand copies of "In Rare Form" will be circulated worldwide, a mere fraction of the fans who picked up his two smash albums "Dead Ringer" and "Since We Last Spoke". So be sure to cop your CD or double vinyl ASAP, before they're all gone! Includes 13 hard to find instrumental tracks (+ 5 bonus beats on CD) from some of RJ's best known collabos with MF Doom/Viktor Vaughn, Diverse, Soul Position, Copywrite, Cage, Tame-One and others...many of which have never been available to the public before in ANY format!.."

enjoy&share
peace
