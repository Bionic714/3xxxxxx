I have about a month ago uploaded CD 1 - just search for it, there are still a good number of seeders. If not, send me a note and I'll start seeding it again whenever this has finished up.

This is the first upload after I got new machinery and a synchronized megabit-line. Really good stuff, this should make good speed.

Enjoy
