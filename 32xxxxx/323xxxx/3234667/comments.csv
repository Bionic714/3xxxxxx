,blacklung2002,2006-04-25T10:14Z,"The Descriptor for this torrent is misleading. The PDF is of The Jolly Roger's Cookbook, NOT the anarchist cookbook. This is not a classic book, this is a piece of internet-created garbage.

The real anarchist cookbook was published in 1971, written by William Powell. 

Again, this is NOT the anarchist cookbook. dont waste your time downloading it.

Go to Textfiles.com, the anarchy section, if you want to view this book without having to download the POS."
