,Faoga,2004-09-08T10:39Z,Hmm. Jag kan installera via Daemon tools men sen klagar spelet på att skivan inte ligger i när jag ska spela. Vad gör man?
,ZeCone,2004-09-08T17:52Z, Faoga: du måste kopiera syberia.exe cracken som finns på cd1 in till din Syberia mapp

,Rotormaskin,2005-01-02T15:30Z,"Har samma problem som ""kinging"". Se gärna också min fråga om detta under Forum/Spel... Ligger just nu på sidan 2 där...

Kan det vara så att man måste bränna CD för att få det hela att funka? Någon som testat det?"
,Trigg3r,2005-03-10T18:49Z,Could some more seed please?
,chirivi,2005-03-26T22:58Z,"Hello everybody!!
Could somebody please tell me where to find the crack for this game?? Since the NFO file tells me the following

INSTALL NOTES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For ultra pleasure, copy the crack before you play.

But the crack is not included in this download, and now the game does not work.
I searched the internet for it, but the cracks I found do not work with this game.

Anybody out there that can help me??

TNX a lot

,Vennegoor,2005-05-14T18:01Z,"Jag har samma problem; att allting sker i slowmotion... vet någon något sätt att fixa det? Jag VILL ju verkligen spela spelet, det verkar skithäftigt, men det vete fan om jag orkar med den här farten..."
,Kerafyrm,2005-05-18T19:25Z,Patching the game will fix the slowmotion problem =) 
,rounder,2005-05-21T15:29Z,"thx goes to you all for still sharing Syberia.
the graphics is like a piece of art. amazing."
,time66,2005-05-24T19:10Z,My gf will love me forever if i get it - thx
,heALer,2005-06-06T10:29Z,"TO FIX THE SLOWMOTION PROBLEM.
Just download this patch/update, http://3dgamers.intelenet.net/pub/3dgamers/games/syberia/syberia_sp3.exe

The game will work fine! Use the crack on CD1.

,Norwegian Jim,2005-07-10T16:43Z,"When it says ""insert disc 2"" I mount disc 2 with deamon, but that does nothing. In addition the picture gets all messed up when I mount the second disc. Any suggestions?"
,ohorlanth,2005-07-29T13:43Z,"I've encountered several problems with this game and I'm hoping for help. So here goes:

I've burnt the images on CD. When I try to install with full or medium install, an error occurs at some point, when files from the second disc are being installed. Only the minimal installation option works (most likely, because it doesn't try to install the specific file causing the error). Anyone stumbled across the same problem? Anyone found a solution?

Well, I got the game to work with the minimal installation and played it until it asks for the second disc. No problem - I insert the second disc. But then, nothing happens. I can click the ok button for as long as I like, but nothing happens. I'm thinking if it has to do with the file that caused problems already when I tried to install the game with medium or full options. Does anyone have a workaround?"
,ohorlanth,2005-07-29T14:02Z,"To maybe answer to my previous problems and to present a new one: When the game asks for the second CD to be inserted, it specifically asks for a CD titled SYBERIA2. Unfortunately the CD I have, isn't titled at all and therefore the game doesn't accept it. Can I somehow influence the title of the CD at burntime despite burning from an image? Or can I make the game believe that the title of the second CD is SYBERIA2, if I use Daemon Tools or something similar?"
,rounder,2005-08-01T09:59Z,ohorlanth: if you use Alcohol 120 you can run the game/CD's from virtual drives. works fine and no need to burn. just mount the second CD-image rzr-sb2 when asked and continue to play.
,whois1010,2005-08-05T10:10Z,"i installed the game by mounting cd1 & cd2 with alcohol 120%, i remount cd1, the syberia window pops up, i try an press play, and it's says please insert first syberia disk an restart application. can anyone help, or know what's causing this?"
,rounder,2005-08-05T13:24Z,whois1010: you might have forgotten to apply the crack before playing the game? explore the mounted CD1 and you'll find a folder named Razor1911. in that folder you'll find the file Syberia.exe. copy that file to the folder where you installed the game and answer Yes when asked if you wanna overwrite the existing file with the same name. then play!
,whois1010,2005-08-05T22:08Z,"thanx for the help rounder, works great now!"
,whois1010,2005-08-10T05:57Z,"finished game today, very well worth the download. great graphics, and storyline."

,24karat,2006-01-07T19:52Z,"Har mountat o  fått allt att funka, men efter halva spelet så ska man ju byta skiva, har mountat den andra men det verkar inte funka? nån som vet vad jag ska  göra? Har testat mountat båda två på en gång med deamontools men inget verkar fungera.. hjälp snälla!"
,Admiral-K,2006-01-08T16:03Z,"Any1 got problems with game crashing? Happens to  me allmost in the middle of game, at the university..................Cant play anymore :("
,Vennegoor,2006-02-14T16:54Z,"I had the cd2-problem too, and here's how I solved it:
You need a patch called Syberia CD2 Fix-Razor1911, which you can get from www.crackdb.com
Download it, open it and use it on the rzr-sb2-file in the cd2-folder. That should do the trick!
Terrific game btw :)"
,johnny_88,2006-03-06T21:56Z,"Does this game have a tutorial? I'm playing but so far im guessing my controls. And also, why does the guy start talking before he finishes the last word of his first previous sentence. kinda annoying..."

I did everything hasit is suposed, mounted the images, installed, crack and all, everything went smoothly, but when i'm going to press the icon to play the game, it enters in the game only to one second after come back to windows and it remains black square in the upper end of the screen (apparently the game is on, but everything is black) but it doesn't let me play! Can anyone help me?"
,LeInsomniac,2008-11-12T18:58Z,"Now I discovered it says in a little window [Syberia: Initialization problem] and continues saying that the 3d rendering engine could not be initialized. I find this odd, since I have more than enough to  run the game at top. Could it be a problem in the instalation process>? Maybe something happened? I dunno."

,dmcaexploit,2009-10-12T14:52Z,"If you savor your memories of adventure games long past, DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!

Holy christ I regretted it. The worst kind of must-do-this-even-though-it-makes-no-sense-to-trigger-an-event tedium, nonsensical dialogue that forces you to click every single dialogue option for every character you meet, terribly slow and unfriendly game mechanics (""I'm sorry, but you'll have to walk me 10 screens away to find out you failed before you can reattempt to work the machine right in front of you correctly even though you already know you did it wrong!""). 

Utter garbage. I have no idea how this abomination got good reviews. Download ""The Longest Journey"" instead if you want classic adventure."
