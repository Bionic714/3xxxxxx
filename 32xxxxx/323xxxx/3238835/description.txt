Game Notes:

    Conflict: Vietnam concentrates on the experiences of four 101st 
    airborne soldiers cut off from their unit in the opening shots of the
    infamous 1968 Tet offensive. Faced with day to day survival in a 
    hostile and alien landscape, our heroes are not concerned with the 
    course of the war. Their only goals are escaping from the NVA and the 
    Viet Cong, and finding enough weapons, food and medical supplies to 
    keep going. The game focuses on their experiences as they inch their 
    way back to the relative safety of the Imperial city of Hue. 

    You'll have to depend on four men to make it through this hostile 
    terrain: 
    Staff Sergeant Frank Wier, your leader and rifleman, Corporal Bruce 
    Lesh, your sniper and grenadier, Corporal Will Shafer, your machine 
    gunner, and Private Harold Kahler, your field medic. 

    You'll need to keep all four alive in order to make it to Hue, and
    need to fully utilize every one if you plan on surviving at all.
