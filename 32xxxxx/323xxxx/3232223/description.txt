Out from Out Where follows Supermodified. Amon Tobin weighs in with yet  another awesome release, proving yet again what a unique soundmaker he  is. Sonically, there's just as much murderous intent as before, clear  from the track, "Verbal". Tobin has certainly tried to place less 
 emphasis on the trappings of jazz on this record. It's far harder-edged, 
 darker and moodier than ever. Warped drum and bass overtones join the 
 fray of this sonic genius.
