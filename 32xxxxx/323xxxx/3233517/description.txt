Ishimatsu is a cleaner in a restaurant, making a living as best he can. When a battle breaks out there between two criminal gangs, Ishimatsu manages to save the life of one of the highest-ranking bosses in the yakuza, the infamous Japanese mafia. In exchange, he is handsomely rewarded with an introduction into the world of crime, and by extension money, sex and drugs. Ishimatsu begins climbing up through the ranks, his brutal acts making him a particularly feared gangster. However, his violent streak and near-psychotic rages soon pose serious problems for him. Over his short career, he burns many bridges and turns his back on too many fellow crooks. When he kills his boss—the gravest error imaginable in the honour-driven Japanese underworld—he begins an inexorable downward spiral into a living hell. Ishimatsu’s story is one of absolute human decay, a excruciating tragedy that only the crime world could produce.
