,FASTED,2007-08-14T12:47Z,"You messed up the filenames when you made the dam rar file now we have to go through these one by one and rename from the list here atleast we got it to go by but who wants to copy and paste a 100 freakin file names,thanks for the effort anyway but dam your making us work for it, it can be fixed so easily on your end and reseeded."
,artvandelay2007,2008-02-13T13:29Z,"I appreciate people sharing, but I wish people would use their heads when putting together the files. Apart from the renaming problem the last poster mentioned, WHY RAR mp3s? There won't be very much space saved by doing so. Mp3's are already compressed. And if someone wants just a song or two, they have to download the whole damn RAR. Such a waste of bandwidth for everyone involved (including the seeders)"
