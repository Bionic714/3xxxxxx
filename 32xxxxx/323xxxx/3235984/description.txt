Transvision Vamp's Wendy James solo album.
Every track on the album is (co)-written by Elvis Costello. 
The music is pretty solid, transvisioned though it is, 
and few artists could ask for a better lyricist than Costello.
That said, the lyrics on the album don't always measure up to
Costello's usual standard. This might not be such a big deal if
James' voice wasn't mixed so prominently to the forefront; this is
solo (with a capital S).
