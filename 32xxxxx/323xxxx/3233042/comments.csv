,gilknut,2008-06-25T12:13Z,"LOL - it might be worth mentioning that these are all ridiculous remakes by the pathetic ""comeback"" line-up that toured Scandinavia in the late eighties, with Alan Barton (R.I.P.) singing/sobbing. 

For the actual Smokie hits from the 70's (with Chris Norman singing), you need to look elsewhere. 

The reason I even mention it is because the picture above is actually from the original line-up, so it's kind of misleading. "
