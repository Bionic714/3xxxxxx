plot: Prepare to be blown away. Pablo Francisco: Bits And Pieces sends 
you into the whirlwind comedy of this rising star. Filmed in the 
O.C., the show features explosive material that tears apart

Justice. With his uncanny talent for creating vivid images using 
strikingly authentic, off-the-wall sound effects, Pablo keeps the laughs coming.
