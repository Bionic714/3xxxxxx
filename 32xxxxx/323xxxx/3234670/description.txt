      When an eviction notice shows up at the gates of the Patch of
      Heaven dairy farm, three cows take it upon themselves to
      prevent their home from being taken away. To do so, they'll
      need to collect the ransom on Alameda Slim, a cattle rustler
      with a yodel that can't be beat ... or ignored.
