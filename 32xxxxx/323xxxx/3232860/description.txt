Family - Music In a Dolls House (1968)

15 songs - 69.3mb @ 256kbps CBR.

The bands stunning debut from 1968 mixing psychedelia, haunting orchestration and the bands own unique folk/blues crossover style. Roger Chapman ranks as one of the most recognisable male vocalists of all time and his urgent style perfectly fits the otherworldly and times tripped out atmosphere of this great album.

enjoy and seed.

I say it again SEED!! don't just leach.. ok?!
