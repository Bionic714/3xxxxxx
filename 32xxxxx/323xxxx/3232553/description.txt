Software Notes


Set in ancient Japan and steeped in real-life folkore and
mysticism, this is the story of Raikoh, an undead warrior who
must stop a ferocious demonic army that has been unleashed upon
the Earth. Blending frentic 3D action with deep RPG elements,
you'll master 30+ weapons, 12 varieties of magic, and dozens of
stylish combat moves. Explore 25+ massive, highly-destructible
environments in which even buildings can be destroyed. Upgrade
weapons, magic, character attributes, and manage an inventory
of special items.
