Put simply, Ozone makes music sound better. How it does it may be complex,
 but the results are simple and clearly heard.

 As a plug-in for Winamp, Ozone adds warmth, bass, sparkle and an overall
 desirable sound to your MP3s. Unlike other "enhancers", it does so by
 modeling the analog characteristics of vintage audio equipment such as tube
 amplifiers and valve equalizers. So instead of sounding harsh and hollow,
 your music sounds deep and full.
