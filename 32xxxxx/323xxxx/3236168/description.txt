Game information:
=================
Conflict: Vietnam is the third entry in the Conflict series, which began
with Conflict: Desert Storm. Developer Pivotal Games is taking the series
a few decades back to the Vietnam War and is placing you in the role of a
new recruit who finds himself cut off behind enemy lines during the 1968
Tet Offensive. Your goal is to make it through 100 miles of booby-trapped
and enemy-infested terrain, along with your squad, to get to the capital
city of Hue. Today we'll offer a look at the new skill system that's being
implemented into the latest iteration of Conflict to add a new element to its
gameplay. The skill advancement system in Conflict: Vietnam lets you choose
one of nine different skill sets for the members of your squad to specialize
in. These features add a level of customization that makes it possible to
build up all manner of squad configurations, such as a stealth-kill team
consisting entirely of snipers or a squad of heavy-weapon experts.

You'll increase the different skills available to you with points that you
earn for completing primary and bonus objectives, such as taking down enemy
soldiers and vehicles, maintaining fire accuracy, and successfully executing
stealth kills. Points are deducted for killing civilians and friendly
soldiers. These points are split among the four squadmates and are then spent
to raise their skills in such skill categories as Pistol, Assault Rifle,
Sniper Rifle, Machine Gun, Grenade, Shotgun, Medic, Rocket Launcher,
and Booby Traps. The higher the skill, the more points it costs to raise.
