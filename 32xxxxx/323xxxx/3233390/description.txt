Fine afro/funk/jazz/world/african album, so many styles it's hard to categorize, but still hell of an album hehe.
My pick would be Music For Gong-Gong, simply amazing and always played by me when I Dj.
From what I've been told Osibisa should be experienced live, I'm sad to say though that I've never had the pleasure. I know they played here a couple of years ago, but unfortunately I found out about it to late.
They play an assortment of instruments including, sax, flute, congas, african drums, flugel horn, guitar, organ and many more.
Quote from the sleeve "Criss-cross rhythms that explode with happiness"

Vinyl rip so expect som hiss and pops, slightly cleaned though.

Enjoy the happy vibes and SEED!! :]
