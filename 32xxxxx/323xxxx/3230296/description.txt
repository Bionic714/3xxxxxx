Wong Fei Hong (Jackie Chan) is sent to train under his uncle, a wine guzzling master famous for crippling his students. Desperate to escape this brutal teacher's cruel regime, he flees but is confronted, humiliated and beaten senseless by a hired assassin (Hwang Jang lee). Angry, ashamed, hungry for revenge, the wayward Fei Hung returns to his drunken master. This is the second collabration between director Yuen Woo Ping and Jackie Chan was another huge box-office hit, drawing in 8 million HK dollars on its run
