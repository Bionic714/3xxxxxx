8 albums from geto boys..Bushwick Bill, Scarface & Willie D/Big Mike..

from times where ganksta shyt wasn't as wack as most acts 
nowadays..some very dope beats & rhyming from the houston cats..
have been very influential..
though the first line-up was different..Lil' J (rap-a-lot) gathered the 3 mentioned after the the original line-up has split..
