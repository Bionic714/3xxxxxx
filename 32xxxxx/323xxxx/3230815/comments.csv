,MisterHeavy,2008-08-05T10:48Z,"99.4%, no sign of a seed and people are STILL d/l so they'll soon be stuck like the rest of us. 

Today the info panel says 1 seed - 53 leeching.

I haven't seen a seed in months in my client (azureus)

Here are the incomplete songs
/Geto_Boys-We_Cant_Be_Stopped-1991-GMZ
  03-geto_boys-homie_dont_play_that-GMZ.mp3
  05-geto_boys-chuckie-GMZ.mp3
  11-geto_boys-quickie-GMZ.mp3
  13-geto_boys-the_other_level-GMZ.mp3

/Geto_Boys-Uncut_Dope-1992-GMZ
 02-geto_boys-assassins-old-GMZ.mp3
 03-geto_boys-mind_of_a_lunatic-old-GMZ.mp3
 07-geto_boys-and_my_word-old-GMZ.mp3
 08-geto_boys-scarface_original-old-GMZ.mp3

"
,MisterHeavy,2008-08-19T10:43Z,"still as it was.

Occasionally we'll see 1 seed on the list. - in swarm, but not connected - Is this real, or is it a tracker system glitch?

If anyone has actually connected to a 100% seed in the past few weeks, could they please leave a note here, just so we know?

If you ARE that 100% seed, please stay on this damn thing until enough of us who will also seed have got it.
Ta.

Meanwhile, if anyone is thinking of downloading this for the first time, it is going to be the same for you too. Either reconsider, or be prepared for 8 of the songs to be missing."
,plasmafox2038,2008-08-20T17:10Z,somebody make a torrent of the missing songs and link it here
