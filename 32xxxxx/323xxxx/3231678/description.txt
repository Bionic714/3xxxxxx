With tracks from The Spice Girls, Ace of Base and Madness Dancing Stage Fever fields a very impressive range of licensed tunes across both its PSone and PlayStation 2 versions. However, the PlayStation 2 enjoys a wider range of songs (including Dexy Midnight Runners Come on Eileen)and certain tracks in the PlayStation 2 version are also accompanied by their pop video, enhancing the visual appeal of the game immensely.
