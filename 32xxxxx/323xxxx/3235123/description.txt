       There is evil everywhere most people just can't see it.
        Monsters are hiding among us.  They are our babysitters,
        our policemen, our bartenders, even our friends.  Once 
        you realize it's around you there's no way for you to 
        ignore it, messages are sent, magical powers are 
        received forcing you to realize that your only job 
        now is to take back the world from the monsters that 
        seek to destroy it.  You have become a Hunter!
