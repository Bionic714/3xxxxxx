,bygdegaard,2004-08-19T11:30Z,"great...pt.2 plz (when you have time of course)
:)"
,GenOxide,2004-08-20T03:08Z,"erm sorry. i didn't even recognize the track 6 was missing :( i hope to get it otherwise.. well a good friend of mine has the original tape ;) I'll share it as soon i got the taperip or find it again... or anyone else could share the trak if he owns it... one hand helps the other one :)

also in part 2 on the constant shallowness leads to evil the last track is not split into 23 pieves but in one track ;) so don't wonder about the ""missing"" tracks on this album.."
