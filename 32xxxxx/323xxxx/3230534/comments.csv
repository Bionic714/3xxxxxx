,mrsaud,2004-08-12T22:02Z,"I got an error when extracting, from this file:

Custom.Retestrak.XP.Pro.SP2.Unattended.DVD.part15"
,Klosso,2004-08-12T22:34Z,Thats the second upload from retestrak thats corrupt. Maybe time to check that you got a working version before you upload next time???
,damage,2004-08-13T08:38Z,I also got a corrupt .r15 file. This release is worthless!
,Klosso,2004-08-13T10:36Z,"It doesn't need to be worthless. If anyone have a working copy, please upload the corrupt file as a separate torrent.
Thanks! :)"
,Zaloo,2004-08-13T14:30Z,"Samma fel för mig, crc check failed in part15...

Vore ju tacksamt om någon med fungerande laddade upp part 15 till oss hungrande."
