And it works fine.

Only (minor) problem was that the installer is buggy... a bug confirmed by wmware themselves. A cryptic error message might appear (possibly depending on what host OS you're running), which you'll have to click ""OK"" on for several times (up to 8-10). After that the installation continues successfully.

Say what? ""Why download this old crap?"" Well.. my server is old crap too... so I thought it made sense to run old software on an old comp. :)"
