Reign Ghost - Reign Ghost (1969).

8 songs - 48.2mb @ 160kbps CBR.

Debut album by the leaders of the Canadian '60s underground psychedelic scene. It's certainly one of the rarest Candian psych albums. Featuring the amazing voice of Lynda Squires and the guitar talents of Bob Bryden (later of Christmas) the band begs comparison with Jefferson Airplane and others of that genre with male female vocals, trippy keyboards and guitar work.

enjoy and seed it :]
