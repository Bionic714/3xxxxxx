                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a special investigation the fifth estate's Bob McKeown finds that even the 
most outlandish conspiracy theory may have its basis in a legitimate question. 
In the course of separating fact from fiction, Bob delves into the labyrinthine 
and surprising ties between the Bushes and the Bin Ladens. What he finds out may 
startle you as much as any conspiracy theory. 

For a quarter of a century, the fifth estate has been Canada's premier 
investigative documentary program, acquainting viewers with a dazzling parade of 
political leaders, shady characters and ordinary people whose lives were touched 
by triumph or tragedy.In addition to its impact among viewers and on society, 
the fifth estate is also recognized by its peers. It has won a remarkable 227 
awards, including an Oscar for best documentary, three international Emmy 
Awards, 28 Geminis, 20 awards and certificates for investigative reporting from 
the Canadian Association of Journalists and dozens of honours from The New York 
and Columbus International film and video festivals.
