From AMG:

"Loreena McKennitt blends acoustic and electronic elements in her sound design as well as anybody and better than most. Her vocal prowess is readily apparent, as is her virtuosity on the Celtic harp. Casual listeners will miss her intricate atmospheres (built with the synth), her smooth arrangements, and her production expertise. The Visit features McKennitt at her best in all of these capacities. Her expertise at so many functions qualifies her as a true renaissance woman. She is that and much more. Her musical skills elevate this disc to classic status. Each facet is as important as the next; there are no highlights -- the entire disc is a highlight. This CD will appeal to fans of Lisa Lynne, Patricia Spero, Kim Robertson, and Susan Craig Winsberg."
