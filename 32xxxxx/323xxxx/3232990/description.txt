                         Avalaunch v0.49.1 (build 62) Release Notes
===============================================================================


Yepp.. Somehow we figured we'd fix a lot of problems and send out another one =)
Many things works better now, and some things now works which never did before.

Overall, we're very happy with this version. Gueux'net guys have been helpful
in every way they have been able to, testers have skipped sunbathing to nail 
the last bugs on the list and just a few of our programmers know that it's 
summer at all... (Don't tell them)

We are aiming high on the dotfifty engine now tho. 2 coders are putting in all 
their spare time into some massive UI system, 1 coder went to a monastery in tibet 
for meditation and to find himself. ( altho someone said he went to Thailand instead )
and a couple others are working on what ended up here with this textfile.
Either way... what I mean with all this is that these releases is just our 
steppingstone to what we really want. 



About video mode switching
--------------------------
To avoid confusion, the runtime modeswitch changes EEPROM values, and 
reinitializes screen - then to overwrite with the previous values,
leaving the screenmode as you selected till reboot).

===============================================================================
                                     NOTE
===============================================================================
The EEPROM is an essential part of your Xbox. It contains all the information
the hardware needs to initialize properly. Manipulating the data contained in
this chip always involves a certain risk, as bad data, power failures and other
elements beyond Avalaunch's control can interfere. Although Avalaunch creates
backups, and does everything in its power to ensure that your EEPROM is not
corrupted, we cannot and will not take responsibility for the data contained in
your EEPROM. Please use all EEPROM-manipulating features at your own risk.

                                   CHANGELOG
===============================================================================

Audio
-----
Removed SDL
Made OGG/Vorbis decoder codec.
Fixed the WMA codec so you can skip songs here now without having it change on it's own

Core 
----
Yow can boot as a single file, little crashbug there
Cleared some xbe flags that allows ava to boot on empty hdd
Keyboard up disables music control
Keyboard doesnt mix in with settings menu
videomode/videoflags/audioflags/parental settings uses nothing but kernel calls now, still leaving in all security
eeprom key to unlock some keys tended to get zero'ed out after IGR on some bioses, so we put in the default one
Added a hddlock feature that keeps a secure backup of the keys, comparing them so it will only lock if keys match
Fixed so warning/info boxes can contain more than one line - esp made for eeprom warning and KAI onjoin
remade the default bootlogo to a higher res so it looks a tad more slick

Filemanager
-----------
fixed the weird shade on most resolutions

KAI
---
Fixed crashbugs when joining rainbow 6 and halo + more
Fixed the crashbug that occurs when you try to attach to KAI while it's already started at boot

Languages
---------
Added Portugese language file (by GamerBR).

QuickStart
----------
Changed path handling. QuickStart shouldn't be quite as picky on how you specify the paths anymore.

Screensaver
-----------
screensaver-x both loads and stays loaded now - as opposed to loads and being overwritten in memory as it used to
changed to reflection type mapping on the texture to make it a bit nicer-looking

Settings
--------
Fixed the IDE Master/Slave typo.
Fixed a keyboard priority error making keyboard look funny
Fixed XBFTP keyboard thumbstick by disabling music control if keyboard is up
Fixed the KAI username/password keyboard bug
Fixed KAI password/username info disappearing

skins
-----
fixed a few allxboxskins-bugs in those archives where skins aren't compressed with dir
Moved screensaver.x to skins ( but will still read the xbe-one/in the xbe-dir if nothing is located with skin )

Telnet Client
-------------
Kicks user to menu instead if entertaining it in an eternal loop if an error occures

Updater
-------
Fixed a major problem within updating that would pretty much render it useless. ( make sure it really got updated to this one )
( old updater might require you to delete olddash.xbe )
