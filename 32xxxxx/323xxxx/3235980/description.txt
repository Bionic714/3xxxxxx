''This alarming program reveals the daily 
battle between the Internet’s outlaws and the hackers 
who oppose them by warding off system attacks, 
training IT professionals and police officers, 
and watching cyberspace for signs of imminent infowar. 

<img src="http://www33.brinkster.com/puttefnask/oa2.bmp"> 

Through interviews with frontline personnel from the 
Department of Defense, NYPD’s computer crime squad, 
private detective firm Kroll Associates, 
X-Force Threat Analysis Service, and several notorious crackers, 
the program provides penetrating insights into the millions 
of hack attacks that occur annually in the U.S. 
—including one that affected the phone bills of millions 
and another that left confidential details of the B-1 stealth 
bomber in the hands of teenagers.

The liabilities of wireless networks, 
the Code Red worm, and online movie piracy are also discussed.
