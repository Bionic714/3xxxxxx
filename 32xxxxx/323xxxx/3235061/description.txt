***This is a cracker of a post, even if i say so myself***
Alright here is one helluva a post, two Pennywise videos both really rare and both in SVCD

Pennywise-Live Modena Italy 2 October 1992 SVCD 52 Minutes

Pennywise-Home Movies Rare OOP Official Video 1995 SVCD 44 Minutes

Heres the quote from the back of the video cover:-

"Dive head first into the live, uncensored world of PENNYWISE. Live concert footage, interviews, band practice, tour footage from around the world and of course, more vomiting than any video ever released. What more could you ask for?"

These are in PAL SVCD format and both can be burned to CD and they will play in most DVD players. Each will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
