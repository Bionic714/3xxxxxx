,SomeCubanGuy,2005-08-15T00:43Z,"i have a question ..... I used to play a lot of Epsxe Emu but recently i have heard of the PS2 emu, But when i read up on the PS2 emus on Emu sites they all say that the PS2 Emu out right now only runs like 2-3 games .... but yet on Pirate bay i see a crap load of PS2 Iso & DVD CD img files up all the time ? can anyone plz confirm that they have a Up & Running PS2 emu and have Successfully Ran Games on it like Tekken 5 < Gran turismo 4, Metal Gear Solid 3. PLz any1 reply and tell me if these PS files on Pirate Bay actually work ^-^"
,lovethissite,2006-01-25T19:55Z,"Dude all the ps2 iso's work on Pirate Bay this site is top notch and has it's shit together, what won't work is trying to run them on a ps2 emu as it's still in early stages. Unless you own a computer the size of nasa's control room you ain't gonna be played them soon either, or your a fucking genius and can program code better than Bill Gates. So in the mean time buy a ps2 they are only a few quid these days, get it chipped or use swap magic like the rest of us, actually what i meant to say is ""go buy the original"" LOL "

Still don't know why some people add password protection on their torrents as with one extra search you could download a .Rar password cracker?!?

Just a though...you it don't use it.

Will try and write the game....will provide some feedback later!
