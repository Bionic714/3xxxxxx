,Aenima,2004-09-09T15:26Z,"Note: This movie was originally recorded without subtitles (in Japan), after which a third party added them (apparently a haste job, so don't expect fancy stuff like proper grammar ;)"
,TheNinth,2004-09-09T17:44Z,"This is a cam (yep, someone dragged a camera to the theatre) and the quality is extremely poor. I would strongly advise against downloading this release, even if this is possibly the best animated movie released in years (it came out in March I think. The international premier is in about a month)

This cam is the only availability of this movie on the net so far, and Hawks is the only group that has subtitled it (theya re a pretty skilled group too).

Keep an eye out for this movie in theatres, you definately dont want to miss it. :)

,Aenima,2004-09-09T19:50Z,"Just for the record, I disagree with the quality part.  It's quite decent.  Also, it's a TS, not just a Cam."
,TheNinth,2004-09-09T23:42Z,"According to Hawks, its a 'cleaned up cam'."
,Aenima,2004-09-10T05:41Z,"Well, there was no chatter from the audience, so I'm guessing it was either shot from the projector room, shot in an empty theater or shot with an external sound source (like audio ouputs in armrests for aurally impaired people), making it a TS.  Then again, the Japanese could just be more polite than Americans when it comes to stuff like being noisy in theaters."
,Aenima,2004-09-15T13:27Z,"Alright, there's a DVDRip of Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, with subs by hAWks out.  I suggest you ignore this Cam/TS and go for the rip instead."
,TheNinth,2004-09-16T01:39Z,Hawks are allso working on a DVD-R release of this movie.
