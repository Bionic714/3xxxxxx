,CsMbI,2004-08-11T13:27Z,"Hmmm. No idea.
Is everything the same (HW, firmware, programs)? That's why I mentioned the write/firmware/programs.
If not, You might need to look for Your own method. Start with the CDFreaks. Probably You will write a guide as well that worked for You. :-)"

,CsMbI,2004-08-11T18:30Z,"Ah, I forgot that from the story.
When that box comes thre are three options. Choose the first one (that is the recommended).
Use 700MB (80 min CD)."
,Trichem,2004-08-11T20:18Z,"grr didnt worked, tried 3 cds now, and when i shall install it , the window comes up : please insert the orginal cd "" spellforce - the breath of winter, bla bla :/"
,CsMbI,2004-08-11T21:23Z,"Hmmm. What burner do You have?
Which versions of SWs did You use?"
,Trichem,2004-08-12T00:09Z,"i got a upgraded nec1300a
"
,CsMbI,2004-08-12T07:43Z,"You may need to find a different method then. I don't have such burner, so I cannot help You.
Start with a search in the cdfreaks forums."
,Something,2004-08-15T08:20Z,"I burnt and installed it and everything works...however to play the game I require a non-blacklisted CD-Key/Serial!

Does anyone have a working one? or a possible way around the problem? "
,Crow82,2004-09-09T02:15Z,i did the same thing....use Alcohol 120% and u dont have too use so much Cd's anymore burn the game on your harddrive and find a nocd patch on GameCopyWorld Mirrors.com....that will do...
,AssPirate,2004-10-01T16:41Z,"7. Start TwinPeak. Click 'select CCD image', and select the image You just extracted. Click 'select BWA file' and select the BWA file from step 1. (sfaddon1.bwa, 27 652 bytes).

Wont go further than this, most disturbing.
Twinpeak tells me that i cant open the image file, anyone know why ?"
,Larwex,2004-12-23T00:24Z,"When the game don't work, try running a spellforcecleaner.exe.."
,Nargathos,2005-05-05T18:09Z,"What is this spellforcecleaner.exe. Where can i get it and can i use it to install expansion. Cant install any expansion neither patch the game...

please lead me anyone..."
