Family - Family Entertainment (1969).

11 songs - 92mb @ 320kbps CBR + covers and inlay.

Family's second album. A fantastic late 60s progressive rock album that mixes many styles from folk through to psych and blues fronted by Roger Chapmans unique vocal style. Perhaps a bit more down to earth than their debut but still a masterpiece that deserves your full attention.

enjoy and seed :]
