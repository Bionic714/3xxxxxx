In sync as far as I could tell, but a few glitches, and it's mono!
V: 5
Watchable, but loads more artefacts than there should be with this file size, and I had to play with brightness settings. And I can't think of a reason why anyone would split at 355/366MB.

S/L currently 83/31.

Having said all of that, I've only watched the first 50 mins - it's extremely slow, with fairly appalling acting and no plot! I have no idea how it got onto IMDB's Top 250!"
,Aim_To_Maim,2011-08-17T14:03Z,Probably got in because you have bad taste!
