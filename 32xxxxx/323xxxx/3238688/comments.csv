,werminard999,2005-07-10T22:53Z,I'm now listening to track no. 8 and two of songs so far (05 and 07) were cut off in the middle. Sloppy work :(
,waccu,2006-03-06T11:07Z,"Hi there ""werminard999"". It's not in the middle of the song's 5&7. It's at the end. Track 5 is going for 3.56minuts and track 7 is going for 2.15minuts. This kind of music is something you listen to when there is party for the oldies,so I dont see the point of calling it sloppy work. By the way you can just go and buy the music if you think the quality in here is to bad."
,waccu,2006-03-06T11:11Z,"Oooops sorry I almost forgot to say thank's to  ""ABZeta99"". Thank you very much for this torrent. Loving every minut of the music."
,monx2,2006-08-15T02:13Z,song 1988-053 (Taylor Dayne - Tell it to my heart) is a trance remix instead of the original
