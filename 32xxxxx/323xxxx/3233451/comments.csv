,andypmastermc,2009-03-05T19:30Z,I love this film. I makes me wish I was born 25 years earlier. But then that would make me 55. Hmmm.....
,tonyromano777,2010-10-15T22:14Z,"Wow excellent, just saw Control and heard about this, thanks a lot :-)"
,JimBeamLean,2011-09-15T06:03Z,"Good but not great quality. A:8 V:7. The audio volume is kind of low, and the video clarity could definitely be sharper. Complete movie, w/end credits, aspect ratio just a tad more narrow vertically than 16:9. Thank you"
