,gottajuboo,2008-01-16T17:49Z,"I have been waiting for weeks to get this awesome DVD and now that i have it i have no clue how to play it. Does anyone know how to play this file? The type of files are BUP, IFO, and VOB's. Someone give a brother a clue here. Thank you"
,mysticmon,2008-02-01T16:13Z,"That's the standard set of files you will find on a DVD.  If you look at the file directory in a program like Nero Recode (or any DVD backup program), it will appear just as if it was a DVD.  Just use your favorite DVD backup program and burn away.  "
,batterylife99,2008-05-10T22:15Z,PLEASE seed! I love this movie and need it for a school project!

,ethan420,2008-07-25T05:53Z,"This dvd is PAL. If you are from North America this dvd will not work in most dvd players. I converted it to NTSC using this method http://www.videohelp.com/forum/archive/pal-to-ntsc-dvd-full-disc-conversion-hybrid-method-very-easy-t319127.html

Thank you so much catweazle for this upload! I couldn't find this movie anywhere else."
,Svensson450,2008-11-01T14:28Z,"Amazing speed! Can't wait to see it, thanks!"
,Daker9,2008-11-23T02:09Z,Thanks for the great upload. I am in Canada and after burning it even though it is PAL it plays on most modern DVD players...
,DjenghisKhan,2010-07-14T21:38Z,Made my day finding this!
,MPjordan,2010-12-19T09:15Z,This is musical awesomeness. only 16 seeders!? ill seed for a while once i finish dling it.  People need to see this.
,jackce,2011-03-27T18:53Z,"Does anybody know where I can find this in NTSC? I converted it to PAL using the method ethan420 described and I also let ConvertXtoDVD 4 do it and both tmes the copy had slight jitter in it. I don't want an AVI, but an exact DVD copy like this torrent."

,petersky7,2012-05-02T00:34Z,"Thanks for the excellent upload. Good choice of content. As for converting to NTSC (or region-free) you could try just running it through DVDShrink. I cannot say for certain if this works. I don't have this problem as I bought a DVD player that could easily be made region-free. ""Prevention is better than cure."""
