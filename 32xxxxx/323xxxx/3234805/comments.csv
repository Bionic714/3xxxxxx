Thanks All, 
Azrith"

,stranger3201,2009-10-07T20:06Z,Nice production.  Unfortunately (without spoiling the plot) the moral of the story kinda reeks of pro-communist propaganda.  Or at least pro-government propaganda.  It's hard for me to believe it wasn't made with the Chinese government's eager blessing and sponsorship.
,buddahass,2010-02-05T07:00Z,"Much thanks David! 

...and long live the nine persevering seeders supporting this Heroic effort. I'll be ten.   "
