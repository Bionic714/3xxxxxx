Symantec Norton Ghost 9.0

TDA totally fucked up this time, the CD was not bootable!
So tHe_sWeeper stepped in and made everybody happy.
Here it is, bootable and all!

Sorry, but Symantec has apparently decided to switch file-format.
So you will be having problem with old image made by earlier releaser.

And you will need to have .net installed.

All other questions are answered in tda's & ssg's infos.

:)
