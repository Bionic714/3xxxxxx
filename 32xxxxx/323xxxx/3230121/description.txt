 Army of Darkness Official Bootleg Edition (Anchor Bay) 
  
How can you destroy an army that's already dead
Listen up, you primitive screwheads!
At long last, here is the closest thing to an official Director's Cut of Army that you'll ever find. Personally, I think there is always merit in any version of a film that preserves what the makers intended. So, for your consideration, we submit the REAL film, complete with the original ending, which I think is far more appropriate.
On behalf of Sam Raimi and Robert Taperi, I'd like to thank all of you fans (you know who you are) for your loyal support of this ridiculous series of films - you are directly responsible for the demand to make this version available. May you revel in 96 minutes of excess and may you never run out of sugar… baby!
-Bruce Campbell
