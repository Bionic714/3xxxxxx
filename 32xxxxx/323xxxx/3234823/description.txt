With hundreds of all new morphs, in addition to the original Michael morphs, Michael 2.0 is the one of the most versatile models DAZ has ever created! This figure has 230 morphs in his head alone, and even more than that for his body, so the possibilities are truly infinite. With a little creativity and rendering time, Michael 2.0 can be any character you have ever dreamed of.
