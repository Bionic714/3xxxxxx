Bar-Kays - Soul Finger (1967).

11 songs - 42.9mb @ 192kbps CBR + covers and inlay.

The Bar-Kays were an aggregate born of the same inspiration behind Booker T. & the MG's -- performing the double-duty of being a backing combo for the significant canon of vocalists on the Memphis-based Stax and Volt labels, as well as a self-contained unit. The original lineup of James Alexander (bass), Jimmy King (guitar), Ronnie Caldwell (organ), Phalon Jones (sax), Carl Cunningham (drums), and Ben Cauley (trumpet) were only together long enough to have issued this album prior to the tragic loss of everyone sans Alexander and Cauley in the December '67 plane crash that also claimed the life of Otis Redding. - from AMG.
