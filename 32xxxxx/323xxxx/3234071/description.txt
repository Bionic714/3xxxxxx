Andy Lau is Hung Yan-Chau, a righteous crime boss who seems set for the night of his life. On one hand, his wife Emily (the long-missed Wu Chien-Lien), has just given birth to the couple's first child. On the other hand, there's a looming hit on Hung, which may be on the orders of one (or perhaps all) of Hung's lieutenants (Eric Tsang, Tsui Siu-Keung and Miu Kiu-Wai). However, the greatest threat may yet be Hung's right-hand man 
and best pal, Lefty (Jacky Cheung with nifty hair extensions), who threatens to take care of Hung's problems and even send him packing to New Zealand—that is, if Lefty has his way. Still, Hung wasn't born yesterday; clearly something's afoot, and he has his own cards to play. Meanwhile, young triad Yik (Shawn Yu) is angling 
to draw the plum hit assignment, and his best pal Turbo (Edison Chen) backs him up.
