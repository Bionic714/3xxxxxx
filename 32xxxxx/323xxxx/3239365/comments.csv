,ILoveLucy,2006-05-03T12:08Z,"Apologies for the flood. Apparently the database isn't designed to handle a message this long, so I'm going to have to break it up.

@shp0ngle:

The marketing hype for what you're describing is at http://www2.rosettastone.com/en/individuals/method

I haven't tried it yet, so I'll reserve judgement, but at first glance I think it's a good idea. Not every language has a direct correlation to English--ever heard the phrase ""lost in translation""?"
,ILoveLucy,2006-05-03T12:10Z,"The fact is, not only do languages have their own vocabulary and semantic structure, but they often have a different worldview and sharply contrasting ways of thinking. One of the most interesting examples is the Hopi language, which doesn't separate space and time every other language I know of. I can cite plenty of other examples, but typing in this little box is a pain in the arse."
,ILoveLucy,2006-05-03T12:11Z,"You should really just read ""Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Logic and General Semantics"" by Alfred Korzybski and ""Language, Thought, and Reality"" by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Science and Sanity will change your life.

Again, I haven't tried this (yet), but it seems like it could be a much more powerful, and accurate way of learning a language."
,jbardi,2006-09-16T05:36Z,"shp0ngle is an idiot.  If you need hand holding to know what the picture of a car is, or a girl throwing a ball, then you are a total moron.  You don't learn language by learning WORDS, but by learning the language RULES... sentence structure, gender reference, etc... the words you can learn with a english/japanese dictionary and fill them in correctly in proper SENTENCE structure.  I can tell you now, you will probably NEVER learn japanese because you don't have the mindset or understanding to learn a new language."
,DXMage,2006-10-10T18:26Z,Seed please
,phsyron,2007-04-13T05:00Z,"@ shp0ngle

that would defeat the purpose of the software. it tries to tap into your natural language aquisition abiliteis. if you associate the japanese word for woman with the english wor woman, you'll be translating english into japanese for the rest fo your life. if you assosciate it with a woman, you'll speak japanese."
,jg0123,2007-08-04T00:47Z,please more people seed!!!
