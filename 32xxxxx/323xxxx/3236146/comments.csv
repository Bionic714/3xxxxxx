,pros,2004-09-03T16:20Z,Does this RIP include the extra strip scene at the end of the original DVD movie?

The strip scene is in the begining of the movie. In the Dvd you get the same strip scene but longer and without the text as extras."
,pros,2004-09-03T17:46Z,"Well, Its not the same scene. The one at the end of the DVD is longer and contains more nudity :)

The ""real"" - longer, strip scene in other words not included?"

""MPAA: Rated R for strong sexuality..."" ;o)"
,pros,2004-09-04T12:22Z,Naked souls är faktiskt en hygglig film. Har den bara på VHS nånstans.. tror inte det är lönt att rippa den tyvärr :(

,TheWoddy,2006-10-15T13:23Z,I have the movie as a VHS rip incl. the trapez scene after the texts. I can put it up if anyone would be interested. I think the quality for a VHS rip is quite good. Let me know...
,fred.the.ungodly,2007-02-15T11:58Z,Does anyone know whether this movie was originally widescreen? (This version is 1.33:1)
