Alright here is a very rare Dead Kennedys pro shot show that was filmed by Channel 4 here in the UK as part of a program called "Whatever You Want", some of you may have seen some tracks from this show which were aired in 1982. Well now you can watch the whole show. I have also included an early Misfits show from 1982 so there is no wasted space when burned to CD, Enjoy!

Dead Kennedys Brixton Ace London 2nd December 1982 SVCD 74 minutes
Misfits Bethlehem Pennsylvania 31 October 1982 SVCD 29 minutes

These are in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to 2xCD's. They will play in most DVD players. They will fit on 2 80min blank cd-r using nero.
