,asphyxed,2012-02-17T10:43Z,"Thanks for this! I had a tape in '91, called American Power Hits 1991"", without a cover, so when internet came, i looked up lyrics but i still cant find 2 songs since then. One was female on side A, slow, tempo like ""keith whitley's I Wonder Do You Think of Me"", or Tracey Lawrence's ""I See It Now"", but wasnt country, more like a ballad. Chorus started with words somewhat like: ""Whatever happens, I will be standing here, whatever happens, ill dry your tears. This wont? be over, even if you say goodbye..."" and ended at: ""You cant tell a lie to the heart"". These lyrics arent on google, so if you know this song, please let me know..."
