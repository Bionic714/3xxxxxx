,EL_REY666,2005-06-21T18:42Z,"there is a problem after you install that it cant locate many things, including the bitmaps.... i have possibly solved this problem on my pc.  it will install this into your C: drive, but when you install it, install into program files, and it will make EGUITAR2 folder, and it will have alot of files all over the place in your programs folder.  you CANT copy them into the EGUITAR2 folder because it will not read them.

this was just an idea i had, maybe someone can do something better for all of us"
