OK here is New Bomb Turks from the Bizarre festival in 2000. This is an amazing band and an excellent set, if you don't know this band trust me and get it. I f you like fast punk rock and a manic frontman then this is for you. This is the usual high quality rip and i hope you enjoy it.

This is in SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.
