    Treehouse Of Horror 9 : A hell-raising hair-transplant turns harmless Homer into a homicidal
    hatchetman in Hell Toupee! A radioactive remote zaps Bart & Lisa into Itchy & Scratchy's cartoon
    universe, where the stakes are not only life and death, they're sharp and pointy! In The Terror
    of Tiny Town! Jerry Springer presides, as Kang, a drooling alien from Rigel 7, dukes it out with
    Homer over Maggie's paternity in Starship Poopers.

    The Cartridge Family : He who shoots first laughs best! Fearing for the safety of his family in
    the face of a soccer-inspired city-wide orgy of destruction, Homer buys a handgun. Fearing for
    the safety in the face of Homer's trigger-happy gun-crazed ways, the family flees. A merrily
    deranged and instructive tale of deadly force, common sense divorces and buyer's remorse.

    Natural Born Kissers : Rock the Casbah! While trying to jump-start the old marriage, Homer and
    Marge discover the exhilarating private rush of almost-public snuggling. No part of Springfield
    is off-limits in this hilariously shameful saga of prickly hay lofts, erotic holes of miniature
    golf, clothing-optional hot-air balloons, and spectator-filled stadiums!

    Grampa vs Sexual Inadequacy : This'll put the wowzers back in your trousers! The magnificent
    medicinal miracle of Grampa's Revitalizing Tonic saves Homer's marriage - but at what cost?!
    Thrill to the vibrating sarcophagus of the Pharaoh's Chamber! Witness the vengeful love between
    father and son! Drink a cheap substitute for holy water!
