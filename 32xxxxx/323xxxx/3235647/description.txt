<p>Alfa Romeo, Benetton, Brabham, BRM, Cooper, Ferrari, Lancia, Lotus, Maserati, Matra, McLaren, Mercedes 

Benz, Tyrrell, Vanwall and Williams. These are the constructors whose cars have either taken a driver to a 

world title or won a manufacturers championship during the first fifty years of Formula One. It is these 

marques which we pay tribute to in this unique overview of the evolution of the Grand Prix car. Looking at 

the legends of yesteryear with the aid of digital technology of today, we take a trip along the F1 timeline 

with the cars that made the champions. Exciting action and technical close-ups from modern events are 

blended with historical archive material to give you a better than ever before look at the great cars of 

Grand Prix racing. From Formula Oneâ€™s ancestors in the 1930s, right up to the technological marvels of 

today, the cars are the stars of the show! This memorable DVD also features extra info on 114 featured cars, 

F1 driver biographies and charts major milestones in F1 history. It also includes previously unseen footage 

and a classic F1 experience!<p/>
