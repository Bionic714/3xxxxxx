,Neverb0rn,2009-04-18T17:11Z,my dl hasnt completed yet but im dling it anyways because if you use vlc media player you can resync audio with like the h and j buttons or g and h. im not sure which but just google vlc audio sync commands and u'll find it. just use vlc to play them theyll probly be fine. vlc rox. thanks for the ul in advance. again i havent finished dl so when im done i'll comment on the quality.
,Neverb0rn,2009-04-18T17:14Z,also if you really dont like this copy of season five you can always dl the torrent with all oz seasons and just uncheck all but season 5. there are several complete oz collection torrents so if ur picky try that.
