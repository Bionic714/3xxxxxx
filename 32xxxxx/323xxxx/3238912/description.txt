Minutemen's Double Nickels on the Dime is a masterwork of American indie rock, a sprawling, 42-song explosion of terse, revolutionary rock'n'roll. Rifling through a kind of lurching punk-funk, this San Pedro, California, trio poses philosophical questions, mocks love-song clich√©s and Michael Jackson, covers CCR and Van Halen, and gets drunk on 'Jesus and Tequila'--all of it brought to life by the jazzy, popping bass of Mike Watt; the rifle-shot fills of drummer George Hurley, and the staccato guitar and impassioned cries of the late D. Boon, whose voice will forever insist: 'No hope? See, that's what gives me guts.' --David Cantwell
