*Kiss on the stomach-----""lets do it""
*Kiss on the Forehead ----""i hope we're together forever""
*Kiss on the Ear ---""I'm horny""
*Kiss on the Cheek ---""We're friends""
*Kiss on the Hand ---""I adore you""
*Kiss on the Neck ---""we belong together""
*Kiss on the Shoulder ---""I want you""
*Kiss on the Lips ---""I love you"" OR ""I want you""

What the gesture means...
*Holding Hands ---""we definitely love each other""
*Slap on the Butt ---""That's mine""
*Holding on tight ---""i don't want to let go""
*Looking into each other's Eyes ---""i just plain love you""
*Playing with Hair ---""Tell me you love me""
*Arms around the Waist ---""I love you too much to let go""
*Laughing while Kissing ---""I am completely Comfortable with you""
