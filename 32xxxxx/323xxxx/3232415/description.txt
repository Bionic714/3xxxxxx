Description: 

Total Textures v8 'Vehicles' is a collection of textures for 
applying to car models and scenes. The textures range from 
tyre bump maps to cool flame decals. In the case of textures 
such as decals, we have included the alpha-mapped TIFF files. 
Giving transparency to the outer edges of a map. 

For The first time on a Total Texture CD we have included 
.dxf meshes of some of the more 'common' car objects. 
These include Alloy Wheels, brake calipers, dials etc.
