,cup,2004-09-18T11:28Z,Can someone pls seed this?
,mammaspojke,2004-09-18T17:46Z,"how do you start this program, once you have it? i tried to burn it but i couldn't figure out how (i'm a rookie)"
,cpt_Kangaroo,2004-09-19T13:00Z,"Hi mammaspojke :)

Just open the ReadThisFirst.txt file in NotePad, and follow the instructions in there ;)"
,micleg,2004-12-12T19:43Z,I get checksum errors when extracting CD1. I guess I am the only one to have this problem since it has beed downloaded so many times. I will download it again.
,cpt_Kangaroo,2004-12-13T12:20Z,"Make sure you extract it with WinRAR version 3.30 or higher.

I also included an .sfv checksum checker - install wxChecksums (you can find it at www.Sourceforge.net). Open the .sfv with wxChecksums, and it will tell you if the files are intact or not. If a file fails the checksum, move the file out of the download folder, force a hash-recheck on the pieces (usually done automatically on restarting the torrent).  And restart the torrent, so it will redownload just that one file. "
,henrik1939,2004-12-19T10:09Z,"how come, when I install it. It return a lot of errors can't find alot of files in the ADTProgram FilesCommon FilesAutodesk SharedThumbnail. Hope you guys have a solution. I cant't find the files either that it request on the cd or in the image."
,cpt_Kangaroo,2004-12-19T14:57Z,"There is more than one CD image, so during the install, you have to unmount the first CD image and mount the second CD image. The way the install procedure lets you know, is by throwing an error in your face. This is not a nice way to let you know you need to change CDs, but that's how AutoDesk programmed the installer. All of the how-to-install notes can be found in the ReadThisFirst.txt file that I included in the torrent."
,nutterino,2005-02-05T23:57Z,"Great software thanks, looking for an add-on called   ""UK Content"", anyone have it?"
,Oddisabebe,2005-03-28T14:21Z,"I have typed the activation code got from the keygen, but the redistration wizard wont accept the code. Anyone else got this problem?"
,cpt_Kangaroo,2005-03-30T05:43Z,"(1)-- In the registration wizard, choose the ""Fax or Post/Mail"" option (do not choose the online activation option!). This will give you a page with a request code on it. 
(2)-- Copy the request code into the keygen. Make sure you don't accidentally add a space to the end if you copy/paste it, or make sure that the code is exactly the same (letter-CaPiTaLs) if you type it out.
(3)-- In the keygen, click on ""permanent"" for ""License behaviour"" and click on ""commercial"" for ""license usage of type"". The keygen will now give you an activation code.
(4)-- copy/paste that activation code into the registration wizard. Again make sure you don't accidentally add a space or press enter in the textbox where you pasted the activation code.

-----
It's possible that you may have to reinstall ADT2005 first if you accidentally used the online activation method previously. "
,cpt_Kangaroo,2005-04-08T17:05Z,"Note that ADT version 2006 (Magnitude release) has just appeared as well here on ThePirateBay, so new folks should download that version instead if they want the latest. 

For those still on this one, please help eachother complete as I no longer have it myself. "
,andhoff100,2005-05-11T13:01Z,Loaded o.k but can't find keygen. Please help
,cpt_Kangaroo,2005-05-11T16:06Z,"The keygen is in the keygen folder on CD1

If you used Daemon Tools or Alcohol120% to mount the CD-image, then you can browse to that folder in Explorer (like you would do with a real CD).

,Polstar,2008-10-07T17:29Z,"I have obtained the CDs from another source. They had the Keygen included. When i try and register it, it fails.
When i start the programe it gives me the options of;
Activate the Product 

OR

Run the product. 
I select Activate. Next the Options are;
Register and Activate

OR

Enter Activation Code.
I choose enter activation code. With the keygen open i tap in the Request code as displayed at the top of the ""Register Today"" dialogue box. The settings are as described in other comments below. License Behaviour = Permanent, License Usage = Commercial. I select my country (UK),then copy the Activation code into the Activation code box, hit next and it come up with ""There is a problem with the activation code you entered"". I have pick boxes for Try again and Contact Autodesk. Can anyone help figure out why this is not working for me?"
