A look at the nihilist rock n' roll forefathers of punk - Warhol & The Velvets, Iggy & The Stooges, MC5, Glam rock - Roxy, Bolan and Bowie - and the British Pub rockers and discover why they had such an impact on the young punks-to-be.

Programme 2: Year Zero

New York's punk scene developed from its roots in Warhol's Factory and The Velvet Underground through to the New York Dolls and venues like Max's Kansas City. We explore how the now legendary CBGB's evolved into a seminal punk club, playing host to the likes of Patti Smith, Blondie, Television, Talking Heads and The Ramones and how the New York scene informed the nascent London punks.
