Personally though, I find the material in these documentarys great, but the editing is fucking awful! This really is one of the worst examples of the ""MTV disease"" I have ever seen. Not one sinle clip is longer that 4 seconds and stupid, and non contributing, graphics flash past every 2 seconds. If you have seen the film ""Reality Bites"" you will know what I am talking about. ;-)

Anyway, it's simply annoying and a shame on the excellent material that they have dug up.
