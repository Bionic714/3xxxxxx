OK boys and girls here are two Snuff shows for you, the first one is one i filmed back in 96 and is definetly Snuff at their best. It has the keyboard player who is hilarious and still features Andy on bass. The next show is from the Bizarre Festival in 2000 and i had to cut the first show so that both would fit onto 2xcd's. Enjoy!
