Alright here is number two in what will be an ongoing series similar to my CD compilation series.

Here is a collection of punk bands from the 1970's BBC programme Top Of The Pops, this will take some back and for those outside of the UK should be a treat. I have enough for another 2 or 3 of these. They are in SVCD 1600kbps, enjoy!

This is in the cue & bin image format, i would recommend alcohol 120% for burning this as its the best image burner, but nero and others can do it.

If you want to extract the clips, use VCDGear as its the best for doing this.
