GAME INFORMATION:
 -------------------
 
  It's January 1967. After being drafted and completing basic training, you
  are plunged into the steamy jungles of Indochina. Heroic ideals of fighting
  for honor and country quickly fade in the face of the fierce warfare: there
  is no glory in death. 
 
  As a rookie soldier, you must quickly learn the finer arts of jungle and
  urban warfare to become a battle-hardened soldier and survive your first
  tour of duty. 
 
  Your Base Camp forms the central focus for your Operations, with your
  primary objective to pacify threats from the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese
  Army (NVA). You will need to venture deep into the hostile Vietnamese
  countryside to search out and destroy enemy troops and encampments. With
  visibility low, potentially every bush and tree could be an enemy-hiding
  place. Only by careful observation and hastily learnt war craft shall the
  enemy be overcome.
