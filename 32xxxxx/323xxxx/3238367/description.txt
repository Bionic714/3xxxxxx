It. crime/horror/thriller 1987

A young opera singer gets her big chance when the previous star of a production of Verdi's Macbeth is run over by a car. Convinced the opera is bad luck she accepts, and becomes the target (in Argento's unmistakable style) of a psychopath - a man she has been dreaming of since childhood.

DVD5-source, nothing ripped or shrunk

No other subs were included on disc apart from the aforementioned, so there's no point in asking for it.

Normally I would shout "Say no to dubbing" and leave only one audiotrack, but this movie uses both English and Italian, so that just wouldn't be right.

Enjoy!
