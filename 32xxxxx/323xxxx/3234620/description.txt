Lite info från konvolutet:
  This LP marks the highlight in the career of a talanted Nordic blond vocalist - Doris Svensson from Gothenburg, Sweden. It seems as though she's finally managed to find and record a set of songs that suit her 100%. Maybe this isn't surprising when you consider the musical genius that went into writing and scoring the album. Most of the material was written and arranged by TV producer, jazz-pianist, composer, "rarely-out-of-the-news-man-about-town" Berndt Egerbladh. Lyrical assistance was generously provided by a 6 foot kiltless Scottish giant, Francis Cowan. Francis also plays the cello on a few tracks which explains why he's kiltless. Anyway, quite a combination which gave a fantastic result, with a little help from producer, Håkan Sterner. Incidentally, Håkan found the job so exciting that he was forced to retreat behind a beard after it's completion.
  Doris' album provides 36 minutes of qualified musical joy guaranteed to satisfy all tastes. Discotheques will find that two numbers in particular, "Don't" and "Beatmaker" are good box office draws. Jazz die-hards might even start visiting discothequesa after digesting "I Wish I Knew" and "I'm Pushing You Out". Note too an incredible ballad called "Daisies" and tell me if Sweden hasn't produced a dangerous competitor for Melanie.
  Once again, this LP's got something for everybody, the best of underground, jazz, rock and folk - not mixed up in one gigantic hotch-potch, but all in gentle harmony. Listen to Doris - a good time will be had by all.
