Alright here is a cracker for all you ghouls out there...

The Misfits live at the Bradford Rios in england, this is a superb multi camera pro shot video. Any Misfits fan will be over the moon but also if you just like good gigs then this one is for you.

Also the amazing Why Be Something Your Not Detroit cale show from 1981 in incredible quality. So you get Glen Danzig and Micheal Graves in one post....
