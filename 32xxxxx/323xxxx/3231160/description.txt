BrainWave Generator is a brain stimulation application that works by
generating binaural beat frequencies. With binaural beats, you can
stimulate your brain to make yourself relaxed, help in meditation or
self-hypnosis, enhance learning capabilities, induce sleep, help
focusing attention, and so on.

BrainWave Generator works on Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT.
