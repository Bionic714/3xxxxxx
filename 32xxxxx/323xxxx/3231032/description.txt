In the near future, Japan is ruled once more by a monarchy. But, 
rebels opposed to this rule seek to overthrow the government. The 
House of Takemikazuchi, a band of assassins is hired by the 
government to suppress the rebels. As a conspiracy from within 
signals the shadowy organization's impending demise, Yuki, the 
last of the Takemikazuchi bloodline befriends one of the rebels 
and seeks revenge against the group's leader.
