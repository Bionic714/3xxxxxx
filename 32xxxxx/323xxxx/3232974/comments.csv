,pandillo,2011-10-24T06:29Z,"""Oceania"" and ""Submarine"" are the best songs fucker...        ""He lives in Louth, Lincolnshire and he has equipment in his bedroom where he records himself and his albums. We brought a G4 and Pro Tools and recorded it in one afternoon. He's such an extraordinary singer. Before he left, he insisted to give us a scale of his voice, where he sings all the tones â€“ and he has the most amazing range, like 5 or 6 octaves. What's really interesting about his range is that each octave is of a totally different character. We actually ended up using that later for ""Oceania"", we used what he calls the 'Wyattron'."" â€” BjÃ¶rk, Xfm, 25 August 2004"
