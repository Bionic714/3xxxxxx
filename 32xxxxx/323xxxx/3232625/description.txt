Ultimate Spinach - Ultimate Spinach (1967).

9 songs - 49.9mb @ 192kbps CBR.

Stunning debut album from the Boston band. This classic of 1968 psychedelia includes the songs "Ego Trip" and the rightfully legendary "(Ballad of The) Hip Death Goddess". Wonderous summery, tripped out shimmering psych melting into wah-wah fuzz guitars, vocal harmonies and druggy lyrics...

enjoy and seed :]
