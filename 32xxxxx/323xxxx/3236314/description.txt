I have become some what of a Metallica fan in recent days but when I heard St.Anger album I as a audiophile got real mad. I never heard such sound grose quality from a so big band. So this is a harsh remake of St.Anger and I might add that most modification has been done to Ulrich drums, they were totaly out of line, what was Bob Rock thinking?
Now Hefield,Hammet & Rock have a bigger part in the songs, not just Ulrich drums everwhere.

I'm not know to making rip albums but I had no choice here.
But it's sort of a custom release, cause the songs are not originals anymore.
