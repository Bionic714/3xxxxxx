- You must definitely be a retard! Metallica is nowadays as far away from their roots as it's possible to be. They're a four-piece of nu-metal faggots! Touring with Linkin' Park on top of it all. How lame can they actually be? Seems like that's become a challenge for them..."
,AudiophileSD,2004-09-05T23:09Z,"I agree, Metallica is not anywhere their roots with St.Anger."
