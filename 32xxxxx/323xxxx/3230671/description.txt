Outlaw Volleyball combines the fun gameplay of Virtua Tennis 2K2 with 
 the outrageous humor of Outlaw Golf and South Park. The game is sand 
 volleyball in 16 different environments featuring 16 characters, each 
 of whom are available as teammates or opponents. Feel the action as
 you Spike or Die with fabulous babes and guys with attitude. Up to 
 four people can compete as they dive, spike, jump and lob the ball 
 for total victory. Play well and your team will gain momentum, play
 badly and so will your team. It's Hot Babes! Hot Spikes! Hot Sand!
