9 songs - 62.8mb @ --alt-preset extreme (High VBR).
Ripped and cleaned with Wavelab and encoded with lame-3.90.3

Funky Nassau by these Bahamas natives is one of my most treasured albums. Funky Nassau Pt. 1 is a real monster, every time you play it the dancefloor litteraly exploads :], Come Down holds it's own as well. The last track When She Made Me Promise is a nice jamming session.
 The nine cuts fuses island rhythms and American jazz/funk into a very nice mixture, featuring guitars, bass, drums, horn section and scratch vocals. Altough they are sometimes misclassified as a disco band, I promise you this is NOT disco hehe.

This is a vinyl rip, so you might expect some hiss and pops. Although I've tried to clean it up, you can't get all of it out.

enjoy and SEED! :]
