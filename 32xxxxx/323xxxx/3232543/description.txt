Mega rare late '60s UK psych with an early Floyd/Caravan/Arzachel feel. Excellent freaky, fuzz n' wah-wah guitar with swirling keyboards and a classic '60s production loaded with all of the studio effects of the era. A bit of a gem.

This is not porn boys and girls :] just so you know hehe.

enjoy and keep it seeded :]
