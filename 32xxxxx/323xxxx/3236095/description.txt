Castle Siege: Ballerburg takes you back to an era of castles, knights and 
crucial battles fought with cannons, catapults and magic spells - a time when
ruling a kingdom was a daily battle for survival. In this humor-filled story,
you mastermind the action as a general who has been ordered by his queen 
to get rid of her hated sisters in neighboring settlements. Both you and your 
human or AI opponents have your own castles. Inside or around the castles you 
can also erect additional buildings and repair any damage to them as your power 
increases, giving you more weapons and magic.
