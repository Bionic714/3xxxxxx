,mrdunworthy,2006-10-28T23:46Z,"2+ years in the air, 7900+ downloads and still breathing. Not many torrents can do *that*. Thanks tomervini -- Quality stuff!"

Thanx m8."
,zorchon,2007-05-31T17:21Z,"Important information for those Interested:
  the 81 ""Books"" are dirictions for only 81 MODELS. It is NOT a collection of every Origami book released in the last decade.
  Beyond that information, I can inform all that the models range from super easy to decently challanging, (I'm a folding addict, and have not yet found a model I couldn't make.)
  So from my viewpoint: Some good fun here, but two thirds too dull to even look at."
,abisurd,2007-08-05T06:05Z,"81 Origami models, not 81 books.
But the models are well documented, hence making it easy for novices and intermediate users.
Good job."
