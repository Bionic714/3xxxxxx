,Fornic8R,2005-06-12T11:58Z,"Why are'nt these all ripped at 192kbps or better? 128kbps sounds terrible on some of them - play a 192kbps version and THEN listen to the 128kbps version... BAD BAD BAD. Not that I do not appreciate the download, but 128kbps is terrible quality..."
,beachside777,2006-12-21T06:27Z,"Thanks. By the way, these are all ripped at 160 kbps."
,denman123a,2007-03-12T08:03Z,"160's just fine, thanks. 128's good too and is about the best compromise between quality and file size, not-to-mention D/L time. Many thanks 99!"
