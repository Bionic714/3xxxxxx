Hi
Here is an excellent show Green Day from 1991, this is a very rare version of this show as its in stereo and shot from the back. There is a version from the stage in circulation which isn't complete and not very good. Whereas this is filmed great, the camera is on a tripod and has lots of close-ups not just static. If this is popular i might post some more Green Day live shows. Enjoy!
