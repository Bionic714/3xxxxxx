Osibisa - Woyaya (1971).

7 songs - 75.3mb @high VBR.
Ripped and cleaned with WaveLab and encoded with lame-3.90.3 --alt-preset extreme. Vinyl rip so expect some hiss and pops.

The exellent followup to their selftitled debut album.
if you enjoyed my latest Osibisa offering you won't be dissapointed.
a great mix of funk/jazz7world beat.
think happy thoughts and enjoy this album.
