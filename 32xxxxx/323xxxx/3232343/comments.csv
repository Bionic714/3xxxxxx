,sparky415,2008-07-23T02:27Z,"Nice, thanks."
,wtfseed,2008-12-04T01:32Z,"shit video quality, looks like a youtube upload"
,mucky37,2009-01-27T21:42Z,"Video quality looks fine to me. Good brightness and contrast, clear and sharp. No motion artfacts that I could see. The only pixellation I saw was the camouflage fatigues around the 58 minute mark. 

Video is 640x352 DX50. The audio figures are not great, only 31 kb/s, so it might not stretch your 5.1 home system, but it sounds ok.

Thanks for uploading."

,jackandbudlight,2009-12-26T18:38Z,"To: wtfseed

This movie is from the late 80's. Get a Grip. 
Thats still the vhs era. Hard to digitally remaster something that old. 20 years ago. "

,JONBOY179,2012-06-09T00:29Z,too slow for me nice try thanks any way
,Perlimpimpim,2012-08-24T20:15Z,Very poor quality. Hardly a dvdrip/XviD as it was stated. The fact it's from 1986 serves no excuse for it also. Really was a waste of time downloading this. Sorry.
