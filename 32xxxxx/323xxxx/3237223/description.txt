Here is a collection of punk bands from the 1970's BBC programme Top Of The Pops, this will take some back and for those outside of the UK should be a treat. I have enough for another 2 or 3 of these. They are in SVCD 1600kbps, enjoy!

This is in the cue & bin image format, i would recommend alcohol 120% for burning this as its the best image burner, but nero and others can do it.
