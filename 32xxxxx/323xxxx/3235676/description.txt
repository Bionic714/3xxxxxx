Gameinfo:
On a warm evening in May 1897, Sherlock Holmes, accompanied by Dr. Watson
arrives at a party in the fabulous Sherringford Hall. It was rumoured that
the host, Sir Melvyn Bomsby, a construction tycoon was to make an
announcement of great importance concerning the future of his business.
 
At 11PM people began to crowd around the bar in anticipation as Sir Bromsby
and his chief associate Hermann Grimble took to the stage. Barely had he
begun to welcome his guests when Sir Bromsby fell to the floor, a darkening
red stain visible on his tuxedo right above his heart...
 
Holmes decides not to wait for police before beginning his investigation.
 
The game is afoot.
