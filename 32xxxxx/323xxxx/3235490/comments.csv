Here's a sample from the one I have:

Is the quality of yours much better?"
,matt0t3,2004-08-30T22:46Z,"These are not great, but are the best available releases until the DVD-rips come out (trust me, I've been looking).  The files are almost all Divx3, 320x240, 600-800 kbps.  The one with french subtitles is Divx4, 380x288, but has the french subs.  I only included it because the other version of 4x01 is REALLY bad.

The Season 5 I'm going to upload soon is more of the same, but like I said, the best available right now (and much better than the 200MB mpegs and 90MB asfs floating around).  Season 6 is much better (640x480 Divx5)."
,Mindbomb,2004-08-31T18:19Z,Thank you Matt!

,hasvedi,2004-09-02T11:42Z,"Jag fick ""Felaktig kotrollsumma"" på allt jag laddade ned. Så slängde jag hela skiten, laddade en ny torrent från den här sidan, och började om. Samma sak.""Felaktig kotrollsumma"". Vad håller ni på med egentligen? Jag kör Azureus 2.1.0.4."
,matt0t3,2004-09-02T13:07Z,no idea what that says.. anyone wanna translate?
,hasvedi,2004-09-02T17:07Z,"Sorry! I said _ I keep getting ""hash fails"" on everything I download here. I tried chucking everything out, downloading a new torrent from this page and starting over again. It did not help! I use Azureus 2.0.1.4."
,matt0t3,2004-09-02T18:30Z,"There may be clients within the torrent that are sending bad data.  Depending on your client (I know that the feature exists within ABC and BitTornado), there may be an option to bad users that send bad data, so you don't communicate with them in future.  Try that.  If it doesn't work, I don't really have any other ideas.  Other users seem to be getting the torrent without problems."
,matt0t3,2004-09-02T18:31Z,"damn typos... that should have read ""option to BAN users that send bad data""..."
,spec,2004-09-08T18:07Z,Thank you very much for seeding these seasons

,freakling,2005-01-21T07:57Z,I will add a torrent for 401 once I get the dvd. Should come out the same quality or better though I will be using DivX 5.2. Stay tuned!
