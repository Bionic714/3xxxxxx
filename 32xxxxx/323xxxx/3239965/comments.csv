,Mordoc,2004-09-19T11:24Z,Are you compleatly out of your mind? adding something to suprnova is the same as lett the leachers take all our bandwich!
,NFFC,2004-09-19T11:34Z,"well sorry! lol

most files on here get uploaded to suprnova anyway, like 4.5GB DVDr's so i doubt a 1MB prog will take down the site

it also helps more people get the program

and also helps it stay alive much longer because more people get it"

Upload succesfull: the tracker that hosts your torrent has been designated as ""inactive"", probably because it temporarily unavailable. Your torrent will be placed on hold till it is up again.
MsgCode: suprnova::add_torrent::inactive_tracker::2314

From what I've seen, it can take a while for SN to remove a tracker from inactive status, so cross your fingers!

Oh, and thanks! ;)"
,TEA-Time,2004-09-19T22:41Z,"Wow, that was quick.  It's already been approved and is being listed, so they must have the tracker status as back online also."
