,thedaddy24,2006-01-29T08:48Z,"top notch download; just burn and play baby:-)

if you have no CD's then just use Alcohol 120% to boot it on a virtual drive. the no cd patch can be found at:

(for UK)

thanks:-)

,prophet1981,2006-04-04T02:42Z,"Hi everyone,

Using daemon tools, I'm able to locate the Chessmaster_10th_Edition Rar file in my download directory. Three folders appear when I click on the rar file: CD1, CD2, and CD3.  When I select the CD1 folder, however, daemon tools does not appear to recognize any of its contents (i.e. it is completely empty), and so I'm unable to highlite the vng-c10a.r file to begin the install.  All the contents are present and accessible when viewed using the C drive, therefore I know the download was completed successfully. The solution is probably something quite obvious to a seasoned computer user, but it has eluded me to this point.  If you have even the remotest inkling of what might be causing this nuisance, I would really appreciate you sharing it with me.  I'm experiencing a similar problem with Swat 4. Help me, and I promise to repay you in kind. Thanks in advance."
,andysterdam,2006-04-20T17:20Z,"thedaddy24--thanks so much for posting the patch! it worked like a charm, and got rid of the cd-rom warning when chessmaster starts. i suggest everyone download this patch. it works wonders!!! thanks again!"
,bonkers12345,2006-04-22T08:12Z,where is the install file? i need help?
,Xcessivenz,2006-06-29T10:52Z,Unpack the rar file with Winrar and then click on the cue image file to burn three CD's with Nero. Works great and there is a crack on the first CD so you don't need to have the CD in the drive to make it work.  
,silenius,2006-07-18T00:54Z,"Great game for chess lovers, it'll surely increase your chess skills, much worth the download, and working perfectly so far, just burn the 3 images with Nero ( I used Nero 7), and install with crack, and enjoy it. Thnx ABZeta"
,rrowdies,2006-07-30T20:05Z,Thanks very much to all you seeders out there.
,rrowdies,2006-08-01T23:20Z,"Thanks thedaddy24 for posting that patch link. My game wouldn't load, caused my PC to freeze so bad I had to unplug it. After I threw out the CDs I remembered the patch. Voila! It works great!
Thanks again to all you seeders, without which we wouldn't have these great games!"
,bejko,2006-08-31T16:09Z,.r34 from CD1 is damaged!

,sank22,2007-04-09T06:18Z,"After I installed Chess Game & I copy file called ""game"" from crack directory  the main Executable file directory. I am able to start the Chess application.

,sherryptk,2007-04-14T16:55Z,"I have the same problem as sank22.  Everything seems to be working fine until the introduction is over.  Then a little clock starts ticking, disappears, and the screen is black.  Anyone know what's going on?

Thanks so much."

,atangba,2008-10-09T18:22Z,"how do u burn it on a CD, after unpacking the rar file the size is too big it doesnt fit on a single CD...i got two files here .bin and .cue, m i doing sumthng wrong.. help guys."
,spac3m3nt,2008-11-21T10:28Z,"First off, fast download.

FOR PEOPLE WITH PROBLEMS:

1. When you download you will have three folders. Select all three folders and extract them by using WinRar. Extract them to any folder (ex. my documents.)  This folder will now show 6 items.  There will be two files for each CD. DON'T BOTHER trying to burn them, disc 1 WON'T fit onto a CD.

2. Download the free trial of Daemon tools. Install and run this program. You will notice there is a small icon for it by the clock on your taskbar.  Right click on this icon and select whatever the top option is, I forget what it says.  Then click ""Mount Image.""  What you will then do is select the first item in the folder with the 6 items. (What you are essentially doing is installing Disc1.)  When that is through, it will tell you to insert Disc2, so you repeat what I wrote above, only you ""Mount Image"" for the next file from that folder.

3.  NOW. Go to ""My Computer,"" and select the disk drive that will now be showing a picture of ChessMaster (your CD drive.)  Right click on it and select ""Explore.""  Open the folder titled ""Crack.""  In it will be an .exe file called ""Game.""

4.  Right click on Game.exe and click ""copy.""  

5.  Go to where the game is saved, which is probably something like ""C:\Users\*your_username*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Ubisoft.""  It doesn't particularly matter, it's just wherever your programs are usually installed to.  Wherever it is, it will be in a folder called ""Ubisoft.""  Now open the Ubisoft folder and open the next folder ""Chessmaster 10th Edition.""

6.  In that folder, DELETE the .exe program that is already there. PASTE the ""game.exe"" file you copied in step 4 into this folder.

7.  Now you're done. You can click on that .exe file to start your game!  Note: if you want, just right click and make that into a shortcut for your desktop.



It literally took me about 5 hours to get there by myself after sorting through all of these comments.  I ran into a million errors.  With this, it should only take you a few minutes.  Good luck, and remember to SEED, don't be an asshole."
,sali77,2008-11-21T19:53Z,"What is the version?
Uk/US/EU?"
,spac3m3nt,2008-11-21T23:23Z,"v1.0.0

don't know if that's US/UK/ or other"
,sgtpepperi,2010-10-27T09:04Z,"When I'm installing the CD1 via MagicISO, becomes: ''Error 1305. Error reading from file E:\Support\Register\dll\xmltok.dll.
Verify that the file exists and that you can access it.''

What do I do now?"
,PawnPush,2010-11-03T11:02Z,"For the persons getting errors this might help. First of all use Daemon Tools instead of Power ISO and secondly, when on the start-up scrren for the program uncheck ""Download Direct X..."".

Doing these two things solved the problems I had with errors. Also the crack files mentioned is on the first CD (CD1)."
,mudbone32,2011-09-11T16:09Z,"I keep getting ""failed to attach personality"" msg whenever I try to play...any ideas? thanks!"
,vangelemperor,2011-10-21T21:30Z,"Hi spac3m3nt, everything is fine with your instruction for installation till the moment i have to right click the chessmaster icon and choose ""explore"", the thing is that there is no option to choose ""explore"". If I choose ""open"" there is no any folder ""crack"". I use windows 7 ultimate, what is the problem?
I would be glad if anyone can help,
best regards"
