If you have their other cds and, like me, simply CANNOT get enough, well, then, YES, you DO need to get this CD. 4 terrific rockers, 1 slow soulful, 1 (maybe)gospel-rock, and 1 that defies description (Insane Asylum has a male vocal until Rachel chimes in as powerfully as usual)

I made a "Best of" cd for my car stereo and picked 5 of these 7; not a bad payoff for the purchase (and then stuck the other 2 songs on at the end, anyway!)

Original? Maybe not very, but high-quality, rootsy rocky R&B doesn't need to be. It just has to be good and sincere. This is.
Only seven songs, but enough variation on the album. And all songs are more than 'okay'.
A short album, but fortunately there's a 'repeat-button'on my CD player.
