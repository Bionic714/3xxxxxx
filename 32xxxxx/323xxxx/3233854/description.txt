Album Description:
Four CD box-set features 95 digitally remastered tracks that represent the most comprehensive collection yet of Marley's recordings from the late 60's & early 70's, which many consider his most creative period. The set's lavishly illustrated, 44 page color book contains detailed track by track commentary, along with an authoritative introduction to the background to the music scene in Jamaica at the time. Each of the themed discs have been carefully sequenced for listening purposes. The first two discs gather predominantly rastafarian reggae, whilst the third & fourth discs comprise titles with their roots in gospel, spirituals, soul & folk rock. Packaged in a digibook (approx. 5.5 x 10 inches). 2001.
