This Hong Kong martial-arts extravaganza tells of evil emperors and true love. Father Fong belongs to the Red Lotus Flower Society, which is committed to the overthrow of the evil Manchu Emperor and his minions. One of his Governors is sent on a mission to retrieve a list of members of that secret society. Meanwhile, a subplot involves Fong's son, Fong Sai-Yuk, who falls in love with the beautiful daughter of a rich merchant, recently moved to Canton. Her father, in an attempt to gain influence in the region and thus improve his business, offers his daughter in marriage to the winner of a kung-fu contest.
