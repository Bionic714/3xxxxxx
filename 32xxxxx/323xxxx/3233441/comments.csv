,saamoa,2004-12-01T11:56Z,"does anyone know how and have the time to set up a bittorrent tracker? I have been thinking that it could be cool to make a tracker that specialize in alternative music, such as coil, current 93, NWW etc"

and pt 2"
,phasmatrope,2005-03-17T03:13Z,"Man, I gave up on this torrent a long time ago, why is it still up?? Doesn't anyone here speak Swedish who can post an inquiry or complaint about it for the forums or admins? This is frickin' ridiculous...."
