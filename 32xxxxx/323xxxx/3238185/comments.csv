,fletchdaf,2004-09-16T18:48Z,"=== >>> ""his superhuman achievements"" <<< ===

Exactly what superhuman achievements did this self-indulgent and self-centered scoundrel achieve?  A retreat house that was shut down by the local authorities because it was so unsanitary?  How about not being a father the the two children by two different women he sired?

This individual was hardly a great achiever, and to assert such is historical recidivism at its worst.

Thou art emphatically my chosen; and blessed are the eyes that thou shalt look upon with gladness. But I will hide thee in a mask of sorrow: they that see thee shall fear thou art fallen: but I lift thee up.

54. Nor shall they who cry aloud their folly that thou meanest nought avail; thou shall reveal it: thou availest: they are the slaves of because: They are not of me. The stops as thou wilt; the letters? change them not in style or value!

55. Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet; thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto.

56. Begone! ye mockers; even though ye laugh in my honour ye shall laugh not long: then when ye are sad know that I have forsaken you.""

,Krank-mma,2005-06-15T04:27Z,"Call him self-endulgent or whatever - he still gifted the world with many an interresting thought. He has inspired many a people, and created a stir in society. Also, he pissed off a lot of childish bastards, and showed the finger to a lot of bollicks-morals - which I respect. Each man and woman is a star - we don't need order, structure, socirty or any of that crap. We are all gods."
