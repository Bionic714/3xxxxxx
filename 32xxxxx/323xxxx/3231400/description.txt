Description:

	Hunter: The Reckoning returns to the Xbox with even 
   more frenetic multi-player action than the original game. 
   Based on the gothic fantasy world of White Wolf's pen and 
   paper RPG system, players act as human monster-hunters 
   combining melee, ranged and spell-driven attacks. In 
   Hunter: The Reckoning - Redeemer, the hunt continues as a 
   new Hunter joins the original team of 4 in their fight to 
   save the citizens of Ashcroft from a twisted plot to take 
   over the innocent town. Players battle against hordes of 
   supernatural enemies in single-or multi-player mode - they 
   do whatever it takes to get the job done.
