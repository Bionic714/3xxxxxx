Here's a high quality show of Rancid. This is my own rip as usual, just to let you kmow as i know theres a lot of "Rockpalast" stuff floating about. This is the full show, there was a shorter version shown before this one.

Rancid-Loreley Festival Germany 20-6-1998 SVCD 36 minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. This will fit on a 80min blank cd-r using nero.
