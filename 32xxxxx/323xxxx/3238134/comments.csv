,cheetohman,2005-08-08T04:14Z,"Answered my own question.  For those like me, you must extract ALL of the zip files at the same time. (highlight them all, right click, and extract)  Then find the extracted  file ending with 001 and double click on it, and the nero install program starts.  By the way, Murdock, Thank you for the torrent."
