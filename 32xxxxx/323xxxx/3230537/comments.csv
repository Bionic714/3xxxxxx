,CsMbI,2004-08-10T22:05Z,"Patches just fine to v1.35, however I could not find a serial that is not banned yet.
NE1 has a serial that would work on the expansion pack with the 1.35 patch?
Thanks."
,Trichem,2004-08-11T10:03Z,anyone got it worked yet?
,CsMbI,2004-08-11T13:29Z,"Yup. It installs, I can patch it, it starts. All just fine.
I don't have a serial number though. :-)"
,Trichem,2004-08-11T16:14Z,how did u burn it? with what program
,CsMbI,2004-08-11T18:31Z,"Read the success story.
Make CCD image, patch it, then burn the patched image with alcohol.
That's it."
,vnenkov,2004-08-12T19:03Z,"Help!!!
How burn .bwa file?
With what program?
10x."
,ugnip,2004-08-12T22:12Z,I used blind write as told..but it says my serial is wrong..suggestions on what serial to use? tried 4 different now:(
,CsMbI,2004-08-12T22:55Z,"vnenkov, read the success story. It describes how.
ugnip, all serials i know are blacklisted - need to find new ones."
,Something,2004-08-15T08:20Z,"I burnt and installed it and everything works...however to play the game I require a non-blacklisted CD-Key/Serial!

Does anyone have a working one? or a possible way around the problem?"
,Lindstedt,2004-08-25T05:34Z,Is this an Expansion ONLY or a seperate game?
,CsMbI,2004-08-26T17:17Z,"If it asks for serial number, then You are thru the disk check already - successful burn, congrats!
You need to use the serial number from the original spellforce. As the new patches come more and more publicly available serials have been blocked.
I did not install the 1.35 patch (using the original unpatched expansion here), and I found a working serial number on the emule network. You might want to search for those as well - if You post those, then probably those will be blacklisted soon as well."
,CsMbI,2004-08-26T17:19Z,"Lindstedt, expansion only. You will need the original game as well (e.g. NOT standalone)."
,clo-25,2004-08-27T04:22Z,well can i find this success story?
,fsdf,2004-08-29T16:16Z,"Can someone PLEASE tell me how you are supposed to fit the image on a 80min CD??  The base image file is over 800 megs, and the patched image file is over 900 megs.  How are you supposed to burn this to CD??  I followed the instructions in the success story exactly.."
,CsMbI,2004-08-29T20:52Z,"Read the success story how. It is described there. No guarantee that it will work for You though, so be sure to use a CD-RW first."
,fsdf,2004-08-29T20:58Z,"Yeah, but it doesn't mention anything about burning a 950 meg patched image to a 700mb cd..."
,Herman666,2004-08-30T10:17Z,"fsdf, there are CD-Rs with higher capacity than 700 MB.
I just bought today CD-R that (supposedly) is 870 MB/99 min. I know that 800 MB also exist. Try to find something like this. 
Unfortunately, I cannot tell you how to burn Breath of Winter image, because I'm still downloading the torrent. I'm behind firewall (can't do anything about it) and sometimes it takes ages..."
,CsMbI,2004-08-31T23:52Z,"It fits to the 700 mb CD. There is a lot of extra sector info data added to the image, but it's still a 80 min CD. Just follow the guide. If You have the same burner, it will work."
,lillematte,2004-09-16T21:21Z,"I dont get it at all. what is this with

,NyteBlade,2004-09-17T02:58Z,"order of dawn is the original game, breath of winter is the expansion. you MUST have order of dawn installed to play this.. IF you can get this to install *sigh*"
,Aleco,2004-10-04T13:24Z,"Hello! Can someone please give me a serial key so that I can install breath of winter.. Ive been looking for ages now, please help me"

but it cannot work. when i start the game, it says
game cannot start because i am using a backup copy of the original disk. it asked me to insert the original disk.

,5P1D3R,2007-01-24T20:42Z,"Enter gamecopyworld.com... write spellforse & search... and then look at the 1.52a nocd fix..
first install the game, add the addon(Breath of Winter or the other one... they both work), use the pach 1.52a and copy the file in the arhive( that you d/l from the site) in the main folder. That is all.

I didn't test but... i'm sure it will work"
