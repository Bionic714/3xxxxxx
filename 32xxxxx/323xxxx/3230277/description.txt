Game Information ..:  

      Get ready to unleash the power, the speed, the heart stopping, gear 
      mashing, engine screaming action of MX Unleashed! Go bar to bar against 
      the top champions in the world with physics so real that you'll feel as 
      though you are three stories high clearing a triple, whipping your bike 
      around a corner to take the lead, or thrown like a rag doll as you 
      accelerate over the whoops. Prepare yourself for mud, dirt, high 
      speeds, and serious attitude. Rainbow Studios, the masters of off road 
      racing games, returns to their heritage to bring the definitive next 
      generation MX game to life.
