Previously released in limited quantity on the 3" cd that came with Ultravisitor, track 1 is a head-down stepper with a compulsive, twitching raggafied bassline, breaks and big sirens going off all the way through... Track 2 is the Acid Mix of the same track, tweaked and mashed into something new... Track 3 "Tundra 4" was previously unveiled during the Sinfonietta tour back in April, reworking and extending the all-time classic "Tundra" from the debut album 'Feed Me Weird Things' into an epic of orchestral strings and firing amens.
