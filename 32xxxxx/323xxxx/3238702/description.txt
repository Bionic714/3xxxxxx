The Outsiders - C.Q. (1968).

18 Tracks - 76mb @ 192kbps CBR + cover and inlay.

The legendary psych album by this Dutch band from the late sixties that's often mentioned in the same breath as Group 1850's Agemo's Trip. Renowned for conjuring up psychedelic beat music and punky garage pop the outsiders entered the spirit of '68 with an album that is seemingly filled with a hard edged, dark atmosphere of trippy paranoia. The CD features five bonus tracks

enjoy and SEED!! :]
