Nothing like a lot of gratuitous nudity and gore every now and then and this Category III flick has plenty. A serial killer/rapist (Mark Cheng) is on a killing spree in HK and he has a particular liking for ladies with nice legs; unfortunately for them - preferably detached from the rest of their body. Psychopath Roy Chen Chih-lai (Mark Cheng Ho-nam) is abducting women, raping them, and slicing off their legs. He then wraps the severed limbs in plastic and hangs the trophies from his ceiling. After witnessing policewoman Cheng Hsuen (Jade Leung Ching) battling armed killers, Chen begins stalking her and even starts secretly living in the woman's apartment. After brazenly announcing his presence, he kidnaps and rapes Hsuen's sister, Kelly (Japanese porn star Miho Nomoto, known in Cantonese as Ching Kar-mei), and uses the girl to lure Hsuen into a trap. Hsuen is able to escape but falls into another trap and accidentally kills her boyfriend (Michael Tse Tin-wah). Suspended from the force, Hsuen seeks vengeance, as Chen's insane acts even extend to mutilating her fiance's corpse and threatening her aged mother.
