,double_b26,2007-11-18T06:22Z,"this is an awesome album.  too bad the singer got killed before they could make more.  anyway, can anyone comment on the quality.  i have this already but the quality isnt the greatest and a song (#8 i think) cuts off in the middle.  is this one any different???"
,krankjorem,2008-01-29T19:03Z,"super, love to see this classic here.
i lent it to a friend, never saw it back. bugger.
