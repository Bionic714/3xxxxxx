Monty.Python.Live.at.the.Hollywood.Bowl.1982.DVDRip.XviD-MDX

This is a very funny 1982 concert film of the Monty Python comedy troupe---Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin---performing some of their best known comedy sketches live at the Hollywood Bowl, such as Dead Bishop On The Landing, Nudge Nudge, Silly Walks, Argument Clinic, and The Lumberjack Song, to name but a few. There are also some new sketches, such as Four Yorkshiremen and One-Man Wrestling that are just as funny as the classics. Also, the Pythons get fine support from resident Python babe Carol Cleveland, and singer/musician Neil Innes. A hilarious, must-see film for Python fans
