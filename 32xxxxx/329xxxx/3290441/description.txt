There were five on her list. Now it's three. O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green were         
the first to fall, now The Bride (Uma Thurman) is out to finish the job by killing      
Elle Driver, Budd, and last of all, Bill (David Carradine). If the final three aren't   
afraid now, they better start, because she's coming for them. However,                  
something has thrown off her plans a bit. Her daughter (whom she was pregnant           
with as she was getting married) is still alive. What affect this will have on          
her quest for vengeance is unclear, but the question is, will The Bride have          
actually succeeded in completing her ultimate goal, to kill Bill
