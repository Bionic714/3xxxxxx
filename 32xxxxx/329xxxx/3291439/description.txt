The final of the european championship of 1987 between the great team of USSR and one of the biggest surprises ever, Greece. Nikos Galis, is the protagonist scoring 40 points. One of the best players in the world (maybe the best along with Jordan)..You should check out his two pointer on the 25:38 of this video. One of the greatest in the history of game, like the whole game which is very dramatic and historic....QUality is not great but it's really worth it.
