,sebadooo,2005-06-07T00:18Z,"Hey, thanks. What bitrate are these files in? I personally can't stand anything below 128, but prefer at least 192. Just wonderin."
,blaze7,2006-01-12T06:52Z,"at an average of 52MB an album (471MB divided by 9) I'd guess at least 128 for the bitrate, maybe 192 for some. I'll post it when I get em down"

,ProjectMayhem,2006-04-12T03:35Z,Awesome post! Thanks so much! I love the Pixies so I'll seed this for a couple days.
,ProjectMayhem,2006-04-13T02:11Z,"I get ""Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file."" for many, but not all, of the songs. What gives? Funky codec or something?"
,tusen_lax,2006-05-11T13:33Z,"Would someone mind seeding?
I'm at 92%"
,JesusEatsBabies,2007-05-22T06:12Z,"thanks a ton, been looking for the purple tape for a while."
,JesusEatsBabies,2007-05-22T07:50Z,I'm having the same problem ProjectMayhem  is. Track 9(purple tape) says that but the other 8 work fine. I downloaded track 9 THREE TIMES and every time it wouldn't play.
,zid_f,2007-07-04T15:58Z,"Use WinAmp, then they all work"
,ElGreco27,2007-09-13T05:29Z,"Deleted once I saw the lack of track names, bitrates all over the place and general sloppiness of the package.  I couldn't tell what I was listening to half of the time.  Download a better torrent unless you MUST have this."
