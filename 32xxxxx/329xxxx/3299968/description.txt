This one hardly needs Mike and the bots, it's hilarious even without them. The movie jumps from cutscene to cutscene, without even a shred of a plot. It takes approximately one hour before something really happens.

The "plot" is about a Devil Fish that destroys everything in it's way, eating people etc. Think Jaws, but in a crazy european way.

Have fun :)
