 CKY2K is the original cast of Jackass, going far, far further than the MTV
     Show ever dared. In the freakfest that started it all, members of
     the Jackass cast lay waste to suburban America leaving a trail of
      carnage in their wake: wrecked automobiles, mullets, unlimited
amounts of excrement, explosions, fights, broken limbs, outrageous skate
      action, naked dave, fat suits, shopping carts duels, insane falls,
                     furniture surfing, bizzare skits and Bam´s dad.
IF YOU ARE EASILY OFFENDED SHUT THIS WINDOW DOWN AND RUN HOME TO MUMMY.
