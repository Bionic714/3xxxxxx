,Renaldo,2005-03-08T17:34Z,"Thanks for sharing!! I have this one already though. Now all seasons from 1-4 can be downloaded here at TPB, and the new season 6 can be downloaded episode by episode from http://www.tvtorrents.tv/. The only thing missing is season 5! It was shared on LokiTorrent before they went down, but now it's nowhere to be found! I don't suppose YOU have season 5 as well? It would be a great service if you could put it up in that case. It doesn't make the rounds on any torrent site whatsoever anymore."
,SConrad,2005-03-14T15:10Z,"Thanks for this one, just finished watching... No chance of someone having season 5 lying around?"
,rbkniklas,2005-03-15T02:33Z,season 5 is just up

My player turns of when i start any of this avi-files.
Someone else having this problem? Do i have to download again...:-"
,justletmeregister,2006-05-07T20:29Z,"BEWARE!!! These files have NO SOUND.

I don't know why people have written anything positive below. This was a HUGE waste of my bandwidth"
,justletmeregister,2006-05-07T20:38Z,"BEWARE! These files have NO SOUND!

I don't understand why people have written anything positive about this torrent. I've tried every available media player and always no sound. It downloaded very fast and I guess it's because there is no sound.

SAVE YOUR BANDWIDTH"
,rakslice,2006-07-24T06:39Z,"I don't know what justletmein is smoking... I grabbed the front of one of the files, and it had an AC3 audio stream, and the audio quality was fine.

General advice to newbs: 

If you're using Windows and you want to be able to play many of the random AVI files you find on the internet, you're going to need a codec pack that's pretty comprehensive.  Google is your friend.

And if you have problems playing a random file, use a tool like gspot to find out the codec fourcc and ids are, and look them up. Again, google is your friend. "

,tiffanyn1979,2006-07-24T11:47Z,Yeah he sent me a somewhat rude msg... I found it amusing and suggested he get a codec pack..... Ac3 is not exactly an obscure codec lol.
[V],pryll,2006-10-29T19:11Z,"where in the puzzle does ""elsie snuffin"" fit in? I canÂ´t find it anywhere, so what episode would you say it is? "
[V],pryll,2006-10-29T19:22Z,"ok, found it. the episode ""West Wing 4x06 Game On"" is in here two times, the first time it is called ""elsie snuffin""."
,scrltknt,2009-06-14T19:24Z,"hey guys.. I'm new to torrents so bear with me. When you click the link to download the torrent and open it using UTorrent (which is what i use), it asks you what files to download and where. Does it make a difference if you download the whole torrent at once or if you download individuals files, in terms of how fast it downloads?"
