,gabravo,2005-02-18T11:33Z,"Wow! thanks for these! , I have a couple of questions: is this boxset available for purchase somewhere? (a link would be much appreciated), and second: if i remember correctly episode #14 has never been available on dvd before, so how is the quality of this one? (I'm not saying that it's not a dvd-rip, my question is how is the quality of the picture in the dvd itself).
I hope i made myself clear, if not I'm sorry (english is not my native language)"
,cerberus67,2005-02-19T17:02Z,"Thanks, I was missing 5 episodes.

@ Killawife

In some BT clients you can specify which file to download.

I use Azureus. and in can set for each file the following:

Normal
High
Do not download

thats how i can download only the movies I'm missing"
,cerberus67,2005-02-19T17:11Z,"@Toba
Looks like a dvd-rip to me, if not it is one of the best VHS rips i've ever seen"
,gabravo,2005-02-19T17:30Z,"@Toba
Thanks for the reply man, and I will definetly give #14 a try, my copy looks like crap!"
,Lorentzo,2005-02-20T15:01Z,"Damn! You've just fixed my ""search-for-all-the-parts"" problem :D Hopefully this torrent will live for a while...gotta empty my harddrive so it fits ;)"
,darkkenji,2005-02-21T22:36Z,"doesn't do it for me. Get error message saying meta file is wrong when opening in azureus. I'm on a mac, which could be why.

Can annybody help?"
,darkkenji,2005-02-22T22:00Z,"yes, newest version. only ever had a similar problem if a file-name was too long or had a character difficult for mac.

any ideas?"
,darkkenji,2005-02-23T10:37Z,"same problem when renaming. Other clients give me errors too.

,Kalvadoss,2005-03-03T00:25Z,Ok I feel kinda dumb right about now because azueus says ive downloaded 18.58GB of 18.48GB so i guess this torrent has been heavily modified so I did a forced recheck and now im downloading again it says im at 88%. ive uploaded like 60GB not knowing I was missin a huge chunk of data me so stupid :P

I've been able to burn other things just fine after trying a couple of times, but these 'magic' episodes are killing me. Any help?"

,footsandwich,2008-09-09T23:06Z,"Downloaded torrent, but all the video files are listed as OGG?!?! that's audio only? WTF?"
,footsandwich,2008-09-09T23:22Z,nevermind. was trying to use media player with ogg codecs. just downloaded VLC and everything is fine.
,johnsmith1000,2008-10-25T10:34Z,"Anyone have trouble getting the subtitles to appear? It's not working for me, either in Quicktime, VLC or after buring to DVD. :("

,LezDawson,2009-02-05T18:22Z,"WARNING: Episodes 2, 3, 4 and 25 are not compatible with DivX players, and are not genuine avi files (although they will play on most soft media players).  I will be making each of these available in genuine avi form (XviD picture with mp3 audio).  Here is Episode 2:

,thesinisterurge,2009-03-01T17:36Z,"Anyone else have a problem with episodes #1 and #2?  When I try to convert them to DVD, it bombs out no matter what converter I try to use.  Other than that, this is AWESOME!

Thanks!"
,bob.tee,2010-01-01T21:58Z,This is a must seed to all Zatoichi Fans!!!
,bob.tee,2010-01-01T21:59Z,thank you for the great upload!!!
,joex15,2010-01-11T23:18Z,Thank You.
,Dekrypted,2010-01-25T16:38Z,i cant thank you enough!
,JonJustJon,2010-10-24T14:45Z,"Fantastic! Thank you so much for putting the effort into posting this, hard to find (at least in my loation), collection of brilliant movies. Also thanks to everyone that has continued to seed :)"
,Distort_Inc,2011-04-13T09:34Z,"Thank you so much for DLing these movies. Didn't think I would find them all. Using convertXtodvd3 it automatically adds the subs if they are in the same folder as the movie, and if you click on the sub in the burn menu, you can make the sub a default. Then you don't need to go to the subs menu unless you want to turn them off."
,MrCyberdude,2011-06-12T10:19Z,Thx +1
,flipflops,2012-01-15T01:35Z,This torrent is ancient but I hope it's still active. Impossible to find these for rent where I live and I'm pretty sure NF on line doesn't have it since they have very little of anything. thanks for the upload.
,flipflops,2012-01-15T16:24Z,"This is why I come to TPB, where else could I find all these. The torrent is loading very fast, I'm dl-ing one at a time and already have half the films. Thank you very much for this upload, Toba. I watched the first one and it was great, the translations very good. Much appreciated."
