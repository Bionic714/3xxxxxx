,Mrs.Lecter,2007-01-27T01:56Z,"pass is Van btw, for you who can't zip it whit www.mixermusic.net"
,nofearboy,2007-02-14T22:07Z,Why cant you upload a torrent without a password? Who do you think you are? 
,The Freestyler,2007-06-25T14:42Z,"So what's the password, you motherfucking son of a bitch? You should just get the fuck out of piratebay..."
,The Freestyler,2007-06-25T14:42Z,"Oh, yeah... And mixermusic doesn't work. Surprise, surprise."
,Dizzious,2007-09-21T00:59Z,"THE PASSWORD FOR THIS FILE IS :

Van

Typed exactly like that. 

Mrs.Lecter posted the pass back in fuckin january for those of you who were paying attention.... this Freestyler guy doesn't know how to read, apparently."
,sean_ttaylor,2010-02-28T03:40Z,"Dizzious, I do know how to read, if that once worked it no longer does. Van nor van works. Don't bother, don't support fags that like to password shit. If you don't mind FLAC files you can get this album off the discography at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4564143/Van_Halen_Discography_Part_2_(Sammy_Hagar_Era) by selecting the album you want."
