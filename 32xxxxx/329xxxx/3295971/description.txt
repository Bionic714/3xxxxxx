As requested i put up the great album by the kings of stoner rock, Kyuss.

This was ripped by me, mog, from a original cd and encoded directly into ogg vorbis.

Enjoy!

Note: I sit on ADSL (0.5Mbit) only so downloading won´t be that fast. I´m gonna try to seed as hard as i can. So no comments about seeding please.
