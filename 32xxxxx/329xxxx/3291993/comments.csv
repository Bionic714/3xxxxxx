oh, and you only need VLC player to play .MKV files.. why would i want to download more unnecessary video players and codecs?"
,mikha779,2007-10-15T10:31Z,"Well, if you liked it, there exists a manga somewhere that the director made as an ""extended ending""."
,shadowmoose,2009-05-28T10:00Z,"Good little short movie dealy thing.  Works on the current VLC, not sure why the uploader wants you to install some useless files you will only use once."

,pynipple,2011-10-21T07:04Z,"excellent video and audio quality - both english and japanese audio built-in and very good english subtitles

that makes this the only Voices Of A Distant Star video I'll ever need - this one has everything possible already in it

there were several seeders when I just DL'd it - thanks for that ... I'll keep seeding as well

THANKS for this torrent!"
,pynipple,2011-10-21T07:21Z,"for anyone asking how to listen to english vs japanese ... VLC player (free and easy to find/DL) 

once you start playing the movie, just click the ""audio"" tab at the top of the player and then in the ""audio track"" selection you will see both japanese and english as options ... you can change audio tracks any time and it doesn't restart or close the video

japanese is the default language encoded into this one, but the english audio is built-into the file and you DON'T need any other software besides the current version of VLC to use all this stuff

also, you can turn off the captions if you want by clicking the ""video"" tab and then ""subtitles"" and it's easy from there

this is such a beautiful story that it's worth watching in the original japanese after you've seen it a time or two in english

the music and atmosphere are simply amazing and it will have you thinking about it long after you've finished watching it

thanks again to all seeders out there!"
