   Description:


   Based on a true story... Set during the famous airdrop before
   the invasion at Normandy, where Sgt. Matt Baker and his squad
   of 101st Airborne Paratroopers are scattered over the French 
   countryside.

   As the story unfolds, you must choose between the success of
   your mission and the lives of your men - your brothers in arms.

   Brothers In Arms will immerse players in the historic eight-day 
   invasion of Normandy - with unparalleled imagery, authenticity,
   sound, and gameplay.

   Note: A kick ass game? :p
