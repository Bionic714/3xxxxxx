Might be more convenient for some if the post separated out the different albums rather than one rar."
,Camelmiester,2005-03-06T20:41Z,"A great post - My vinyl of these is worn out anyway! I wonder if I could take all that vinyl back to the label and demand digital copies....
BTW speakeasy - Try out Azureus as a download client, it lets you do selective downloads from collections such as these.
