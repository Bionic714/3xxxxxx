,oestrogen,2005-06-17T23:09Z,"Undertexterna till den här filmen har, om mina misstankar stämmer, tagits från Disney's release (därav alla extra repliker (så att amerikanska barn förstår vad som händer)) och är egentligen skrivna för hörselskadade (därav alla utskrivna ljudeffekter)."
,thenickdude,2006-02-19T09:41Z,"Subs are ""English for the hearing impaired"", and I think that they were written from the English dub dialogue, blecch! Not recommended."
,Kanqin,2008-02-03T21:55Z,"Really bad subs. They seems to be taken directly from the english manustricpt. Even if you dont speak japanese this will disturb you, and if you do it isnt even watchable.
If you feel you dont care, enjoy this torrent. Pic quality etc is fine."
,Falco98,2009-02-04T00:16Z,"came here to comment on the subs also.  video is good; english subs appear to be subtitles for the english sub version.  if you want to see a good example of why dubs suck, watch this version to notice all the places extra english dialogue was added merely as a filler for the ""silence"" (not necessarily a good thing).  the subs are hard-coded in the video, so it's not as if they can be patched over with a corrected version.  too bad, i'm having a hard time finding another good subbed version in divx-size."
,Falco98,2009-02-04T00:17Z,"sorry, my first sentence should have read ""english subs appear to be subtitles for the english *DUB* version.""
my bad."
