,janma,2005-02-27T17:56Z,has any1 tried it yet?
,pudeldroska,2005-02-27T21:56Z,"I have tried it and my only advice is: if you don't have the hardware specified by MS, don't bother trying.
There are better alternatives that has much better hardware support (like Media Portal, it works on windows and it's open source)."
,Xm128,2005-03-07T20:24Z,Seedes please!!!
,BBBB,2005-03-10T15:09Z,När jag startar datorn får jag ett felmeddelande att den inte kan ladda dos - har testat både med direkt bräning av denna version och bricks och dessutom ändrat med guiden/isobuster som länkas till i bricks. Felmeddelandet blir anorlunda beroende på om jag använt isobuster eller inte men kommer lika tidigt (strax efter att den börjat läsa cd:n. Är båda versonerna defekta eller gör jag fel?
,Nicke881,2005-03-13T11:31Z,e det på svenska?
,aac_ripper,2005-03-16T10:24Z,Högt betyg på ett tydligen struligt paket.

,jharvie,2005-04-12T11:40Z,"Do you have to format the computer or just upgrade because I have windows xp pro sp1 and I upgraded to windows xp media center 2005 using the brick version and it just upgraded my computer to  windows xp pro sp2.


swedish version:

Måste du att formatera datoren, eller den rättvisa förbättringen, därför att jag har fönsterxp pro sp1 och jag förbättrade till fönster, xp sommassmedia centrerar 2005 genom att använda tegelstenversionen, och den förbättrade precis den min datoren till fönsterxp pro sp2."
,sprung,2005-04-15T12:54Z,"can anyone pls tell me how to install this thing. the instructions did not elaborate cleary enough on what exactly to do.i unrar all the files then used daemon tools to mount the 1st cd, then burned to a cd. as for the 2nd cd which contains media ctr, tablet pc and netfx, what should i do with it and how do i install it?? thx"
,jharvie,2005-05-11T11:26Z,"the MSDN Version is crap.

I re formatted my computer then when i was installing it said that a whole bunch of files were missing.

I went to put the 2nd cd in and it did nothing."
,LaFemme69,2005-06-07T05:49Z,"Hi.  Just to let you guys know, I'ved tried to install WMC 2005 on my regular ibm clone and it installed fine.  Working well.  Not quite sure what specific hardwares needed for the WMC 2005 to work but I got standard components to watch TV, DVD, listen to music....blah blah.... ATI a-i-w 64MB, SB Audigy 2 ZS, Sony SDM-HS95P DVI input, 5.1 surround....

However, the WMC 2005 that I installed with is from a DVD (11 in 1) but I am looking for it in a standalone CD (since not all pc has a dvd-rom).  My questions are:

(1) the MSDN comes in 2-3 cds, how do I install it?
(2) the 1st cd only said 'Windows XP' and not 'Windows Xp Media Center Edition 2005'?

Please help!!!

,xopetz,2006-01-14T17:36Z,"hi guys. i just tried to install it. it works fine for me. maybe your problem is the winrar and the burner software. im using winrar gold edition --> http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3430762  to extract it and nero 7 for burn it into CD. dont burn in with max speed, it may make the file corrupt. give it a try if you have any problem contact me on xopetz@hotmail.com ... thanks to KnockiMov -- well done !!!!"

vanTorX"
,vanTorX,2006-05-11T07:43Z,"ok, it works just fine as advertised, check if you have crappy CDROM from which you are installing, I had missing files during install but replacement of CDROM cured it and installed just fine, was asked to insert CD2 during install, then CD1 again, after did the crack and all is just fine, the program MediaCenter which is what this is all about is inside programs, accessories

thx to seeders and orig packager

,pppkk2,2008-06-14T02:56Z,how to write these cds can anybody tell me?
,alex_the_only,2008-08-22T19:08Z,"OK LISTEN EVERYONE!!! The only reason why you see Windows Media Center Edition ver. 2002 srvice pack 2 in the my computer properties is because, Windows Xp Pro. is MCE!!! MCE is based on Xp Pro. So My computer is trying to say windows Xp Pro. Version 2002 NOT MCE 2002. This Version is 2005 beacaue when you follow this route in the registry,HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Media Center you will see the num. 3.0 for the key called, Ident.  If it says, 2.7 then its MCE 2002. if its 2.8, its MCE 2004. if its 3.0, its MCE 2005. if its 3.1 or 4.0, then its MCE 2005 with rollup 1 or 2 or both. if its 5.0, its Vista Media Center. So now You Know This Is Media Center 2005. Thanks Man For The Great Upload"
