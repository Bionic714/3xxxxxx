OK here's a great Screeching Weasel show with excellent sound, it's in a tiny club and they are on excellent form. This is a must have show for anyone... but especially fans as this is a great example of what they must have been like live, enjoy!

Screeching Weasel-JC Dobbs Philadelphia 20th March 1993 SVCD 43 Minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
