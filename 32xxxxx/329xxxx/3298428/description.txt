BOX HYPE:
  ~~~~~~~~~
  Nearly three years after taking the underground gaming scene by storm with
  Uplink, Introversion Software is poised to release its follow-up title,
  Darwinia. Combining fast paced action with strategic battle planning, the
  game features a novel and intuitive control mechanism, a graphical style
  ripped from 80's retro classics, and a story concerning a tribe of video
  game sprites trapped in a modern 3d game world.
