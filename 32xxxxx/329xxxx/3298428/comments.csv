It actually looks quite cool."
,c-fan,2005-03-05T22:32Z,"special indeed, and pretty damn fun! :D
they did an awesome job on this, originality like this is seldom in todays gaming scene.."
,SNS_PeTTs0n,2005-03-05T23:09Z,"this is a really neat game, prob. best for nerds though ;)"
,helghast,2005-03-06T02:24Z,"this was a huge letdown for me. I've seen the screens and heard about this a couple of months ago and now that it's here it's basicly just black&white minus the minion. Apart from the graphics it doesent really have anything original.
Props to the uploader though."
,Vision9,2005-03-11T00:08Z,"wtf? do you know how hard this develpoer hav had to get this game a publisher in the first place??? do them a favor and support small undependent game developers by buying the game instead.... i mean plz, there is a limit to what you can download whith a good conscience... "
[V],Submachine,2005-05-05T20:52Z,"""i mean plz, there is a limit to what you can download whith a good conscience... ""

Not really."
,elmako,2005-05-14T14:30Z,"you HAVE to download this one and at least try it out. As said in the info, VERY special game...kind of a mix between Red Alert and Lemmings :) The graphics is totally awesome and the game is very easy to learn."
,hello51,2005-05-29T19:03Z,"The .cue file doesn't work when i try to mount it with Daemon tools, windows gives me an error."
,Shadowvortekkx,2005-08-01T01:58Z,How the heck do you save game?
,Soulfly_lp,2005-08-10T18:10Z,Is this a demo version????
,Zaghrog,2006-01-09T19:53Z,I cant get this thing to work! Windows gives me an error when I try to open the .cue file. plz someone tell me what to do!
,LoneWolF,2006-01-25T16:08Z,"I love this game! Im gonne buy it for sure, but i had to try it first ;) ."
,TheWierd86,2006-02-05T22:25Z,Nice m8! this game ROCKS!!!!!
,TheWierd86,2006-02-05T22:27Z,"haha, Zaghrog. the "".cue"" file just refer to the "".bin"" file. dont need to use it actually."
,magupotato,2006-03-19T15:45Z,"i cant install it... can play directly from the image, but cant install it... when i open the setup, this thing does nothing... if anyone knows the solution, tell me..."
,Taiko88,2006-04-01T05:03Z,"You guys are dumasses, go to the drop down menu before mounting and click view all files, then click on the bin file not the cue, or you will get an error, freaking noobs..."
,Ihabtheactionhero,2006-06-18T15:02Z,"Damn this game rock! Played both demos(One on steam and one on the website) on my Linux computer(Only Full Version works on windows) This game should get a award... 


:-)"
,Optional,2006-07-07T23:09Z,"Submachine, i know you are probably not much of a gamer (or else you would APPRECIATE THIS GAME AND NOT LET PEOPLE JUST PLAY IT WITHOUT EARNING THE RIGHT TO) but for all the real connoisers of this art form out there, TRY NOT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEATHS OF DEVELOPERS SO INVENTIVE THAT THE REST OF THE MARKET CAN'T KEEP UP. In other words, don't be a bastard and let this game die."
,-=Creaper=-,2006-07-09T14:35Z,Darwinia crashes when i click on the garden!
,Kevin_o0,2006-07-16T16:41Z,"optional owns a good point.. by buying the game you can let the developers develop and flourish.

But these torrents may server as a preview of the game, i dont like demos at all. I always download torrents before i buy games. You know my salary gives me no problems. :)

so here is my True Problem ... When i press the world Garden in the map the game gets crushed..ANy Suggestions??

to give you a possible hint i currently am on 1998 Graphic Card with 1 FPS.. i think it will be two weeks from today since i'll buy a new one.."
,Mariandl,2006-09-09T13:47Z,BUY THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE IT - support introversion soft.
,dremoran,2007-06-30T18:08Z,"Ok, i've downloaded the files, what next? 
And dont answer ""Mount with Daemon tools, becuse im going to burn it down on cd later. 
Please someone answer! I can bearly wait untill i can play this game!"
,DuSkaHetaFisk,2007-07-12T12:29Z,Is this a demo or the real game??
,s1ay,2007-12-23T02:37Z,Damn steam dosnt give me linux vertion.  Great game!  Screw steam.  I'm not runing something that could be run native in wine.
,fiftyone.area,2008-01-15T10:32Z,I'm somewhat of a nerd and I think this game bytes!
,VEpP,2008-01-29T01:28Z,"yeah... s1ay, im ashamed you ever associated yourself with steam.... its a horrible product."
,VEpP,2008-01-29T02:47Z,"oh hey. i believe that the problem for all these pcs crashing on garden is the graphics are too high for your comp. i know that sounds insane, but i can most everything after 2006 on medium to high settings. with this darwinia, i have to run it all low(and its not supposed to be a very demanding game). with 800x600 and i am still experiencing lag. so, change your options before you enter the garden, set it all to low if you havent already and see if that helps."
,HenrikOlsen,2008-02-25T20:00Z,"This is a very old version, it reports itself as 1.0.

When the first patch came the version became 1.2, so the crashes may be because this one is actually a prerelease."
,xajkor513,2008-06-29T14:00Z,"You don't need to install the game.. just copy the ""gamefiles"" folder from the cd... and then you run it from ""Darwinia.exe"" you can save and everything, no problems. "
,pdm666,2008-09-27T11:34Z,"jesus christ, try the .bin file, you n00bs.

why are you guys even touching a pc? buy an xbox and stfu"
,bshs_matt08,2008-10-24T17:31Z,"...ok, everyone STFU! people are going to buy...   ...good for them, people are going to pirate...   ...good for them, people are going to share pirated goods...   ...good for them...   ...WHO GIVES A DAMN! isn't the comment area supposed to be for noobs who need help, and information about the torrent? and Wroleader, nobody gives a care about how your pc can run this thing on high, some people dont have the money to upgrade their pc's, let alone upgrade internet speed...   ...DOES ANYONE ELSE SEE THIS!?!?!?!?"
,0-LSD-0,2009-04-14T11:14Z,"Wroleader are you fucking retarded? Oh, so you have the cash for a ""better computer"" but you aren't going to buy the game?
I have an Average computer and it runs it fine.

If you want to gloat about how good your pc is, go do it on the Crysis page."
