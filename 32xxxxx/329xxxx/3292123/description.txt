  ------------------------------ Release Notes -------------------------------
  The source disc  appears to have  been put  together from a two DVD box set.
  The extra's are  found under the  Storyboard  main menu item and some of the
  extra's are  found under  the wrong  menu item.  (The "Interview  with Roger
  Ebert" and "Interview with Isao Takahata" are switched.) Also, when you wait
  too long to choose an item from the extra's menu, it will switch to the next
  extra's menu.  Since we discovered this after creating the image, we decided
  to leave it this way.

  But that's what happens when you buy Hong Kong DVDs. Serves you right for
  being a cheap-ass, I guess :)
