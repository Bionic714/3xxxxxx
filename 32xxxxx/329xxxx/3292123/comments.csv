Suffer the Little Children Is it possible to grieve after watching animation? If you don't after watching Grave of the Fireflies, you may be required to turn in proof that you still have a human heart....

,zenzen,2005-02-19T21:48Z,"reichert.. this was one of the first animes i ever saw. cried my ass of. read the book also. and read some articles about the real story that this movie and the book is based upon. 

anyways.. amazing flick. you people should add more anime dvdrs.. they are so hard to come by nowadays. "
,aM1bEK,2005-02-19T23:34Z,"Completely agree with the previous comments. This film hooked me up on Studio Ghibli :) Never thought animated film can move me that much. 
Too bad this release is probably is not of the best quality :( I wish somebody would release official R2 Japanese DVD:

According to the comparisions here:

it has the best video quality."
,jimrazor,2005-02-20T15:04Z,big thx. more anime dvdrs would be great ( :
,zenzen,2005-03-04T12:34Z,"the animators animated both films at the same time. they have said that they had lots of trouble keeping both movies apart. but as you say, totoro makes you feel good while hotaru doesnt at all. like it was intended i guess."
,cainz,2005-03-06T23:52Z,"Tack! Äntligen hittade jag en DVDr-version av filmen, den är helt underbar. :)"
,atos,2005-03-12T07:55Z,"One of the classic Ghibli movies.

I would also recomend Mimi wo Sumaseba (Whisper of the Heart) and Omohide Poro Poro (Only Yesterday). Not quite as touching but still good. Perhaps made for a more mature audience.."
,CrazyRabbit,2007-07-20T20:12Z,Nice up! Thanx! Is it possible to upload .mdf (or any other checksum file)? Thanx again!
,Yattering,2007-12-23T09:36Z,Thanks
,hannibal2323,2008-06-12T05:06Z,"Thanks zenzen, great torrent. 

I made the mistake of not reading the description as carefully as I should have, and didn't realise how different this film is to the other Studio Ghibli stuff! Definitely a very tragic film, but an absolute classic nonetheless."
,Epitaph44,2008-10-28T01:31Z,Some seeders would be amazing.
,aimen14,2012-01-23T08:24Z,seeeeeeeeed
