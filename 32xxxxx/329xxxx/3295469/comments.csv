,BrownPants,2011-02-02T08:54Z,"I finally got an account so I can post the following; COULD SOMEBODY FUCKING SEED THIS, PLEASE? I know for a fact that about 5 other guys and I have been waiting, at least, a month for somebody to show up with this. No one has done it yet, you motherfuckers are greedy. Every time I download something from here I stay online for a min. of a week. Also, guys up there that commented and, probably, have this; get your asses to seed!!! Kind of a long rant but somebody had to say it. 
Fuckers! 

Ps. Thanks to malco :D ! "
