Great quality!

I got this video years ago from a friend in San Francisco. The original is in Betamax format , and I have now converted it to a nice SVCD format. It's in two .mpg files, and you can either burn it to a CD-R or just watch on your computer. As far as I know it was never released commercially. This is primo golden age Flipper!

The show alternates between Flipper playing live in a TV studio, and then being interviewed. If you're into Flipper, this is great stuff. They do a lot of their classics like Sex Bomb, Way of the World
