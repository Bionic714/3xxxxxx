,jonasmannen,2005-02-24T09:53Z,"Yup.
Do NOT bother with Norton Ghost. 
Everything Norton does sucks ass, except marketing, they're really good at that.

With ghost 9.0 you have to boot from your recovery disk if you wish to restore your c-drive, which takes forever. Ghost 2003 is better, but this is even better. Small, fast, generates smaller images, AND you do't have to install that f*ing .NET framework.

USE THIS INSTEAD!
Samtidigt, nån annanstans, satt familjen Bush och diskuterade vilket land de skulle bomba nu."
,JonesSmith,2005-02-27T01:57Z,"Ideend, this IS GOOD software!
I just tried to get things done with Ghost 2005 and Ghost 2003 and they are nothing compared to this!"
,diakto,2005-04-04T16:13Z,"Verkar jävligt bra, får väl dra hem den kan inte låta bli...
Gillar att den bränner IMAGEN på DVDn direkt

,manson666,2005-04-14T09:54Z,"Vad menas med detta var inne på Acronis hemsida och fick för mig att man bara kan göra en backup på hela sin hårddisk med alla program genom att spara sin backup hos Acronis och sedan hämta den därifrån ""ONLINE"" ""Acronis True Image allows you to create an online system disk backup without restarting your system"" min fråga till de lärde lyder, har någon testat hur det funkar om det är så här eller om man kan göra en egen bootable dvd image av C: utan att krångla med online grejer!

Take care!"
,hornetsuk,2005-04-21T14:53Z,What the fuck? dont spam your shit in others people releases. This works in both dos and windows. You dont even need the damn thing installed once you have made the boot cd because you can boot from it and create and restore images outside windows if you want. 
,yourdaddy,2005-04-22T13:09Z,Sorry for that hornetsuk. It wasn't my intension to piss you off. I just wanted to make people aware of this great prog. (even you). Why don't you try it and see for yourself. Sorry and have a nice day everyone. :wave:
,hornetsuk,2005-04-23T02:52Z,"I shouldnt have lost it, you caught me on a bad day. Sorry about that."
,cribba76,2005-04-25T23:48Z,"when i install this program i was forced to restart computer in safe mode and when i uninstalled the program ""it didnt recognize the hard drive and it does not support dynamic disk"". I tried it on windows 2000 "
,KOREA Nuclear,2005-06-12T07:21Z,"I really like this prog. I have got both the acronis true image and ghost v9 from norton, but this is the one i got to know (acronis).

In the while, I want to congratulate both yourdaddy and hornetsuk for having settled down the misunderstanding in such an educated way. Its good to us all to shape a mature internet (and free...i hope).  Greetings from Argentina! ------- Arg 3 - Brazil 1 (worldcup classification match result)  :D"
,kipzoon,2006-04-26T01:44Z,Using all version 9 I run only in problems. This one works fine even faster.
,kipzoon,2006-05-15T23:34Z,"After a few weeks I reconsidder my above note. Even this one is corrupted like all other versions on this site. All makes your system not stable.I wander if they are coming from acronis, they do'nt seems to like P2P."
