MP3 Audio book - introduced by Howard Zinn  and read by Mat Damon.  Tells you the People history [not the official propaganda] of the United states 

Intereesting information  ... toatlly different from what you see on TV  and  read in college courses on Democracy [sic.] 

Unless you have an idea of what men like Howard Zinn have said and what prophets like Jeronimo were actually and really like ... then  you will always have a distorted version of history that is just official [mason] materialist propaganda in the service of the pyramid.

Side note : Too bad the Soviets were too corrupt and dumb to grasp neither the value of telling truth nor the value of "good" propaganda!
