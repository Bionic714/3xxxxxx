,VJoe10Waffle,2012-08-21T21:26Z,"Again, decent upload, video quality is between 360p - 480p
Video: 7/10
Audio: 8/10
The audio quality is a bit iffy at times, sometimes it's normal, sometimes it's way quieter but it's all there. I do really like how the uploader puts little notes in the videos that say interesting things of that episode."
