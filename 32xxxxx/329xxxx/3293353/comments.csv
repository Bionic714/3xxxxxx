When I click on Download this Torrent, in Ubuntu it says Invalid byte sequence in
conversion input error 
 I'm not sure what the problem is.  I sure would like
this music file though."

I appreciate this torrent, but for the love of God and music PLEASE reseed this torrent! If only for 10 minutes!!!"
,xtyrantx,2009-04-09T22:13Z,"Such a fantastic upload!  But it is still stuck at 98.8% for everyone.  It's April 9, 2009.   Can anyone fully downloaded seed for just a few moments so a couple others can get the .2 percent and we can get going, this collection is fantastic!"
