,mika6699,2005-02-28T03:11Z,"You got my vote. Just hoping there are no awfully ""customized"" sound themes in this one like the trogdor versions. (yeah, yeah, I know they can be disabled/overwritten) :)"
,CrazyGlista,2005-02-28T08:52Z,It is only one theme added.The sounds are original and are not changed. All users who want to have English keyboard layout should uncheck the option for Slovenian keyboard.I added this option for my Slovenian friends.Everything(programs and windows) are in English and already registered or activated.
,Miqer,2005-02-28T12:42Z,"And can you run xp updates? Or do I need a windows key changer thing for that?

thanks,

Miq"
,CrazyGlista,2005-02-28T17:45Z,"The windows are Corporate version and you can instal them on 1000 computers if you want. They are already activated and you do not need any key or anything, and the updates are working 100 %. All programs on this cd are activated or registered so you will never be asked for any key in the future."
,CrazyGlista,2005-02-28T22:05Z,"If you get the 101 eror you just navigate to program files folder and find the Microsoft antispyware folder, open it and double click on gcasServ.exe Then it will work just fine. it is Microsoft's bug not mine :-(("
,CrazyGlista,2005-03-01T15:26Z,"Ok I managed to fix that error in Microsoft antispyware, but will be fixed in next release. [b]ONCE AGAIN[/b] if you check the antispyware to install and then when you doubleclick the antispyware icon on desktop you will get the 101 Error. [b]There is nothing wrong with the program.[/b]Just navigate to c: Program Files=>Microsoft Antispyware folder and doubleclick on the file ""[b]gcasDtServ.exe[/b]"" When you do this the program will start to work with no problems.Everything else on this cd works like a charm !!!!! :mrgreen: "

,adrianxx,2005-03-02T15:15Z,"I tried to burn the image with Nero but durin installation it got stuck. So I tried to burn the image with Alcohol 120% but it still got stuck. Has anyone used this as an intallation disk? Anyone know if something is wrong?

Thanks in advance

,CrazyGlista,2005-03-02T17:57Z,"1. Unpack the first RAR and you will get the .iso file

2. Start nero Express choose ""Disk image or saved project""

3. Navigate to .iso file

4. Burn the CD (the burning speed is not important) 

Ok, the cd is bootable.The bios must be set that the first boot device is CD-rom.

Start the computer, when asked to ""press any key...."" : PRESS ANY KEY to start the instalation from CD.

Follow the instructions about making partitions... 

The copying files process is taking a little bit longer because of the high compression of files.The computer does not stuck!! Just wait till the end of process.

When all your files are copied on your disk (blue screen with yellow progress line) the computer will reboot.

 DO NOT PRESS ANY BUTTON when you get the ""press any button...."" mesage ! 

The installation will begin...

From here on everything is simple.

If you want English keyboard layout please UNCHECK the option for Slovenian Keyboard in the install menu. 

The applications menu has a 3 minute countdown. After that the default programs will be installed.

I hope it will help...

,CrazyGlista,2005-03-02T19:33Z,"jobspy 123 about your problem and for all or non slovenian users about  keyboard and regional setings: Go to Start=>Settings=>Control Panel=>Regional and Language Options=>under tab Regional options select the country you live in (Germany, UK, Italy....) than under tab Languages click on the button ""Details"" and set everything to your language (delete the Slovenian keyboard) then close that window and now press the ""Advanced"" tab on the main window and set the language that you want . At the end click Apply, and you will be promped to restart he computer. Reboot and you wil have the language you want. "
,CrazyGlista,2005-03-02T19:39Z,Next release will be COMPLETE English with few resolution presets and maybe firewall or something . I am limited to one  CD so I must be careful choosing the programs. 
,adrianxx,2005-03-02T21:25Z,"Hi CrazyG,

Thanks for your answer. I did all you said but then it says coppying office 2003 then the computer says that it must  restart. It restarts fine but then gets stuck on the window logo page.

I never saw a question asking if I  want English keyboard layout. Any ideas?


CrazyG, thanks allot for your very kind help.

Best Regards,

Adrian

,Miqer,2005-03-02T23:51Z,"Hay,

I have a question... I installed it from a CD, not to the C drive (G:), so i have two xp versions to choose from... now this works fine with your CD, but I don't gek to choose Office or the other gadgets anywhere?! Do I install them myself from the CD? 

Thanx,
M."
,dizk,2005-03-03T03:41Z,"Great release! however, i get an error when im trying to run the ms antispyware thingy.. 

""Warning. , Microsoft AntiSpyware has encourted a critical error (error 101). Please restart Microsoft AntiSpyware again...blablabla""

Whats this?"
,dizk,2005-03-03T16:26Z,"oops, works like a dream now =)"
,snoozy2002,2005-03-05T17:52Z,"Why don't people make their own ""Unattended"" Windows Xp installation.
Who knows what other software this installation has that is not mentioned.

If you want to create your own XP Cd check this site:
http://unattended.msfn.org/"
,CrazyGlista,2005-03-05T22:04Z,"@snoozy 2002 
Maby some people do not have knowledege or time to make their own unattended windows, so this is the way for them to get their own copy. So if you don't like it just skip it and post your stupid posts about what kind of ""suspicious"" files will be installed with this copy somewhere else.

And yes the page http://www.msfn.org/ is the best pace to learn how to make your own copy. 
So people visit this page and start to make your own copy from zero, because of the posts like snoozy's i will stop seeding  right about NOW!"
,gogolgoth,2005-04-02T23:23Z,"Thanks to CrazyG for this excellent release. Windows XP + SP2 + essential apps in a single no-bullshit package is extremely neat and usefull - this is worthy of six+ stars. Recommended for anyone owning a PC!

Also highly recommended for Windows XP owners ;-)"
,Vegaz,2005-04-06T23:08Z,"When I opened the folder I found a series of files numbered from 1 to 41. This is probably a dumb question, but what am I supposed to do with these?"
,XJC,2005-04-13T10:49Z,"Great idea .. I would add SATA drivers to the CD though , so people with SATA disks can install windows without having to do a special install.

Silicon Image 3112 and 3114 drivers would be a good first addition."
,dxjnorto,2005-05-03T09:12Z,Vegaz.  Install WinRAR.  Navigate to the folder with the 41 files.  Select all.  Extract to your desktop or somewhere you can find the finished ISO file.  Then follow CrazyGs directions to use Nero Express to create a bootable disk.
,hitodozo,2005-06-08T04:58Z,can it be updated?
,[FIN]aciid,2005-06-21T17:50Z,"does this suport update and does it include spyware??
i hope it works fine bechause im going to test this on my coputer."
,data_man,2005-06-23T22:33Z,"can I disasemble it and take of some of its programs myself by the Nlight program or something else?

Thank you for your great job!"
,[FIN]aciid,2005-06-25T16:09Z,Thanks CrazyGlista this works just fine avesome Mod...
,zyro70,2005-07-04T17:22Z,when are you coming out with the new version to fix the keyboard and language issue. because it leaves the menu when you right click a drive in slovakian.
