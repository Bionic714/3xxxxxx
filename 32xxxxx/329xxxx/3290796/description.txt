I bought this disc a couple years ago.  If you want to burn to DVD-5, go ahead and transcode or re-encode to burn whatever version of the disc you want.  Personally I would make 2 discs:

1) only the film on it - no menus.  English 5.1 and keep the subs.
2) full disc - same as original but more compressed.

They double-dipped me on this one, so I think the old version of the movie (that I bought and post here) is fair game :)

Enjoy!
