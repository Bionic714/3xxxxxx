What else do you need! This is Picotto, an absolute blinding compilation from those people at BXR! got the classics like 'LIZARD' COMIN TO GET CHA! and IGUANA, plus the blinding good tracks komodo and excellent judge jules caned tune 'like this like that' nicely mixed together, very nice package overall... anyone who knows picotto & knows BXR should definetely invest in this monster!
