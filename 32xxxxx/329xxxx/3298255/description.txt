This is the Pies best album for me anyway it such an overlooked classic and guaranteed to get you rockin after the liquidation of Immediate their first record company (Albums AS SAFE AS YESTERDAY IS and TOWN AND COUNTRY what are seeded on this site as the IMMEDIATE ANTHOLOGY with extra tracks) It shows a sort of back to basics approach it has its rockers (ONE EYED TROUSER SNAKE RUMBA, IM READY and RED HOT MAMMA, RED HOT!) it has its ballads (EARTH AND WATER SONG and SUCKING THE SWEET VINE) its comedy (ONLY A ROACH and THEME FROM SKINT(SEE YOU LATER LIQUIDATOR) and its epic.(LIVE WITH ME) all tracks are in .wma and like all the Humble pie albums i will seed i will realese them as wma files first then flac later.
