Murnau's "Nosferatu" was the very first film about the Dracula character; it is still one of the best.

Unfortunately the (lack of) image quality on this release is horrible. Don't blame me though, I'm giving you exactly what's on the disc. If you're particular about technical quality, please leave now.

PAL, DD2.0, 71 min, 4:3, full disc (no extras), English subtitles.
