,timtin,2005-03-06T20:23Z,"This is an old movie from 1922, not any musical, moron... :)"
,ghu052,2005-03-07T04:14Z,Silent movies usually have a soundtrack! ;-)
,MoB,2005-03-07T08:59Z,"I would also like to know which version this is... There's a few versions out there...  one with type'o'negative's rock score, one with some library music and one with original music."
,MoB,2005-03-07T09:03Z,"And yes, silent movies have soundtrack! There used to be a guy playing piano(?) when movie was played.. there are notesheets for this one and they restored the original score..."

,Philosogogue,2007-01-12T05:44Z,"Great Film.

Regarded generally as the best, and certainly the most well known, remake of ""Nosferatu"" reigns Verner Herzog's 1979 masterwork ""Nosferatu the Vampyre,"" starring Klaus Kinski.

Another soundtrack indeed exists to the original Murnau classic. "
,The_Enigmatic_ronin,2007-03-21T22:30Z,Does it have any subs????????????
,The_Enigmatic_ronin,2007-03-21T22:31Z,"Sorry, I just saw it"
,Phuda,2008-09-23T12:35Z,"hello to all. I see that here are some doubts about this torrent. I have downloaded few nosferatu torrents and i can say that this is the BEST one !
All the torrent containing stooped Yellow-Black movies :(, but this one is white-black. I watched this movie only because of this torrent ! so believe me on my word this torrent is great. Almost to forgot this dvd movie don't have first 10 minutes of beginning this movie, i figured it out what i watched other movies that i downloaded. Thanks for this upload Beat !
Regards to all ! if i find out something good i will write here... if someone is interested... "
,rahat-lukum,2009-09-01T02:26Z,"Yeah, I hate those blue-yellow tinted versions too. That ""restoration by the F.W. Murnau Foundation"" just fucking killed the authentic feel of this great movie. So, despite of the serious footage loss (71 min instead of 94 min) this is the great release."
,Tuttankhamun,2010-09-06T16:34Z,"I agree with Phuda and rahat-lukum. This is the original version before restoration by the F.W. Murnau Foundation. Awesome torrent ! 
I had downloaded this other torrent before and this is the one that satisfies me so far. The other one before is a bit pixelated and it's a Kino edition too. I hate that blue-yellow tinted version. This is the untouched version. Thank you so much, Beat !"
