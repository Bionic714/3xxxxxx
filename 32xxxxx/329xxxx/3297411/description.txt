Normally Bands have their eponymous debut, the difficult album second and the breakthrough album third. The ever iconoclastic Supergrass released their breakthrough album first, sold over 300,000 copies of their second and have chosen to deliver their eponymous release at the peak of their career. A strange way to do things perhaps but then Supergrass have never been content to take the conventional route to music stardom. Their first live shows for instance were played to a herd of cows next to bassist Mickey Quinn's house! 

So what of this much anticipated third album? Recorded at the Sawmill Studio in Cornwall (the band's preffered recording venue since even before they were signed) it is very much the product of a band growing up and realising the potential that so many spotted at an early age. As usual the sound is a fusion of a bewildering collection of influences ranging from the Buzzcocks to the Beatles, Bowie and the Rolling Stones to name just a few. The magic of Supergrass is in the way that they tie these influences together to create a sound that is totally their own, deftly, almost hypnotically, twisting and turning from one musical style to another with seamless perfection. 

Highlights on the album include Pumping On Your Stereo, released as a single earlier this year, the strange Jesus Came From Outer Space (camping it up something chronic - Ziggy-era Bowie would've been proud!) and Mama & Papa, the album's closing track with Quinn taking over on vocals. Stunning!
