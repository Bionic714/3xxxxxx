      Star Wars Republic Commando is a squad-based first person shooter 
      that lets you explore the elite world of the Star Wars military. 
      Leading a 3-man squad of Republic Commandos, your missions take you 
      deep behind enemy lines on over 14 intense and challenging levels 
      through three different campaigns where you will face more than ten 
      brutal enemies. 
  
      You'll have more than a dozen deadly weapons at your disposal, but 
      none    more lethal than your squad. What makes the squad in Star 
      Wars Republic Commando so unique is the game's innovative 
      One Touch Squad Control system that allows you to engage your squad 
      with just one button.

      A few notes from our cracker about this PROPER
  
      Firstly let me say welcome to PCGAME to the scene. Nice game for a 
      first release :). There is however some problems with your securom 
      removal as I will list here. In the game code there is a whole 
      heap of securom calls that have not been fixed to their correct 
      API pointer.
