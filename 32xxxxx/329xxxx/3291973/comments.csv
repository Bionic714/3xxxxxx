,Muffinhead,2008-08-22T17:20Z,"I'm stuck at 95.6% as well, Please seed! Why bother freakin' uploading anything if you aren't going to seed it all of the way?"
,Muffinhead,2008-08-22T21:35Z,"Someone seed this damn thing already, stop being a bunch of fucking leechers and contribute by keeping this seeded.

Jesus fucking almighty Christ, maybe TPB should remove torrents nobody is seeding, perhaps that might keep people seeding to keep them alive.

I'm referring to you who added the torrent as well as the bunch of losers who just leeched without seeding."

,samuelprados,2009-10-09T12:56Z,"in this very moment there are 25 potential seeders, needing only 4.4% more to become seeders, and the torrent will be alive again... this is a scene release, so i doubt no one has this one anymore... but where are they???"
