When Aceveda moves on to his new City Council position, Captain Monica Rawling takes over the Barn and empowers Vic to implement her controversial anti-gang policies. Things also get complicated when Antwon Mitchell moves back into town. Antwon is a former gang drug distributor who is back in Farmington in his new role as community leader. He is preaching a positive message to the gangs â€“ one of self-reliance, peace and unity. However, Mackey and Captain Rawling are convinced that Antwon's rehabilitation is a ruse. Vic even suspects that his old partner Shane is on Antwon's payroll, but Antwon is too cagey and smart to give anything away.
