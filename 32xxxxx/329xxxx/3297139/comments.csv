,Aqueritas,2005-03-11T17:22Z,"Are we talking about this version? This is a bought PAL uk, so think again... And for the quality it is 100% of original"
,Aqueritas,2005-03-11T17:23Z,"A DVD of course... Do not critisize the source when you are unsure of it! And for the Divx version, doubt they are in better quality, since this version is digitally remastered with THX..."
,Karoly67,2005-05-08T17:44Z,Are you sure it is the digitally remastered version? It definitely does not look like it to me... 
,haggbard,2006-03-23T12:02Z,"PLease someone with a full version. SAVE ME!!!

SEED OR DIE!"
,kokoloupo,2007-05-28T18:36Z,"------TAKE THE FILE AND RUN------
That's what happens to be the motto for some people.

Several days at 97.2% stuck and no seeder with the completed torrent happens to appear.

Nice job boys!"
,kokoloupo,2007-05-28T18:41Z,"The equivalent when having sex is called ""coitus interruptus"".

Very frustrating..."
