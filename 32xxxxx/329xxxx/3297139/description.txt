"Can your heart stand the shocking facts about 
Graverobbers from Outer Space?" That's the question
on the lips of the narrator of this tale about flying
saucers, zombies and cardboard tombstones. A pair of 
aliens, angered by the "stupid minds" of planet Earth, 
set up shop in a California cemetary. Their plan: to 
animate an army of the dead to march on the capitals of 
the world. (The fact that they have only managed to 
resurrect three zombies to date has not discouraged 
them.) An intrepid airline pilot living near the cemetary 
must rescue his wife from this low-budget terror. "Can 
you prove it *didn't* happen?"

Observe: I am only able to seed between 06:30 to 22:00, SS is naturally on, so no stupid questions about why there are no seeders or if I-m super-seeding, my upload is 0,8 so it will take at least 24 hrs to dl Plan 9 from outer space
