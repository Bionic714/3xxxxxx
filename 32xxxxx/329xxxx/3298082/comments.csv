Just look at the date of the post. It's one of the oldest on tpb (2005-03-04). In 2005, when you were 20-years old, did you have fast broadband links to the Internet? This was how it was done back then...this was how it all began. Either you take it or you don't, don't make stupid comments which are out of place and out-of-time."
