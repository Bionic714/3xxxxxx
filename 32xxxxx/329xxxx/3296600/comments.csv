,Pentiboy,2005-03-01T20:35Z,Whats the meaning of unpacking it before you put it on tpb??
,bambam79,2005-03-02T09:17Z,Is this the PAL version?
,behshad,2005-03-06T23:21Z,"1. bfg_slagelse  , YOU are the one who' handicapped in the brain
2.If you want the smaller crappier version, just go download it, ignore this torrent
3.This is for pro's who want to have the exactcopy,nothing missing, not for you and your lowspeed connection

,Exoil,2005-03-12T00:48Z,"1. behshad , I think You are a bit wrong there mate...
2. What smaller, crappier version? it's the same one, the only thing that's different between the two, is that this one isn't rared...
3. I have a high speed connection, but I still look for stuffs that are rared before downloading! saving alot of precious time..
bfg_slagelse, keep up the good complaining!"
