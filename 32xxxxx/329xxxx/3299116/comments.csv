,yjyjorn,2005-03-09T16:13Z,"I fixed the problem; I replaced this copy with a backup, and now it works.  I corrupted the file, along with Xenogears Disk 2 and Dino Crisis 2.  It probably happened when I gave the confounded, malfunction, poor computer a few good knocks for not taking my keyboard commands and killing me some twenty million times in Soul of the Samurai.  Anyway, if you all say:  ""May God bless yjyjorn's computer, making it work well and protecting it from yjyjorn's wrathful knocks,"" maybe my computer will benefit and I'll be able to upload some more of whatever^_^  And my apologies for the problem (need to watch my temper)."
