Many video compression programs ask you to set many confusing technical parameters yourself. This often means that you have to spend a lot of time experimenting until you find the right settings to produce the results you want. Ashampoo Movie Shrink & Burn 2 can adjust all the settings for you. All you have to do is decide how big you want the output file to be â€“ the program then automatically calculates the right settings for producing the best quality at that file size. 

The special highlights:

1.Convert and compress your existing movie files into a selection of formats that can be played on PDAs and/or Handhelds! 
Formats for home DVD players are also available!
 
2.Burn your movie files to CDs (supports Video CDs, Super Video CDs, DivX/Xvid CDs and normal file CDs)! 

3.Let the program automatically split your movies to multiple CDs if  they are too big!
 
4.Supports XVid/DivX AVIs, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, QuickTime, WMV, Video CDs, Super Video CDs, DivX/Xvid CDs!
 
5.Convert/shrink unencrypted VOB files into smaller high-quality
formats!
