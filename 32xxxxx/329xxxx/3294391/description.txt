Ok folks, here's some rare footage of the mighty VOID, one of Washington, DC's most memorable hardcore bands of the early 80's scene. They were only around for 3 years, and this was shot during their last year. I don't know the song titles... hoping that some of you punk archaeologists can help with that. Not even sure where it was shot. I think it was Philadelphia, but I really don't know. I got this in a video tape trade 20 years ago and all I have on the tape is "Void Live." 

Please don't sell! Trade only! Play nice!
