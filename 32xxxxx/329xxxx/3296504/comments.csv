,s0n1kk1,2005-08-09T15:38Z,the seeder is back =) i found the album from my pc for a few days ago
,Akira6790,2005-08-12T23:17Z,CRAP I WAS  ON VACATION. Can you please re-seed it again. I know its annoying but people are whores and now theres no complete files again!
,Sterkenburg,2006-02-23T23:02Z,"To all:  IF YOU ARE STUCK AT 99.6%, LIKE MYSELF, YOU CAN STILL UNRAR THIS TORRENT AND GET ALL SONGS BUT THREE.

The songs you cannot get are:
10 How Many.mp3
11 Elevation.mp3 
19 All Tha Way (ft Knowmati.mp3


If you can help me, try downloading one of these songs from another source, replacing them in the RAR file, replacing that RAR file with the one your downloading program is downloading to, and seeing if your downloading program will accept the torrent (BACK UP YOUR ORIGINAL COPY!).

If not, try it with another copy of the missing songs.  This is how smart people fix torrents.  Really smart people look at the filesize of the song that is inaccessable, and download a copy with the same size.


Sorry if this is confusing.
???????????"

It says ""Sterkenburg"" in non-ASCII characters."
