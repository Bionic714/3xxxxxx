A Separate Reality: Further Conversations With Don Juan

A Separate Reality is a work that is at once the discovery of a hitherto unrecorded body of wisdom and knowledge and the story of a remarkable and shattering personal experience.

This is the second volume in the Don Juan series. The Teachings of Don Juan is the first volume.
