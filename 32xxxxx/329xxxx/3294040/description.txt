       . ..: CAST / PLOT SUMMARY :.. .   
      
   
   It is different than the three other movies but it was  
   a ending to a great series of movies. We all have to    
   realize that Stig-Helmer has matured a little and that  
   people grow old. I believe S.H. was a little more aware 
   of reality now and that's good, people change. The 
   has a lot of old characters from the earlier movies     
   wich is fun. It's really not what I expected and that's 
   good...
