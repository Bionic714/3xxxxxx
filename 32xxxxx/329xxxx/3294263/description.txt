Based on the successful novel of the same name by Marie Belloc Lowndes, the plot of The Lodger is simple.  A psychopathic killer, whose victims are always young blonde women, is on the loose in London.  The murders occur only on Tuesday evenings.  A landlady begins to wonder if  her new lodger (Ivor Novello) is the murderer.  
Although he had served as director or assistant director of several previous films, Alfred Hitchcock always referred to The Lodger (A Story of the London Fog) [Gainsborough, 1926] as "the first true 'Hitchcock movie.' "
