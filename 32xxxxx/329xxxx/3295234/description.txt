Sailor Moon Live Action. Sawai Miyuu is the live action actress of Sailor Moon in the series "Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon."

This is Miyuu's third idol DVD. 

This was filmed and released 2 years after the "Me" and "You" idol DVD releases. Miyuu has done some growing up since then and one of the things that Miyuu was set out to do through this release was to make that apparent to the viewer.

This was shot on location in Taiwan. Miyuu is of Japanese decent but this video features Miyuu adapting to the Chinese lifestyle. You'll get to listen to her speak some Mandarin, follow along with her as she models in various locations, and shops in the popular night markets. 

It should be known to the viewer that Miyuu is not completely being herself throughout the main presentation. The director's intention was to try to capture the essence of stereotypical Asian women. Every environment Miyuu is put in, she plays a particular role. 

Released by [AK] Arctic Knight Productions.
