,tribhuvanji,2009-01-11T09:49Z,"Back when it came out I liked this album - a listen after all those years is sometimes hit-or-miss,  some stuff just doesn't stand up. This LP on the other hand really has the makings of a classic. ""Nevermind the Genre, Here's the Pandoras!"" . Thanks for this. Note it's in 320k bps. PS. We're stuck at ~85%. A friendly seed would be royal ;) "
