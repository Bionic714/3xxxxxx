OK here's a real treat for everyone, 4 songs by Propaghandi pro shot from 2004. This is from the Punkervision Noisy compilation, i wish they would release the whole show, but this is better than nothing, enjoy!  

Propagandhi-Pro Shot Concorde 2 Brighton 2004 SVCD 11 Minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
