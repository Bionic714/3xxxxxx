LUNAR: Silver Star Story Complete is a remake of the classic Lunar: The Silver Star, and was released on the Playstation back in 1999. The story sets Alex and his friends, Luna, Ramus and Nall on an adventure to the White Dragon Cave in search of the White Dragon. Ramus believes that the White Dragon's Cave contains a very valuable diamond, while Alex's motives for venturing into the cave are very different from his rotund friend.

Note: guess this PSX version is called complete b/c it was released in the US in a 4 CD box including a "behind the scenes" disc and a soundtrack CD (which I don't have).
I'm just seeding the game on two CDs, so it's not really complete...but hey, if u like it you should try to find the box and buy it!

Anyway, I've patched it with a nice PAL-NTSC selector made by PARADOX, and dumped the game into BIN/CUE files. Just unrar and burn with the app of your choice.

Enjoy!
