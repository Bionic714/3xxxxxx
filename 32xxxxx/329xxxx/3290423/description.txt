From amazon.com: This set captures a still-growing Dylan on the edge, just before he makes the jump to rock & roll, continuing to expand the notion of folk music with openhearted, unprecedented compositions and performances like "All I Really Want to Do," "Chimes of Freedom," "My Back Pages," and "It Ain't Me Babe." If Dylan's previous album The Times They Are A-Changin' was a bit too literal and focused on current events, Another Side indulges Dylan's more mythic and expansive side, making more rumor for the humor that would explode when Dylan formed a band. It's just Dylan, guitar, and harmonica here, but Another Side is a rock & roll album without that band.

Note: This is an mp4 encode of the new "reissue" version of Another Side Of Bob Dylan: Sound is superior, both when it comes the remix itself and the new mp4 standard. You may have to download a plugin to play this, but windows media player usually takes care of that automatically.
