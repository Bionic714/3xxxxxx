,uhlersoth,2005-02-16T13:47Z,Can't you split it up a bit? 20Gb file is going to take about a month to download!
,gromoboi,2005-02-16T14:56Z,"Wow, Isaac Asimov's wet dream!!! :) 

Thanks mate, that stuff rocks!!!"
,sohls,2005-02-16T19:44Z,"Excellent, time to complete my collection.
Coming in with 18% already done, enjoy."
,ampeg,2005-02-17T01:29Z,"20 gigs is too much for m to download. I only have a 40 gig hardrive and it's pretty much full.

What would be great is if you could upload  500 MB's at a time.

Anyway, thanks."

Change to a client that can download the files you select and leave the rest then"
,Belnick,2005-02-19T02:28Z,umm took 16gig or something of this from the ed2k in less than a week
,ampeg,2005-02-20T09:46Z,"My client lets me download what I want. The problem is that it first loads everything and takes up whetever footprint the files are. I use Azureus and I am on a Mac so I do not have all the choices that you windows users have when selecting BT clients.

Without screenshots how will I know which files I would want to grab?"
,tvdennis,2005-02-21T12:24Z,"Way too big to download! Why not cut into pieces?
The material is really requested, but it takes too looong to download even with a good isp"
,Covenant1980,2005-02-22T15:12Z,what player you use for thes files (RM-files) to play?

,KrÃ¤ftan,2006-06-18T07:57Z,"Tack för denna torrent - men hur gör jag med rm filerna för att det ska bli något som går att titta på ??

Thanks - how to handle the rm-files ???"
,Seumas,2006-06-18T09:11Z,"If 20gb is too big for you, why don't you just download the files you want? There are about 500 or 600 individual files in it...

If your client doesn't allow you to choose what files to download, try uTorrent (if you're on Windows)."
,Seumas,2006-06-18T09:14Z,"""what player you use for thes files (RM-files) to play?""

. . . Uh . . . Real Player.

Unfortunately, due to poor business and privacy practices by Real Media in the last eight years, I refuse to install their crappy player. Otherwise I'd be all over this torrent.

There is an open Real Player alternative out there called Real Alternative, but I haven't had much success getting a lot of *.rm files to work in it."

,Renamonfan,2011-10-11T16:03Z,"Where were this originally encoded from? There are some great movies in this set, but the .rm video quality is sometimes very poor.

I don't suppose the set could be re-encoded as high-quality .mp4 by someone with the original files?

Anyway, I'll keep seeding, great fun, my favourite is possibly the Angelica Sin or Jenya ones ;)"
