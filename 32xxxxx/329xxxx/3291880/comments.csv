,Ykalon,2005-03-05T01:20Z,Would love to see this game here but in English...
,fatc4t,2005-03-06T10:30Z,"Hade varit grymt o f책 engelska versionen, riktigt sugen p책 detta liret."
,psycho89,2005-03-07T20:20Z,OK - Someone please say why a lot of releases lately are Spanish. Is this because they are better at releases or the publishers have weaker protection on Spanish versions. The latter I doubt......so why are a lot of major releases Spanish ?
,Rebl,2005-03-15T00:01Z,English version is here http://www.thepiratebay.org/download.php/3299999/03.02.05.Moment_of_Silence-MONEY.torrent
,izrail,2005-03-23T21:52Z,"I don't understand because you cannot stand the Spanish links.
I believe that you are the bad-mannered"
,Jeder,2005-05-05T18:52Z,WTF SPANISH! GO AWAY!!!
,Jeder,2005-05-05T18:54Z,"Seriusly, TPB need to put a code of conduct = English only. Im swedish but i wont speak swedish because ppl from all over the world use this site."
,zakros71,2005-06-04T14:24Z,"People, you are idiots! If you don't like spanish or german or anything else, just look somewhere else.
I suspect though that you got pissed because you downloaded the game and found out afterwards that it was the spanish version. :P

And anyway, why don't YOU upload the english version instead of writing bs?"
,ILoveYou,2005-06-05T13:47Z,"Ummm. Why would anyone download that torrent which says ""SPANISH"" ? The point is that the person who uploads these games could easilly upload the ENGLISH version. There's no point in uploading spanish torrents on swedish tracker. "
[T],repopo,2006-03-07T09:11Z,"What's the problem.  As long as it's stated on the title, so we're all warned, who minds if it's in spanish, french, hindi or zulu?  People from around the world come here, so let's share and coexist.

All that no-spanish-on-swedish-tracker sounds sooo Bush-like"
