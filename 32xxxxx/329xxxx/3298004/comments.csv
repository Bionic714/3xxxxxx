,Egal,2005-06-21T02:32Z,"All music files in this torrent have their ID3 tags filled with such things as ""no title"" and ""no artist"", which shows up in the Winamp playlist. I thought this was really annoying, but instead of just complaining I did something about it. The same albums, but with fixed tags, file names and with SFV files, can be found at:

,JokerWylde,2006-07-16T18:29Z,Please could someone seed this? Thanks
,captcpsc,2006-08-18T22:10Z,I'm going on like day 5 or something like that trying to get this file?  If anyone out there has this could they please seed it.  I am at 80.2% and have even brought a peer with me to that percentage...  I can then seed it for a while...
,captcpsc,2006-08-19T03:30Z,"The first tracker http://tracker.prq.to/announce
seems to be down.

I've added the tracker htttp://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce
but I need someone that can seed the full file on this new tracker...  Please."
,captcpsc,2006-08-19T15:43Z,Original Tracker is working again....still in need of a seed person.  Currently there is 4 of us at 80.2%...and two more trying to get to that point.
