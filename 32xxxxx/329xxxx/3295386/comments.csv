,Shalimar,2006-02-20T21:58Z,"not bad.. for a classic cartoon.

but this is NOT a dvd rip actually.. but original TV captures.. can't be a DVD rip for something never released on DVD other than one ""fan"" selling it online (which is the same sources in the end)"

,Onceler,2007-03-02T14:23Z,"it's PAL,would have been nice if they had mentioned this before I downloaded it as PAL always flickers NTSC player
it would be nice if ALL movies displayed wether they were NTSC or PAL"
