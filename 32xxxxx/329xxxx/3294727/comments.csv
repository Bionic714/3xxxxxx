,garrenn,2009-07-25T03:21Z,"Here's what I did.

First you extract the rar

If you don't have ScummVM then download that. I them copied the whole downloaded file and placed it in my Secret of Monkey Island folder located in Program Files. (I figure you can put it in any folder, but it never worked for me if I just pasted it into Program Files. If that works for you then fine)

Then you bring up ScummVM and locate the file and there you go!

Now I've never played this actual game BEFORE but there's something at the very beginning that you have to type in numbers. Dunno if you have to put something CERTAIN in that, but in case you do I watched a playthrough of the game and the person typed in 11 for both. I did the same and that worked for me.

Have fun!"
