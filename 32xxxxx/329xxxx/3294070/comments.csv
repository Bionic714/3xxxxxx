,MaxNormal,2005-06-11T14:51Z,"Another effort from the gory re-inactment society. Set in WW2 pacific camapign, with some excellent location shots. An otherwise slow film, interspersed with enough fear, sweat and blood to maintain some form of grip on the audience. Interesting use of unorthodox soundtrack, and a heavy narrative. Don't be expecting a feel good factor. The direction spares nothing in it's depicting the theatre of war as a brutal, senseless machine. Reality isn't always a pleasant dish. 

IMHO rating : 60%"
