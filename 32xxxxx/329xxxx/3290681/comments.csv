,ungern,2007-02-16T20:53Z,"I would personally like to take a professional videocamera, and SHOVE IT UP THE A*S OF THE FU*KER THAT MASTERED THIS DVD!!! Watching for 10min gave me a splitting headache, and the whole session is like this. Who the hell thinks it its impressive? Constant zoom/zoom+pan/pan and clips no longer than 2 secs all of the fuc*ing time! Bloody morons. If you want to see a good concert DVD, check out Sensation White. This is horrible Coc*suckers.
THe music in itself is very good, except for a lame live singer..."
,Sebbe2009,2009-06-16T12:26Z,What songs is it from DJ Tiesto on this dvd?
