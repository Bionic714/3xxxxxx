"Ah yes, Ruben and the Jets. Pull out your Verve vinyl, and listen to the vintage sounds of Zappa and the Mothers reconstructing their heritage of classic doo-wop and r&b.

What? Your vinyl was lost or destroyed? Your record player was donated to charity?

Well, go buy a record player and a copy of the old vinyl version of this, because the current cd is garbage!

In the mid 80's, Zappa decided that the drum and bass sounds on two of his album, WOIIFTM and Ruben, were simply not up to snuff. He made the thoroughly bizarre decision to re-record those parts with current band members.

The result is something like a modern remix of a sixties-era track - it just doesn't work. The bass and drums do things that nobody did in 1969. They simply sound wrong.

So, if you want to hear this album properly, get the old vinyl. The cd is good for a laugh, but not for much more. "


Well...here's the vinyl version.  I hope you all enjoy it. :)
