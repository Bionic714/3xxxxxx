,dvorak12345,2009-07-26T16:07Z,"Just a question: Why does the game just hang with a black screen when you start it? I've patched and cracked the installation, tried running it in compatibility mode (I'm XP by the way), and even got to the point of checking the resources it takes up on the system which is 6780 Ks and games usually have more than 250 000. What's up with this one?"

,whazzup3929,2011-01-01T18:47Z,your cd key is invalid....need to get past that in order to crack it bro....been searching for a serial...im a veteran to installing games but this has confounded me

,Reddeamon,2011-02-19T19:10Z,"If you experience the ""gc2 has stopped working"" error it's because of the Data Execution Prevention of Windows, you have to switch it off for gc2 to work. (Defining gc2.exe as an exception won't work)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Execution_Prevention

This is how you switch DEP off in Vista: (for XP you will have to edit the boot.ini if you're not sure how to do that, consult the interwebs)

The Data Execution Prevention can be switched off by starting cmd with administrator clearance and typing

bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOff

after pressing enter you have to restart the computer then GC2 should work."
,Reddeamon,2011-02-19T19:13Z,"I was addicted to the first game, and now a few years later when I built a new computer it took me a while to remember the name of the game. This shit is awesome."
,Krichek,2011-04-24T19:39Z,"Downloading torrent now some nice people are still seeding :)

Will seed for a long time if i can manage to get this to work, hopefully"
,Krichek,2011-04-24T20:56Z,"It works PERFECT...

Mount the image (.cue) with daemon tools lite

Install it with this serial SET9-GUF2-TYW5-DYW6-6689 (ty darth_3pio)

once its installed explore into the mounted disc and copy the contents of ""crack"" folder and paste them in the directory you installed THE game in

Thx great upload FiveEYZ"
,benakenobi,2012-01-08T19:01Z,wonder why my retail version is two disks and this is one
,SoupyNorman,2012-03-24T14:53Z,"I got this to work on Vista 32-bit by installing this patch (Ground Control 2 v1.0.0.6 to v1.0.0.8 Patch 2)

http://www.gamefront.com/files/3679515/Ground_Control_2_v1_0_0_6_to_v1_0_0_8_Patch_2

Then I overwrite gcii.exe with the gcii.exe from Ground Control II v1.0.0.8 [ENGLISH] Fixed EXE

http://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_ground_control_2.shtml#Ground%20Control%20II%20v1.0.0.8%20[ENGLISH]%20Fixed%20EXE

Hopefully this helps someone."

Does this mean I'm a dumb guy?"
