OK here's a great show by the band Jawbreaker which i filmed back in 1994. This is a great performance and filmed in my usual high standard, in a tiny club. The sound is great and should make everyone very happy to finally have a show worth watching. I hope you agree that this is a great show and i will be posting Schwartzeneggar as well who supported them on this tour, enjoy!

Jawbreaker-Nice & Sleazy Glasgow 22nd October 1994 SVCD 57m Minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
