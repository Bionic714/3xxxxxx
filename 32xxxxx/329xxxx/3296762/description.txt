Stealth espionage action takes to the jungles in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater for PlayStation 2 and PC. Set in what appears to be the 1960s, Snake Eater tells the story of a man who appears to be Solid Snake, but based on the time frame and information revealed in previous games, could be someone else altogether. Survival is a major theme throughout MGS3, as Snake must adapt to the harsh jungle environment, while at the same time battling enemy soldiers. Snake Eater promises a complex plot and vivid music score to rival a Hollywood blockbuster, along with and realistic graphics and high-definition sound that will take the series to new heights.
