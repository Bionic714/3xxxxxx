After a shuttle explosion in space and a meteor shower in New York, a retired navy officer, Karl (John Mahon) discovers an asteroid the size of Texas (played by itself) on a collision course with Earth. It will wipe out everything living including bacteria. There's only one thing to do - drill a hole in the asteroid, plant a nuke in it, and blow it away. To do the job, NASA administrator Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) calls upon the best deep core driller in the world, Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) who leads his team along with A.J. Frost (Ben Affleck). With only 18 days to destroy the asteroid, it's a race against time to save all creation and prevent Armageddon.
