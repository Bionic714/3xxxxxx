This is build 604 of MSN Messenger 7 Beta.  It includes a number of 
enhancements over the previous build (425).  Most notable is the    
personal message which you can set to contain a message for all your
contacts to see.  If you are running Windows Media Player v10 you can|
also enable your contacts to see what music files you are currently  
playing.  This feature was first introduced in Microsoft's 3 Degrees  
application.  Included here are 3 patches (thanks to xetrOv for them)
(1) removes the ads, (2) removes the ads and allows polygamy (multiple
copies running simultaneously), (3) removes the ads and the beta tag  
and also allows polygamy.
