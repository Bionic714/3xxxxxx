,limbaugh,2005-02-23T18:34Z,hmm jag tankar tos så fint så från dig.. tackar:D
,Haldor_D,2005-04-08T10:34Z,Season 6 DVD 5? Of what? Just wanted to make sure what the download is since TOS only had 3 seasons (as all you already know)   :-)
,Haldor_D,2005-04-13T06:58Z,"Can anyone please say what this torrent is? First bid was TOS season 2 DVD 5, which Poofh changed to season 6 DVD 5. But that doesn't exist unless it's one of the other Star Trek series. A bit confusing..."
,Haldor_D,2005-05-22T17:05Z,"Guess i'll have to answer that myself (thank you very much) after waiting for an answer a long time and then downloading it anyway (which took an even longer time).
This IS disc 5 of season 2"
