Darkseid Originals 	- ripped by me personally, quality guaranteed.
Darkseid Collection 	- stuff I got from friends or downloaded. Usually decent quality, but it may not be perfect.


This is the very first Tintin comic to be published. It is an English translation.

For various reasons, I can only seed between 16:30 GMT and 02:30 GMT. Sorry about that. Enjoy! :)
