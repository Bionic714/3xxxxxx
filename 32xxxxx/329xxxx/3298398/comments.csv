,Carry,2005-03-05T19:10Z,"Here is what MoF says themselfes about that!

NO, its not.. Don't you think we know what a Telecine is and
when to label it as one? When did company`s start to make TCs
for promotion veiw only? We label as the source is folks..

This is a Telecine cause of following reasons:

1: It's HOMEMADE, made with the help of our Partners..

2: It's got HOMEMADE audio, also made by ourselfs..
3: It didn't come from a Preveiw Company..

Why Blade Trinity is a DVD Screener:

1: We dont lie about Our sources. We label 100% according to
what the source is and as it should be.

2: Its exactly the same Quality as some of our pervious
DVD Screeners from Exactly Same Source.
3: The coming soon trailers where even left in TEGs DVDR, as
its been in previous Releases aswell.

4: Don't be stupid enough to believe we would release
telecines as DVDScreeners when they are clearly not.

5: Blade Trinity came from Preveiw Company, as a DVDSCR.
