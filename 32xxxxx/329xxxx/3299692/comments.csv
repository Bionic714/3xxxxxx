,vickyz,2005-03-09T10:15Z,thank You! :) Glad to hear!
,vickyz,2005-03-09T13:15Z,"Can someone help me with this?
I want to create a tag i.e ""surrealtorrents""  ""hardtofindmovies"" or something!
Everyone who has such movies can put this tag to the torrent to make it easier to search those movies on PB!
How do I create a tag like this? IÂ´m no einstein on computers, you know;)"
,foomonger,2005-03-09T15:32Z,"you simply add some specific text to your info, like the asian torrent dudes. whoever wants in, copies and pastes the exact same text into *their* upload page, and BallaBang! It just grows from there!

eg..

***************************************
********** FAR-OUT FREAKY FLICKS *********
***************************************

Do you like really fucked-up, weird flicks? Cool! Do ""symbolic metaphors"" give you a tingle? Does the Name David Lynch mean anything to you? Do you watch movies *just* because you can't pronounce the director's name? Join the CLUB!

But, are you worth of the title ""uploader of a*really* far-out movie!""

If you are, then come and join in! simply paste this section into your post, and other weirdos, like us, can find all the deranged and intangible imagary we need!

need to add one thing, to the end...

""... simply search for ""freakyflicks""""

note: THIS film won't appear in the search because you added the text AFTERWARDS, but all the other films containing this text will.

bring on the freakyflicks!

,laqueesciousb,2009-01-02T07:59Z,"I'm puzzled as to how to apply the subtitles to the movie. I click and I click on the .srt and get a page full of text, how do I apply this to the video I've downloaded? Are there subtitles for this movie?"
,luizfalves,2009-02-09T02:07Z,"Just in case anyone wondered, and since no one made that observation:

This copy is DUBBED in ENGLISH, it doesn't have the original Czech audio.

I'll keep this just in case, but I'll also keep looking for the original version."
,planetbleu,2009-04-14T03:52Z,"Have you ever seen the "" BROTHERS QUAY COLLECTION "" that i consider to be the best experimental stuff out there and you should check out the videos of  the industrial music band called "" PSYCHIC TV "" an "" TEST DEPT ""
  "" CABARET VOLTAIRE "" or "" SLEEP CHAMBER "" 
look for the old 80's stuff ....these days were the best experimental days and some of the industral band were making very weird stuff ,hypnotic ,dream like grainny , dirty stuff ...you can check out some videos on youtube ,i think .....give me some feedback !!!"
