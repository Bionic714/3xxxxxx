Har provat i MediaPlayer (default), QuickTime och RealPlayer. Ingen bild.
Vad göra?"
,bunion,2005-04-17T01:19Z,"The film is great, when I saw it in a theater, but dowloaded, there's no picture!!!
I've tried Windows MediaPlayer (default), and QuickTime, as well as RealPlayer, but there seems to be something wrong with the file.
Please, what to do?"

,zarniwooproosta,2010-09-30T19:57Z,Can anyone confirm whether or not this version that cuts out the song Superheroes?
,zarniwooproosta,2010-09-30T19:58Z,"hmm, it says 95 minute duration...not a good sign. This movie should be either 98 minutes or 100 minutes, depending on whether or not the song Superheroes is cut from the film "
