Help? "
,emmachristina,2009-01-20T09:46Z,"Okey, so now I've solved that problem by downloading the torrent one more time (like updating it) but when i'm installing the game, a window pops up and says ""error"" something. 

Gah, its driving me mad. "
,emmachristina,2009-01-20T09:53Z,"It says exactly:

""Component: Level 2-FullCD1
FileGroup: Full Install CD1
File: k:\video\CIN100000_Romansbourg.bik
Error: Datafel* (CRC-fel, Cyclic Redundancy check)""

* Dataerror sort of. 

And then I have to click ""ok"" and the install shuts down. "

,TheBlackWhirlwind,2010-07-26T04:56Z,"WARNING: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT! IT CONTAINS A WORM VIRUS. MORE INFO BELOW:

Hi folks I've just downloaded this torrent (Syberia.2.[PC ISO]) and upon installing the game (after mounting it with Daemon tools) Kaspersky detected a worm virus@ worm.win32.autorun.beeq

It is a very sneaky virus, as Kaspersky only detected it approximately halfway through the installation process."
