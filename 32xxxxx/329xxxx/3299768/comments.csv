,sally-eller,2005-03-10T09:26Z,Du som är så duktig och trött på folk som klagar. Varför klagar du själv då? Berätta istället hur man gör. Så slipper både du och andra mindre vetande klaga :-)
,eraza,2005-03-10T11:38Z,hahaha väldigt sant det som sally-eller säger :P
,Jeejk,2005-03-10T12:42Z,Helt fruktansvärt dålig kvalitet på den här releasen!
,iQfri,2005-03-11T14:40Z,"OMG, Kvaliteten får 0/10 av mig, så pissig :/"
,thunderik,2005-03-11T19:27Z,inte värt besväret.

,BiZaA,2005-03-12T14:57Z,"2 *.mpeg files, no compression. Lots of trouble getting you  lousy quality; much worse than svcd.
You better wait for a proper DVD rip (with eng. subtitles pls.)"
,DonCorleone,2005-03-12T23:52Z,"THE WORST VISION AND SOUNDQUALITY EVER!!!
SORRY TO SAY BUT ITS TRUE...WAiT FOR BETTER COPIES IS MY ADVISE... "
,Shikome,2005-03-13T00:23Z,"Whiners kiddies ffs :(

First off, thank you for the release.
For you that think its a bad release, dont watch it, problem solved.
(You can delete files by putting them in the trashbin and select ""empty"" btw... )
Or better yet, go to the cinema and watch it...
Or god forbide, make your own ""Better"" release...

Ps. Some of you guys/girls seem to have caps locks stuck. You might want to uncheck that."
,Shikome,2005-03-13T00:31Z,"What I mean is, this is not your local video store, this guy guives you the option to dl the file, then if its bad, dont watch it, very simple."
,boydk,2005-03-13T03:00Z,"For all of you, who are bitching about not knowing what to do with files: Go to
http://www.suprnovaforums.net
Create an account, and look in the ""How to´s"" forum. There is everything you need to know. And about the bitching of quality: Shame on you all, it´s for free, so what´s the problem??? Go upload something yourselves or shut up, håll kjæften, hold kæft, halt die klappe, yes??? :smile:"
,Wifebeater,2005-03-13T04:07Z,"Shikome, try shift+del. that way the file never goes into the trash-can. It goes straight to the bin insted"
,thunderik,2005-03-13T22:15Z,shit. synd på en film som verkar så cool. borde finnas en bättre release dock. undrar om den kommer snart. vet någon om någon bättre?
,KevD,2005-03-14T13:43Z,Shikome is an idiot
,o0oDVS1o0o,2005-03-14T18:58Z,"If someone says the movie quality and/or sound sucks.. why are they a whiner??  I would rather someone post this info so that I dont waste my time downloading... to the uploader, they receive much props for the time to upload it, ANY upload is appreciated...remember they are not the ones who made the movie or the rip, so its not a negative comment towards them.... and they shouldnt take it that way when someone posts that the movie quality is bad."
,Shikome,2005-03-14T22:13Z,"Oookej :)
I wasnt trying to insult anybody I promise :P
Was only ""defending"" the originator of this release.

Ive noticed alot of ""omg this suxx"" posts on lesser quality releases, and I only wanted to point out that none of us has payed for this, and thus cant really demand anything...

And to you who called me an idiot... how nice of you..."
,KevD,2005-03-15T01:38Z,"shikome, surely you realise that this was a wate of the guys who made its time in terms of producing and uploading or you havent downloaded it - if you haven't please do so and be equally dissapointed. I'm not knocking the guy - the thoughts there but if your gonna do something - do it properly.
(all lower case - just for you!)"
,Shikome,2005-03-15T02:25Z,"hihi thanks :)
Im hot for lowercases :)
And yea, Ive dl it and actually watched it, and I dont dispute the fact that its bad quality, but its still free :)"
,Skaterboy,2005-03-16T17:10Z,:lol: :lol:
