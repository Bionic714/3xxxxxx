SuperNintendo games is ALWAYS fun. No matter time a day, you have some kind of a feeling that you need to play those old very fun 16-bit's games.

I haven't really checked all the games, but I'd say it would be like 800 games, and many may be copys.

I also included the best SNES Emu so you can play the games too ;)
With this Snes Emu you can play online, on 2 player games. Like Turtles or bomberman (my favorites ;)). You can spend houer after houer just keeping play theese games. And the time will flew a way. 




Enjoy!
