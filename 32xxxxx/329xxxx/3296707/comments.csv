love  you for it "
,dnrtllr,2005-03-06T15:49Z,"thanks for the download,been waiting for a long time to complete season4.
do you also have season 5 - 7?
i have season 6 dics 1-6; 7th is missing i`m afraid.
hope we`ll get them all together finally."
,DogshitTaco,2005-03-07T08:30Z,"dnrtllr, DVD6 isn't the last DVD in season 4. There is number 7 also... :)"
,dnrtllr,2005-03-07T13:08Z,"well,i assumed you`ll share the last disc with us too ""dst"" instead of leaving us with another unfinished season....
so here`s my question again:
do you have other SEASONS because i`m missing SEASON 5 COMPLETELY, SEASON 6 DISC 7 AND SEASON 7 COMPLETELY!
Getting them ""all together"" in this case referred to ALL SEASONS.
so, will we??"
,DogshitTaco,2005-03-07T18:28Z,"No, i do not have all seasons(on DVD). Yet.
But i'm planning to get them.

There's your answer. Happy?"
,dnrtllr,2005-03-08T12:43Z,"happy?...hmmm i guess i should be,now that i have answer to my question.but somehow this doesn`t feel right.
but seriously i didn`t want to offend here.just wondering...:smile:.
thanx dogshitaco for season 4."
,dnrtllr,2005-03-08T13:44Z,"and by the way,when will you release disc 7?"
,soggtogg,2005-03-08T21:14Z,looking forward to the rest :)
,Gunner,2005-03-10T22:54Z,When do you think we will see disc 7 around ? :)
