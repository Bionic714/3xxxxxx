,Achtung_Baby,2005-03-11T17:14Z,"read the URL above to get a good sense about the type of criticism that are raised against the peak oil theory! Such as the rediculous idea (abiotic oil theory) that oil are somehow constantly being produced in a rate that will provide us with the oill we need -even in the future. 

Well then please explain what caused the end of (large scale commercial) oil production in the US. The abiotic oil theory is used by people who belive in the Illuminati and Santa Claus. Or in even more strange things, read this article from the same page: Some mentally deranged idiot rambling about how to mentally ""blast"" with some kind of energy beam to dissolve chemtrails! Hillarious! :D Just like the abiotic oil theory.   http://educate-yourself.org/lte/blastingchemtrails04mar05.shtml"
,Achtung_Baby,2005-03-11T17:17Z,"""The blasting technique, the generation of a clockwise-swirling bolt of energy that travels down the spine from the brain and fires out through the heart chakra has so far produced consistent results, at least for me personally. The only drawback is that you need to have a visual line-of-sight to the chemspew or else it takes much longer to clear the area, unlike a Cloudbuster which is always on, always working""

This is a big story. It's an attempt by the Illuminati, working through their number one propaganda production factory, the Tavistock Institute in the City of London, to create the illusion that the world is rapidly running out of oil and within a few short years, we will experience unemployemnt, wars, famine, and all manner of horrendous strife as a result of the fallout from the now ""rapdily vanishing"" oil supplies. It's a scam from top to bottom. If you've noticed that gasoline prices are beginning to rise at gas pumps across America, you can thank this deception for that jump in gas prices and you can also expect those gasoline prices to continue to rise over time and possibly remain at unprecedented high levels from here on out, UNLESS enough Americans wake up to this deceit and demand an end to it.

There are large numbers of people out there trying to promote this scam through books, articles, lectures, films, television and talk radio. In America, Michael Ruppert of From the Wilderness is apparently the lead disinformation meister of this flimflam. Amy Goodman of Democracy Now is a Ford Foundation & Rockefeller Foundation funded Left Gatekeeper who, with her brother, have joined with Ruppert to not only promote the Peak Oil scam, but is a regular propagandist for the Global Warming hoax fronted by Illuminatus Al Gore.

KPFK radio, a 100,000 kilowatt FM radio station out of Los Angeles, is one of the five national radio outlets owned by the Pacifica Foundation and has been unrelentingly hammering out the Peak Oil and Global Warming propagnada mantras since Ruppert kicked off this Tavistock-hatched disinformation campaing in 2004.

The only two people, that I am aware of, with any sizeable readership who have been trying to expose these outrageous lies and monstrous distortions of the facts are Dave McGowan through his newsletters and Joe Vialls in articles published at this web site. I'll use this page to post articles from writers and researchers who are trying to expose this pretense, starting with Dave McGowan and Joe Vialls. (Update: Jan 21, 2004. Found a good article exposing Ruppert from Patrick Mooney of www.unlearning.org).

,butttfukirr9,2012-03-05T00:42Z,"Just use some common sense. There are 1000's of people who work in aplethora of scientific disciplines who ahev spent their life studying ""carrying capacity"", ""peak oil"", population, mass extinction, etc. Take the time to look at the science, use your common sense & then look at simple observations of what whether is doing to the earth along with our pollution. Gortons fish sticks was in every frozen package. Not anymore. We wiped out the Cod. Along with Snapper. The planet was not meant to have 6 billion people on it living the way we do using up 80 million barrels of oil a day, and by 2040 using basic arithmetic of the exponential function tells you by 2040 world population will double. Thats 2x as much resources we will be asking the panet to give us. Oh but resources are endless. You believe that crap, then you will reap the wild wind of ignorance not to have developed a plan for powering down your own existence. Like Derrick Jennsen, I told hi m when Mad Max world finally hits reality, the leaders will nuke the world and make it uninhabitable for life for thousands of years-imagine the rush they'll get from that. And if you think our leaders are not nuts enough to do stuff like that then read the Northwoods letter to JFK, Google it ol. Or what Nixon said to Kissinger about nuking Viet Nam. or when Col. North recommended to Regan to nuke El Salvado and almost did it. Get a grip people-what you all don't realize how scince fiction has no ladder to rise to what real life will do to you when gtangsters run the asylum as they do. You proubably lived your life tucked into bed ea night with mommy kissing your butt in some gated community to hide you from all the boogeyman's out to get you in the neighborhood.

 Die motherfucker! 

Your gonna die anyway when you get old, hit by a Mack truck, get caught in a log chipper & pulled in as my brother did and got munched out in a million pcs of bone chips & ragmented pieces of goo."
