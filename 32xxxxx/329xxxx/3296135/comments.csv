You're as visible as you were before. Don't fall for this kind of crap."
,pubbie,2005-02-28T12:59Z,"Connections are bounced via others connections, the bandwith is thus VERY limited, not to mention the encrypting of all traffic. http://www.i2p.net/"
,bobhund82,2005-02-28T14:13Z,"Ok, read the thread.. See that this thing is said not to work.. Anyone got a tip for me on this prob: My stupid mf ISP (SUNET, student-piss network) is shutting me of from the network, if I ""Spread copyright material bla bla bla.. How do I get them to lay off my back? Anyone?"
,DizzyPoet,2005-02-28T14:43Z,"I was going to say call me when they get to V1.0 , but this is from their website 

""Note that it is likely that there are bugs in the software and there has been insufficient peer review to date. People should not use I2P prior to the 1.0 release without understanding the risks of their actions.""

I understand the risks and will wait , Thank you very much .

BTW current version .5.X.X "
,Panorama,2005-02-28T14:55Z,"jag vet att folk anslutna till sunet via lunds universitet använder sig av LUDC som är en direct connect klient som fungerar inom själva universitetsnätverket. Det lär fungera bra och filer som finns på ""riktiga"" nätet letar sig in även på detta nätverk. lycka till!"
,grovskopa,2006-06-08T13:02Z,Man kan inte komma runt det om man sitter på SUNET. De avlyssnar trafiken och man blir ganska fort avstängd.
