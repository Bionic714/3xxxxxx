<b>Dead Friend | Korea 2004 | Horror | Eng Sub</b>

"Dead Friend" stars Ha-Neul Kim as Ji-won, a college student who doesn't remember much about her past. She's suffering from amnesia, and visits to her doctor haven't yielded any results. Ji-won lives with her creepy mother in a creepy old house, and when her ex-classmates from high school start dying one by one, Ji-won believes someone, or something, is coming after them. As Ji-won begins an investigation, she comes across Mi-kyeong (Yi Shin), another one of her ex-classmates, who is currently hospitalized and refuses to touch or drink water. And how exactly does Ji-won's ex-friends keep dying? Well, they all seemed to have been...drowned?

<b>Comment:</b>

<i>Without a doubt, the best Korean Horror movie I've seen so far. This movie is creepy, has nice effects, and actually has a story which is understandable and doesn't have a deranged theme. I mean, you don't have some whining ghost who was cheated by her boyfriend or a schizophrenic girl having fits. This movie has a ghost whom I can actually sympathize with.

Like other Asian horror films, this film is more creepy than scary. The atmosphere makes you tense. The sound effects and the theme of water is enough to give you the creeps. And the acting, though not top-notch, is enough to satisfy you. 9/10

En riktigt kuslig film med läskig atmosfär och stämning, även om den lånar lite från både Ring och A tale of two sisters så gör den det bra. Rekommenderar likväl denna starkt!
