The story, loosely, is about an alchemist (played by Jodorowsky) who gathers some followers to accompany him to the Holy Mountain to seek eternal life. On the way we are told by various gods how life is on their particular planets, and it is different on each planet with outlandish environments and characters on each one. Just watch this film with your mind wide open and let it astound you. It certainly will. It is one of the most surreal and bizarre films you will ever see.
