,HungryHeffer,2005-04-18T05:08Z,I don't have a lot of experience with this sort of thing and was wondering if anybody knows how to get this program to work? Am I supposed to move the language files somewhere? If somebody could post a solution I'd really appreciate. 
,rurach,2005-05-21T23:06Z,how should i burn the languagecd??
,lightbearer,2005-05-30T17:25Z,"First you need to extract the iso files and then burn the contents of the files to a cd (not the folder that was created with everything in it, but its content). You also need to do the same with the application image."
,Ayo,2005-06-22T17:41Z,Has anyone got Rosetta Stone for Indonesian? Thanks.
,johannes1984,2005-06-23T19:53Z,"I have now installed the rosetta stone. However, when I try to run it, a window pops up which says ""Searching for language CD-ROM""  what should I do now? Please explain as detailed as possible. "
,jmmnycrckt,2005-06-24T01:19Z,"This has several different languages however, the lessons are incomplete in that the different level of Rosetta Software comes with 9 - 10 separate units for each level. The languages in this one are only level 1 and only have 2 units a peice. 

Don't get me wrong I appreciate this upload. Just would have like to know before I dl for hours on end. 
Cranial2....You rock for this one and any other Rosetta ones you put out....consider it as you doing the world a favor....Breaking language barriers one Upload at a time.
You should get the Nobel for this! "
,johannes1984,2005-06-25T23:33Z,Nevermind. I finally made it work. :)
,SarcophilusSatanicus,2005-07-20T08:01Z,"I burned all the un-rared files to a cd, and then ran the autorun on the cd. It installed and worked, and worked for a time. Then i played some Battlefield 2 and inserted the CD for that. And I was able to run it without the disc for some time. All of this was today btw, and now When it starts up i get, a Data CD in drive N cannot be used with this version of the program."

However, when I try to run it, a window pops up which says ""Searching for language CD-ROM"", what should I do now?. "" But, I can't solve it on my own!! I really, really need some help. Please guys...."
,Spike85008,2007-06-23T13:38Z,Hey Kyar you can find Hebrew in the file Rosetta Stone Documents - 53 - Learning
,Rockerx,2007-07-06T09:46Z,"Hi missuna!! This is what to do,oky you have installed main program to The Rosetta Stone,so far so good!When you run it it will automaticly search for the language disc...If it not find it you will get that pop up widow from windows...Her what to do:You take the dowloaded fil which probaly a iso image,if so just open f.ex nero burning rom and use burnimage to cd... Then you burn it to cd-r about 80 min 700MB.Now put the new disc back into the pc and run the program on more time whith the disc in cd/dvd rom and it will find the languge file if you do all right... Enjoy!!!"
,fingerdrop,2008-08-13T05:40Z,I don't seem to have an iso image.  Any ideas?  I can't get it to read any of the discs I've burned.  Coasters!
