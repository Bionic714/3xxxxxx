These are language files. Not sure whether the inbuild setup will work, if it doesnt you'll have to download the Rosetta APPLICATION DISC (110mb) seperately. I have uploaded v1.5 because that is the only one which doesnt give me a 'not licensed' error. 

application disc torrent is here:

also mind this: if you get a 16-bit error when running setup then : 

copy the AUTOEXEC.NT file from c:winntrepair to c:winntsystem32

I have also uploaded Korean, Japanese and Chinese level II
