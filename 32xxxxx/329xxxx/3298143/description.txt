I like chess-related movies (Dangerous move, Searching for Bobby Fischer) and that's why I watched this film, not knowing what a hauntingly beautiful, heart-wrenching love story it turned out to be. <p>

Summary from IMDB:
"Set in the late 1920s, The Luzhin Defence tells the story of a shambling, unworldly chess Grand Master who arrives in the Italian Lakes to play the match of his life and unexpectedly finds the love of his life. Discovering his prodigious talent in boyhood overshadowed by his parents' failing marriage, Luzhin's lyrical passion for chess has become his refuge and rendered the real world a phantom. Already matched up by her family to the very suitable Comte de Stassard, when Natalia meets Luzhin, she is drawn to the erratic genius and offers him a glimpse outside of his chess obsession. But it is a world he is not equipped to deal with and his two worlds collide to tragic effect."<P>

If you like your movie with a strong story and extraordinary performances then I'd recommend you seeing The Luzhin defence.<P>

Black has just moved the rook, seemingly wanting to sacrifice it! But for what purpose ? Will White fall for it ?  If White takes the rook (out of greed and overconfidence) can you guess Black's fatal next moves?
