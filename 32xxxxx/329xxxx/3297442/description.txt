The torrent includes a sample.
I chose matroska as a container to be able to use Ogg Vorbis for sound (which is proven to be much better and higher quality than mp3 for a much smaller size).

1 note, the subs are included in the files (aka they are there, you just need to enable them from the player to be able to see them).

Leave some feedback about the quality (in english please), if you guys like it i can rip other movies.

Q&A............:
Why matroska? Because it's a very flexible format with amazingly low overhead and avi must die.
How to play this? the matroska codec pack @ http://packs.matroska.org/ or VLC @ http://www.videolan.org
Why not AC3? Because I don't have 6 speakers.
Why not mp3? Because Ogg Vorbis is higher quality  for less size, aka more bits for the video.
How to go through chapters? Not sure on windows, maybe with ZoomPlayer or VLC.
Why re-release? Bordom, I love this movie and most 2CD releases didn't do the video quality right because of the AC3 sound which makes video smaller.
Does this work on mac? i'm not sure, 90% sure it works with VLC, please tell me if not.
Why downsampling the audio? because the human-ear can't notice the difference at that quality.
