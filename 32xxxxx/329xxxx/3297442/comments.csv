,OneOfOne,2005-03-09T18:02Z,"haha.
still no news about my dvd, mail from the US to egypt is rather slow :p
my main drive just bombed out and trying to get new drive big enough to clone the partition (140gb) to try to recover my stuff :-/
but until then, I just shoot tons and tons of people. (enemy-territory for life!)

,OneOfOne,2005-03-14T22:32Z,"Well.... due to the harddisk problems i don't have enough space to actually rip it so gonna have to wait for a while until i get another one.

,OneOfOne,2005-05-16T01:24Z,"Did you read the nfo? ;)
use VideoLanClient http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ or download the matroska codec pack and play it in any regular window media player http://packs.matroska.org/
and expect the matrix reloaded very soon :D

,OneOfOne,2005-05-18T04:29Z,"Oldest version? huh? been a while since i used wincrap but pretty sure if you install the codec pack it'll work on any DirectX-compatible player (aka wmp9, wmp10, mpc, mplayer6, etc,etc)
