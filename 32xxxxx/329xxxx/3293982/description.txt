By request, the dubbed soundtracks have been omitted.


Why did it take so long time between this and the other release?
Because ppl didn't seed one of my old TNG's, and i know how it feels to sit with a 56% finnished TNG with no seeds. :(
Please make sure you are not the only seeder when you stop seeding!
If i have to go back and seed all my old TNG's, there will be no new ones.
