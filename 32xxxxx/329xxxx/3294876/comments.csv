,syllogist,2005-02-28T03:03Z,"part043.rar is stuck at 95.8% for me, with the overall download at 99.9% :( What's worse is that the incompletion was located on the ""In the Pale Moonlight"" track and it won't play past chapter 1 :(:(. If someone who has part043.rar would be so kind as to send it to me, or put it up on an ftp or http, please e-mail me at pinocytosis@sympatico.ca"
,syllogist,2005-02-28T13:44Z,You can disregard the aforementioned problem as I have now been able to acquire the download in its entirety by switching clients.
