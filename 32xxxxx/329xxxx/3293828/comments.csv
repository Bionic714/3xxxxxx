Almost completely forgotten in the land of their birth except by a handful of obsessives (half of whom are in jail or on remand)... skrewdriver were one of the most incompetent acts to have ever 'graced' a stage... lyrics written on barmats, only half-remembered and blurted out as if the 'meant' something... delivered with all the panache of a bulldog chewing a wasp...

Pathetic little men - they make such a desperate noise, because they have nothing to say."
,sonik69,2005-02-22T22:39Z,"and it's not event descent music too...

sloppy played, infantile lyrics, bad sound

gee, why does anybody bother to upload this?"

I would love a detailed exposition and explanation of the above statement... please, alert me to those values we so lack... 

A short essay on the definition of Morals and Ethics for tomorrow morning, if you would... just sign it with an X.

Ian Stuart was going nuts towards the end and gettin involved with weird stuff like military groups but I had given the security job up long before things got out of hand.

Last time I saw Ian was when he was on the run, didn't even know he died till recently.

Any south or east londoner would have told the same story, it wasn't just the white people who were being racists, racism exists on both sides and isn't exclusively white.

Look at both sides of the coin and what life was like in thiose days before claiming evil was on one side, I was stabbed simply because I was white, up to that point I had no problems with colour, that stabbing changed things for a long time.

 (i don't like the lyrics either, but that's just a bonus ;-)"
