,sysdrone,2011-05-26T10:36Z,"this movie is so stupid... I downloaded it because it appeared in the mockumentary page on wiki... first it assumes that 9/11 was committed by cave dwellers when obviously explosives (not jet fuel) brought down the 3 buildings that day... then I laugh as the night shots are all using tracer rounds... then the scene in the cave where the main character is shooting the AK and filming at the same time... 
I think the documentary loose change final cut is a much better use of bandwidth... oh well thanks for seeding so I could preview this crappy flick... "
