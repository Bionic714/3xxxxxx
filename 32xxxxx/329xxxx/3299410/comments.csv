,mrkim,2005-03-09T13:47Z,split them up to tracks?? .. then it wouldn't be a mix.. ;)

I´ve listened to your mix now and I must say that you have made a great selection of songs. HOWEVER some of the transactions are´nt flawless because the two tracks doesn´t fit so well. Ex. First L&M Remix -> Rain down on me (Tiësto Remix)... So you should think about that. Anyway I think you've got potential :)!
