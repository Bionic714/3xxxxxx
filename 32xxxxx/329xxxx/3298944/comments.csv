,aznvfgirl,2006-04-01T05:25Z,Not a very good dvd rip. Somebody should've cleaned their dvd's before ripping them. They skip like hell and it's impossible to navigate to the part you want.
,Johosc,2006-04-16T02:58Z,"Sorry, it's not chaptered like a DVD rip should be; it's straight video files I'm afraid. However, they don't skip at all on any of my systems. Check your codecs?"
,baldie_,2006-05-11T20:30Z,"Good rip, thanks.  the guys who say they skip are morons who need to learn how to install a codec .. fucking idiots."
,PsychoGo,2006-05-17T13:20Z,Thanks for the Buffy. =D
,whither,2006-05-31T10:33Z,"Can we get more seeds, please? Thanks in advance!"

,alisson,2006-07-03T18:25Z,ursäkta men är det inte mer avsnitt än så här på första sesongen. För jag får det inte att stämma när jag börjar titta på andra sesongen och om det finns fler avsnitt kan du lägga upp en länk ä du snäll.....      tack på förhand

,greylion,2008-08-09T13:59Z,"Strange why this is so popular.
One of the few TV-series I got tired of during 2nd season.
Don't get me wrong; the first season was good, but this hits very low on the entertainment-meter."
,texassy,2008-10-07T13:23Z,NOT DVDR but a rip - mislabeled. Should be Video > Movies.
