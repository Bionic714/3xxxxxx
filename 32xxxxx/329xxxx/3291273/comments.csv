,dreary79,2005-02-17T16:35Z,I didn't think I could get banned for that.  I just added the free ipod docs to help me get an ipod.  The game is for real.  A great game at that.  If I get banned I guess I'll find another place to up TG-16 CD games.

,pogojoe,2005-02-22T16:08Z,"""Note! Spamming, for example by uploading GET FREE ELECTRONICS!!!11 bullshit, will get you banned permanently from both the web and the tracker. Yes, once is enough, and you will never be unbanned.""

Det står på första sidan, hur kan du då tro att du inte blir bannad?"
