,rounder,2005-08-14T09:07Z,"I just used this application to help a friend with a brand new laptop that came configured with Win XP Home, and a 100GB disk with two FAT32 partitions. I used Partition Magic to change my friends comp to have only one partition, and then changed the file system to NTFS (FAT32 sucks big time if you have files over 4GB in size)anyway, everything went well, and we didn't lost a single byte or had to reinstall anything. great application. thx for sharing!"
