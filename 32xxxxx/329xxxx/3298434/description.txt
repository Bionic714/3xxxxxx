    Game Notes:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Casino, Inc is about to get bigger and better with the release of

    'The Management' expansion pack.



    All the features and options available in the original Casino, Inc game

    are still there, plus any amendments included in subsequent patches.

    Konami made 'The Management' a little bit harder than the original

    game, because they figured that if you'd finished it and want more,

    you probably want more of a challenge next time.



    Game Features:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * Three brand new cities, Cashmore Heights, Dollarington and Chip City.



    * New attractions including Video Poker, Cocktail Bars and Lap

      Dancing Booths.



    * New performers including Fire Breathers, Jugglers and Snake Charmers.



    * New casino themes, including Centurion's, Polar's and Cleo's.



    * New convention types including Hippies, Wizards & Witches, and Wild

      Animals!



    * New types of objectives.



    * Full sandbox mode.



    * Hitmen can now be any visitor type - that old lady could be packing

      a pistol!



    * Hitmen can plant bombs.



    * An even tougher challenge!
