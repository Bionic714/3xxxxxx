My 'Early Music' collection, ripped with Exact Audio Copy and compressed with LAME (VBR).  The earliest music is from 1950 BC (the oldest music with notation, from a cave in Egypt, track 20, about 43 seconds, on the album 'Music of the Ancient Sumerians, Egyptians, and Greeks'). The latest is from the Renaissance in Northern Europe (except for 3 tracks of John Kenneth Tavener on one of the 'In Nomine' albums. How did those get in there?).

I've stopped seeding all my other torrents (that are fully distributed) and promise that I will not seed anything else until this torrent, and my Béla Bartók torrent, are fully distributed with multiple seeds!
