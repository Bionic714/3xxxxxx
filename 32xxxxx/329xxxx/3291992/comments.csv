,HippieDrugge,2005-04-21T15:29Z,"Been waiting for some time now, can´t anyone plz seed some..? Thanx..."
,hurrumpo,2005-07-29T19:06Z,"please, anybody... there are about 10 downloaders who need just 0.1%... 99.9% is ust agonising to be stuck at!!!! any help appreciated!!"
,bubbieland,2005-08-07T19:31Z,"Også her står jeg fast på 99,9%.. 

It is GODDAMN annoying.. 

Vær så snill å seeda.."
,klaphat,2005-08-17T16:26Z,Please seed! 99.9% like the others
,karaite12345,2006-04-30T03:34Z,I burned it with Nero with the 99.9% it is complete it has Hogan in the end waving the flag and it says Titan Sports. So nothing is missing maybe only the Silverstar S symbol? The problem is Royal Rumble 1990 all that is available so far is 97% and I would guess part of the last matches ending is missing. Please seed RR 90??
,realghostbuster,2006-09-11T19:00Z,"PLease keep seeding this and the other rumbles, so close!"
,poobah,2007-01-18T14:27Z,Please seed stuck at 99.9%
,xtravis,2007-02-18T02:28Z,Any chance someone could seed.  I've had it stuck at 99.9% for the last week or two.
,bdish,2009-02-04T02:27Z,"Royvedas,

I appreciate you upping these classic WWF files, but I've got stuck in the high 90% for 2 separate files. It's garbage.

BEWARE POTENTIAL DOWNLOADERS"
