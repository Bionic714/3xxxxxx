,regular_john,2005-02-28T08:50Z,would it be possible to download smaller files say ~350MB in size? 500MB is a little too big imo.

,bjjo,2005-02-28T15:27Z,"Hello there! The reason for these episodes being ~500 MB in size, is mainly that the first season of CSI was filmed in 4:3 format, and not in widescreen.

This makes the resolution 640x480 instead of the usual 624*352. You have a point - but there's always the choice of quality vs. size vs. resolution - and most users will enjoy the DVD quality and crisp picture of these releases.

For the following seasons, which were filmed in widescreen, the file sizes will be somewhat smaller. :)"
,regular_john,2005-02-28T17:26Z,"ok, thanks for the reply :)"
,bjjo,2005-02-28T20:10Z,"That's unlikely, as that would mean a pan-and-scan of the original aspect, which in place would mean that the source would be cropped. :)"
