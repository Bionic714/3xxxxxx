,kaptainsteve,2005-03-06T01:20Z,"this album is GREAT!

Marriott and Shirley went to the record label in NY one friday looking for a contract and they were told come back monday with a hit single and  you got it.  That single was the awesome Fool For A Pretty Face.

The music on this one is raucaus and raw and so is Marriott's voice, burnt out from non stop touring the pub circuit.

I love this album!
