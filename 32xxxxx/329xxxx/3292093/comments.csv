,v1976ra,2009-06-20T02:51Z,"Dude, I really don't think Pantera performed songs in anything other than English. It's pretty rare to hear translated music. Even in countries like Japan and Korea where they can't understand 95% of the lyrics, they'd still prefer it that way, rather than have it dubbed over. I'm not trying to make you look or sound stupid, but think before you ask questions like that. "
