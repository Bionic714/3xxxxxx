GOOD MOVIE, DOWNLOAD THESE MOVIES"
,CountBlah,2006-06-05T08:37Z,"It seems that this file's embedded subtitles (not for dialogue, but for events taking place) are in German.  Such as at 2 minutes 45 seconds in, ""Eingang zum Hive unterhalb von Raccoon City"" (Entrance to the Hive below Raccoon City).  I just started watching it, so I don't know how many parts of the movie are like this.  The audio is in English, so it shouldn't bother most people."
