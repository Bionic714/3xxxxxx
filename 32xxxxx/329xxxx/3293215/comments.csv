After it is installed remount the iso and select browse the CD. find the crack and replace the original nfshp2.exe in C:/Program files/EA/Need for speed hot pursuit 2 with the cracked one.
After this is done. You need to copy the following files from the CD to the same directory.                                    
    * Actors

http://www.gamershell.com/download_1126.shtml

Then use the nocd from game copy world.

http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?f=dinocd_nfshp2_242!rar

    * Install the game - Full Installation.
    * Apply the official NFS: Hot Pursuit 2 v242 Patch.
    * Replace the original NFSHP2.EXE file with the one from the File Archive.
    * Copy the following directories from the CD to the game directory:
          o actors
          o AI
          o Audio
          o Cars
          o Movies

when i try to install, nothing happens. I checked with task manager and found out that the program was automatically quitting...

note- i have tried everything. redownloading the torrent, opening it with winrar, mounting it with daemon tools and opening up the autorun files and setup files...for some reason nothing happens. when i double click NFSHP2.exe, it tells me to insert correct cd.

I mounted the iso to the virtual drive that daemon tools installed. if i am supposed to install this to a cd, well i only have dvd's. do dvd's work or does it have to be a cd.

i am new to pirate bay and am trying to figure things out..please go easy on me..

,AMWMEMBER1,2010-08-16T21:03Z,well the game creators used alot of programming to make a small game. Mostly installation files are the reason why the disc is so large. This goes for any other games out right now. No one can really create a game disc that is smaller than the game itself.

Did the copy from mounted disc to folder to make the crack work.
