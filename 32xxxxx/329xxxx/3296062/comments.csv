,ilcapoditutticapi,2008-09-14T21:22Z,"If you are a newbee in this world, just as I was a month ago, you may be helped to know some ways to get a nice DVD.

1. Superb
An ISO file. This is an exact bit by bit copy of the original DVD (an it has the same size, so a lot of downloading).
The handling is very simple: use Nero, backup's, burn an image (that's the ISO file) to disc. Done? Then you have a DVD with all menus, subtitles and spoken languages.

2. Very good
Not so difficult at all, you have just to know. Make a directory (like MOVIE-XXX) with two subdirectories: one AUDIO_TS (leave it complete empty) and one VIDEO_TS (put all te files in it). Usually VOB (Video OBject ? the movie itself), IFO (InFOrmation like audio & subtitle info) BUP (BackUP ? reserve IFO) Use Nero, make a DVD video, point to the directory MOVIE-XXX), burn and you have the complete DVD with all adds.

3. Good
Often you get DIVX files. The size about 800 Mb gives an idea of low resolution. Nope, it means very good compression. Import in in Nero and it explodes to 4.5 Gb of good quality. However after a succesfull burning session: no subtitles. Play it at your PC, no subtitles. Often you get a small file with a RAR extension. First find the WINRAR software. Not at a commercial site (only 30 day usage or so), just with ThePiratebay or Isohunt. WINRAR is like ZIP, a packing/compressing program. Unpacking gives you two files, one .sub and one .idx. Both must have the same name as the video file an must be in the same directory. So Movie.avi, Movie.sub and Movie.idx in one dir. Now you have subtitles when playing the movie at your PC. Still not on DVD. If your lucky, the seeder gave you a .srt
Must be in the same dir as the avi (give it the same name as the .avi, just to be sure). Don't use Nero, however ConvertXtoDVD. First download this from Piratbay/Isohunt (else you get an nice logo ""buy this software"" in your movie). Point ConvertXtoDVD to the appropriate directory and burn. You get a kind of menu when playing the DVD at your TV to make choices for spoken and subtitle languages.
Waouw, mustn't get worse! 
If didn't get a .srt file, you may find it at opensubtitles. Be aware: sometimes it is not sunchronized with your movie. The more the file name looks like your avi filename, the bigger the chance it is in sync.

4. Improve your knowledge of the spoken English

5. Forget all other types of files, takes a lot of time, offers only a bad mood.

Tip: buy an rewritable DVD, experiment, if the result is satisfying, make a diskcopy with Nero.

Software
Nero ? use version 7, performs everthing, not heavely protected like version 8.
RAR
Vobsub ? display subtitles when playing at your PC (run it onc, kind of codex add-on to your mediaplayer)
ConvertXtoDVD

Sites
www.thepiratebay.com torrents, movies, software
www.isohunt.com like the pirate bay
www.afterdawn.org loads of information how to burn, convert, and so on
www.opensubtitles.org to get subtitles in case the seeder did not enclosed it
