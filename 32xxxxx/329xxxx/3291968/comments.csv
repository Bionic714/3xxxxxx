,kel-fbs,2006-01-13T23:40Z,"I've had a look and I'm affraid that the one that you are currentely downloading is actually a repack. You can see this by checkinfg the .nfo and the .sfv files and you will see that the dates are completely differant.

Although you will have to download it all over again if I upload a torrent, I think it would be worthwile to know that it is an original release and not a repack that could have errors in the compression."
