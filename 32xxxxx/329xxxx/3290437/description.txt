    [ Plot 

      Maximus is a powerful Roman general, loved by the people and the 
      aging Emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Before his death, the Emperor chooses 
      Maximus to be his heir over his own son, Commodus, and a power 
      struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death. The 
      powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will 
      allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he 
      dies. The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the 
      top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will 
      feel his revenge.
