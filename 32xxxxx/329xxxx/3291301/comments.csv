,Zarggg,2006-06-08T05:24Z,"If this is the torrent I think it is, this is the original anime series with two sets of subs: A chinese translation and a (bad) english translation of the chinese.

Of course, I haven't been able to download it again to confirm, and the ""view files"" option isn't working."
