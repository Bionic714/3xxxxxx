The best concerts from the world tour of 1966: The acoustic set of the Gaumont, Sheffield and the electric set of Odeon, Liverpool. The sound quality is perhaps not quite as good the official Bootleg Series Vol. 4, but its close. And the performances are even better: Check out Like A Rolling Stone and I Dont Believe You for sheer explosiveness.  - On disc 1 is a few tracks from Dylans film of the tour, Eat The Document, which I will upload at some point soon.
