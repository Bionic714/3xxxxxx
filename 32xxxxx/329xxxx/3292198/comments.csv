I think he´s the best striker in the world. There is no one that´s so fast and looks so confident when running with the ball...
What I don´t understand is why he hasn´t got the price for best player in the world yet...."

,sping,2006-06-21T19:50Z,"I really don't care if he's a crap player or not. If he can do some spectacular shit on video - I like him. Players like C. Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Ibrahimovic are often much more entertaining than crucial for the game itself. Tricks these kind of players can throw when you least expect it - that's what I really like in high-class soccer."
