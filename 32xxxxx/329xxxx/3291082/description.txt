Known problem:

Memory bug.
If you get the following error message:

"Error
Myth does not have enough free memory swap space to launch. Try closing any other application you have open or freeing up more hard drive
space and trying again."

*You probably have 1GB of RAM or more.*
Whatever you do, don't free up memory. Instead, make sure you have LESS than about 650MB of free memory. 
(Start up other programs until free memory reaches below about 650MB, maybe there's another solution, but I'm not aware of it)

That should do the trick
