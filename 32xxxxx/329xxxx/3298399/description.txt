well this is the album that put Tommy on the map he's on 4 out of 6 tracks here and you will tell what ones too. Its not a ROCK album its a JAZZ FUNK album well its proggessive anyway. It includes STRATUS what was a track on the LIVE AT EBBITS FIELD 74 album. It is said this is the album that DAVID COVERDALE heard on their hunt for a replacement for RICHIE BLACKMORE in DEEP PURPLE. its a must for Bolin fans to see the alternative Bolin
