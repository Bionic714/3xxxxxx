<b>One Nite in Mongkok - Hong Kong 2004</b>
  After the celebrated triumph of "Lost in Time", Hong Kong filmmaker Derek Yee returns with a story that is grittier and a whole lot messier than his previous award-winning film. The location this time around is Mongkok, known as the most populated city in the world. It's here that Lai Fu (Daniel Wu), an uneducated villager from Mainland China, arrives to carry out an assassination on the behest of a Mongkok crime lord. But Lai Fu has an ulterior motive: he's seeking a young woman name Sue, the love of his life, who came to Mongkok and hasn't been heard from since.
  As Lai Fu maneuvers through the foreign confines of Mongkok, he comes into contact with Dan (Cecilia Cheung), a young prostitute who, as luck would have it, is from the same village as Lai Fu. With many more trips to Mongkok under her belt, Dan is used to the hustle and bustle of the city, and after Lai Fu saves her from a violent john, she agrees to help him transverse the alleyways and crowded streets in search of Sue. Unbeknownst to them, cops led by Milo (Alex Fong) are after Lai Fu, hoping to head off a gang war if they can catch the hitman before he fulfills his contract.
