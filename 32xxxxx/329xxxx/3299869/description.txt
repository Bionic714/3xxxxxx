Alright here is one of my all time favourite shows, this is a fucking insane NOFX show i shot back in 1994. This is probaly one of the last ever NOFX shows in a small venue. Fat Mike has his leg in plaster and the crowd is insane, El Hefe tries to speak scottish and they even do S & M Airlines. This is one show everyone must get, its filmed in my usual high stadard and i guarantee the drunken madness will have you laughing out loud. I hope you enjoy this half as much as the crowd does!
