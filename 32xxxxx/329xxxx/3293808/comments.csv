,DomanR,2005-02-22T22:09Z,Do you think that somebody will download 12GB if he wants only one of the movies? What's the point putting 3 DVDs under one torrent?
,DieBratwurst,2005-02-22T23:13Z,This must be the craziest torrent I have ever seen... 
,timtin,2005-02-22T23:20Z,:) Grym box!!! Finns den att köpa på retail??? :)

,mathsped,2005-02-23T11:07Z,"And how hard can it be to write a bit of info about the release, like what subs, format etc. ??"
,hyper81,2005-02-23T14:26Z,hvis man legger ned denne torrent så reservere man 12gb på hd. så enkelt er det

For those of you complaining....how hard is it to pick the files you want and leave the rest?

It's not possible in yABC"
,Saverok,2005-02-23T20:38Z,Det är väl bara att välja i klienten vilka filer man vill ha. LAMERS...
,Ville_E,2005-02-23T20:46Z,Och hur gör man det i Auzurus?
,DomanR,2005-02-23T21:35Z,"Exactly... not every torrent client let you to choose files to download. And not everybody knows that there is such option.

,johnson84,2005-02-27T11:17Z,try the bitcomet client with that one u get to chose witch files to download.
,TixUs,2005-03-01T17:25Z,"Hvorfor ikke bare bruke BitComet...
Der kan man veldig enkelt velge hvilke filer som skal lastes ned, og hvilke du vil la være...

 + Det er en drit-bra client!"
