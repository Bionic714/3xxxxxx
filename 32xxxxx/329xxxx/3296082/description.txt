In the early 1980s, Madness were one of the most popular bands in Britain; their zany style and dedication to fun shined through in their music resulting in a number of hits. This excellent compilation contains 22 of their earlier singles: from the bouncy "One Step Beyond" to "Baggy Trousers", the jerky "House of Fun" and "It Must Be Love". These were all short, jaunty tunes with lyrics about real life--sometimes amusing, sometimes sombre in tone, but always grounded in the real world. This CD is an excellent introduction to a band that was very much a product of their time.
