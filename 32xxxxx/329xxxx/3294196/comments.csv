,dannychris,2010-04-08T21:27Z,"Some Kind of Monster is a 2004 American documentary film featuring the heavy metal band Metallica. It shares its name with a song from Metallica's 2003 album St. Anger.

What began[citation needed] as a simple documentary about the making of St. Anger turned into a much more personal[citation needed] exploration of the band's relationships with each other, and their struggles with the creative process. The film shows many studio rehearsals and fragments of concert footage. It won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature.

The DVD release was handled by Paramount Pictures, whose 2000 film Mission: Impossible II featured a song by Metallica.


Danny A Must Watch Thanks...."
