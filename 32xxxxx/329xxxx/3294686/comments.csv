,vinryk,2005-02-25T11:16Z,Thanks again for the great release. Can we look forward to season 3 as well?  :-)
,mischa,2005-02-25T19:56Z,"I will upload season 3 as well. 

About the subtitles: I bought the box-set in London and the only subs included were Eng+Swe+Ita. In my release I have kept the Swe+Eng subs and the English audiotrack only.

Sorry about the lack of finnish subs but...  ""This is who we are"" ;)"
