Currently, on August 7th, I am also the only seeder."
,kingofallworlds,2006-08-10T09:50Z,"Sorry, I thought this was an ePSXe game. How can I load my data from before? Others have the same problem with not being able to load their previous data. All it says it 00_waiting room. If you know how to fix, please comment, it will be thanked."
,Atilla The Nun,2006-09-25T01:13Z,"Mmm, the aptly named 'Forever Zero' midway through the posts there. For someone demanding these Swedish folk stop speaking in rare tongues and communicate in in english, you might do well to be to actually use your mother tongue correctly, and use correct grammar instead of that tiring Net-ese. Ironic really given we're all pirating from a German site. Ignorance parading as virtue is a most unattractive look."

,JonasM-,2010-02-23T13:56Z,"When i try to change the save folder, there comes a ""unable to find a file, please reboot"". What should i do?"
,Wsmack,2010-06-14T19:25Z,"Loading is the problem with compatibility because it wasn't made for win XP. To fix this, modify the compatibility mode for every .exe that you use to run the game(it should be about 3-4 at all) in compatibility mode for Win 95. Now, when you save and exit the game, go to the saving folder and replace _ with   (space) everywhere. That should fix it."
,eriks14042,2010-10-05T16:08Z,"I hope this is in english,rather than the last one i dlled was in russian"
,eriks14042,2010-10-05T16:14Z,"Okay i've downloaded it,that was friggin quick,how can everyone blame the DL speed?
