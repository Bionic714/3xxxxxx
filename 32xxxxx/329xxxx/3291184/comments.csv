,facett1,2005-02-18T19:01Z,"Nice, since noone else is adding these old WSOPÂ´s. If you or anybody else  have WSOP 1980, 1981 or 1997 (the years Stu  Ungar won),, please add them!!"
,robban2,2005-02-20T15:51Z,"I know the 1981 years wsop is out there somewhere.
It would be nice if someone could add these.
And as stated above, upload the wsops where Stuey wins, the best cardplayer of all time!"
