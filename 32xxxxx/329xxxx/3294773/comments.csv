,Raudung,2005-02-25T17:23Z,"Yeah, because driving on pot is the very definition of safety.. Your reaction times aren't reduced at all."
,StonerMan,2005-02-26T16:54Z,"Sure, you should NOT be driving under the influence o anything.
Same as you should not drive after a couple of drinks,
you should not be driving after a couple of bong or whatever.

but it should be legalized, i, for one would sacrifice alcohol in a jiffy for legalization..
a trade, alcohol for cannabis."
,hi-tech,2005-02-27T04:34Z,"Ofcourse you should never drive under influence of any drug. But studies show that people who are high are much better drivers than people who are drunk. Even if you are drunk, your driving skills will 'improve' if you smoke weed!
Sounds absurd, I know.... but it's still a fact!"
