,greymoonrising,2011-03-15T19:52Z,"The track ""One"" has Stipes and vocals but has Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen on base and drums.

Like many tracks on these so called ""Bono Solo"" albums they sometimes are tracks by either Bono, U2 or remixes.

This first album has to be the best in terms of sound quality though!"
