But when I say ""bomb"", I just meant that most (not all) people that I know that saw the movie either were extremely disappointed or they hated it because it wasn't really a movie about Pearl Harbor so much as it was a love triangle between Hartnett, Affleck and Beckinsale. I apologize to anyone that loved it. I just remember the hype over this movie, and then the disappointment that followed.

As far as official release, this clearly isn't. I used a few tools for my do-it-yourself editing (DVD Shrink to create a 1 disc ISO image of the 2 disc original; Daemon Tools to mount the ISO; MPEG Video Wizard to perform all the editing to create a new MPG file; TMPGEnc DVD Author to create the DVD files from the MPG; Auto Gordian Knot 1.93 to create the 2 AVI files!)

Hope you re-enjoy this one!"

When you watch movies, try to grasp the directors vision. I think you'll be pleased by the results."
