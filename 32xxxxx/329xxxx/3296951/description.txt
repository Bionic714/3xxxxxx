Finally the long awaited 'redux' version of this disappointing movie is here. If you hated the theatrical release because of the long, boring and foolish romance storyline between Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale, then this is the edition for you. 

Completely re-edited to cut out the lovestory plotline, this redux now takes on a completely different tone and meaning. No longer do you even know that Hartnett and Beckinsale have a love affair. As far as the viewer ever knows, Beckinsale is and only has been with Ben Affleck; this allows the movie to focus almost purely on what the public expected and wanted from this movie: the attack of Pearl Harbor. 

Comments and feedback about what you think of the 'redux' idea or what you thought of the edited movie are greatly appreciated!
