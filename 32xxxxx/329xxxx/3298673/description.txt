"Oz for Africa" benefit concert from the Sydney Entertainment Centre July 12 1985 to support the legendary "Live Aid"

This copy broadcast by MTV America during the 12/13 July 1985 night

Note the concert has been edited to the best moments. Not a continuous broadcast but almost four hours of footage anyway!

Commercials have been edited out of this DiVx rip

"Sidney" is MTV America's mistake.  Of course we all know that it is spelt "Sydney"

Given it's age it is far from perfect and grainy - but watchable - and one of the very few copies in existence apart from the master tapes which apparently MTV Australia/Channel 9 do own and are in storage but because of the logistics of getting permission from all bands and the cost involved I doubt we will see it released.  Maybe this bootleg might help.... maybe not.

This rip is from NTSC VHS source.  Captured and converted to DiVx format for smaller files for downloading.  Some cleanup applied but not very successful.  As mentioned it is still watchable and all we have of this historic concert at this point in time.  If you have access to better than this then please seed it!
