I want to create a tag i.e ""surrealtorrents""  ""hardtofindmovies"" or something!
Everyone who has such movies can put this tag to the torrent to make it easier to search those movies on PB!
How do I create a tag like this? IÂ´m no einstein on computers, you know;)"

,JuanMendoza,2008-06-19T02:34Z,"Hi, I'm a native spanish language speaker and a professional TV scripts translator. Chilean, as well as A. Jodorowsky. I must inform you that subtitles are not correct. Sometimes they  completely change the meaning of the dialogue. - If someone knows how to typeset titles and can do the job of re-embedding them onto the original film I would be happy to do the proper translation. - Besides that, does someone knows if the dead animals are really corpses or stunts? - Although the story is absolutely great it would be a pity that such a wonderful genius is shadowed  by killing such amount of animals instead of using proper stunt techniques."
,aaronWHAT,2008-06-22T05:12Z,"anyone know where i can find a translation of the spanish?
