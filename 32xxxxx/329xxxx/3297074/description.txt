El Topo (1970) has to be one of the most strangest films in history. A mysterious gunfighter dressed in black accompanied by his young naked son cross the desert on a holy mission of vengence and redemption.
It's a pretty twisted film that's highly enjoyable.
Too many crazy visuals for a sane person to handle. Many of the film's scenes will be burned into you brain long after you seen it. It´s like a bad LSD trip.
I highly recommend this movie, It's one you'll never forgot. A true experince in film-making.
A film Only for the opendmined, it´s not for everyone!
