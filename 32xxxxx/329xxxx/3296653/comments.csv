,jimschezlick,2008-02-16T17:18Z,"OK, I have explained this before with other torrents, this is another example;
Ready?
This torrent's size is INCORRECT. But, it works. When you get to 84.5%, YOU ARE DONE. Just rename it (if you have to, BITCOMET creates its own Extension until downloads are completed) to *.ISO and burn it. SO often when a download stops at a point close to being finished, and no one is sharing 100%, that means the size is being reported wrong somewhere, ion fact this down was 4.26 Gig as it is supposed to be. I use this trick all the time when I see other people asking for someone to finish sharing it out. You can always try this, and if it doesn't work, just name it back (if you have to) and resume downloading. "
