This is the version that has been floating around P2P-networks for some years, it is apparently a rip of a Tom and Jerry DVD set that was published in Japan. It contains almost all Hanna/Barbera and Chuck Jones episodes. Unfortunately, some of the Hanna/Barbera cartoons have been censored and/or redubbed. These episodes, along with the episodes missing from this set, will be uploaded as two VCDs after upload of the set is completed. 
Episodes marked with uncensored/original voices, are original episodes, for which there exist cut/redubbed versions.
