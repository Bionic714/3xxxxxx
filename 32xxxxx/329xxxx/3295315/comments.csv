Thank you!"
,waribou,2009-06-15T08:35Z,"Aww it was good but I think it had so much more potential in terms of action. The subtlety is wat the director probably wanted as the underlying tone of the whole thing with the soft ost and the matches with no music at all sometimes.. but adding some hollywood zoom and kabooms wouldnt have been bad. and also the director didnt have to make it obvious ""it doesnt matter who wins in the end"" by not showing the whole match at the end.. that was a let downer. but all in all I liked the manga-like script and the nice cgi work."
,crzlroy,2012-07-08T09:52Z,"there's a glitch around 5:40 into th cd2 file that caused th film to stop in my dvd player, but which i could skip over in vlc. don't think it's just my download, but it could be. just a caveat. excellent film, and an otherwise excellent upload. thanks!"
