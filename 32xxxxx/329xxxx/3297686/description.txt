The latest and third release from Born Naked.  This disc was produced by Tim Alexander (Primus) and engineered by Ralph Patlan at Prairie Sun Recording Studio (Cotati, CA).

There were enough guitar overdubs to warrant adding another guitarist for live performances, to match the CD sound. Tim decided to showcase his guitar skills by joining his longtime friends as band mate.

This CD was released in 2000 and is now out of print.

Enjoy!
