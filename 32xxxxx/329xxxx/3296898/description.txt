The Most under-rated band of all time just listen to this. Forget all comparisons with the Beatles its not what Pete Ham or Tom Evans would of wanted and this album shows that. Produced by Todd Rundgren it has some classic songs. This Album also has the 6 origanally produced tracks by Geoff Emerick and George Harrison. Please Enjoy and if anyone else has any other Badfinger albums please seed them!!!!!!!
