Combat Missions features some of the best soldiers and SWAT operators in the US competing together towards a price consisting of no less than $250,000.

The tagline is "Loose the mission, Loose a Man" and in every episode (15 i all), the loosing team must discharge a member.

*please* don't look at the official webpage, since they have a nice big picture of 
the winner, so there is a great deal of spoling the fun :-(
