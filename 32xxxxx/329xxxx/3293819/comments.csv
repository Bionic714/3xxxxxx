The .bc! extension is made by your bitcomet client.
Maybe its not finished yet.. or some thing went wrong when Bitcomet was finishing the download, try to rename the file by removing the .bc! (the filename is BUBBA_HO-TEP.iso)"
,Mojo4520,2005-02-27T13:34Z,"You can try to make a small ntfs partition then transfer your Bubba file to that partition, open BitComet and try reloading the fil at the new partition, then maybe you dont have to re-download everything again.... or better install another harddrive and partition the drive with ntfs filesystem, and copy your bubba file to that drive, and then start BitComet open the torrent and point the data to your new ntfs partition"

,emtec3000,2005-05-31T10:11Z,"yeah, you should make an NTFS partition for these big files. I got a 15gig NTFS partition dedicated to managing those 1 file dvd downloads. And unless you are running Linux, NTFS is the only filesystem for windows that handles files over 4gs."

,bignowhere,2009-07-25T08:10Z,"Hey, don't know if anyone else is having a prob when cutting to a disc, but film keeps staggering every 10 mins. or so. All the spec. feature and extras play excellent, but the movie its self....jump, jump, jump, pause, jump, pause.....play....jump, jump, jump, pause, jump, pause.....play....jump, jump, jump, pause, jump, pause.....play

Anyone else get this problem?  I'm cutting with Roxio 9 and have tried with both the computer and an external to cut it and find the same problem occurs with both cuts.  What A Stinker!"
