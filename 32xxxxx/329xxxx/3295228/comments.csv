,caerbannogh,2005-02-26T09:15Z,I agree. Nothing that soothes a tired mind more than Chomsky's pleasant voice. Great sleeping pill apart from the the intellectual and educational value!

You shoulda ended it there when you still were correct."

Not that I am anti-semite or like that ... but  just making things flat ... clear as they should be.

A sleeping pill can not be a moivator !

With abu Ghraib and the picture of the tortured Jesus in my mind ... I wonder what an intellectual sleeping pill better than the Lefty and the Antiwar ""right right"" Judases could be !

It is sick ... and the whole world is a witness deaf and blind to a lie and a pack of lies

Decaying Empire of lies and disgusting materialism ... fall !

Oops ... did I just spit at the materialist Pyramid  ...  

Tfoo... Masons !
