..................................TAKEN FROM BACK OF DVD BOX........................................
Ryan Dunn (played by himself) is one sorry SOB; He´s completely hung up
on Glauren (Jenn Rivell), His ex-girlfriend, even though she´s out playing the field.
Rumor has it she´s hooked up with heavy metals poster child, aptly named
Hellboy (Rake Yohn).
Ryan can´t stand the thought of the two of them together, so he recruits his friends
Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) to find out the truth.
The pair do whatever it takes to get their evidence, even breake into her
house. In the meantime Ryan flirts with insanity, has ru´-ins with the law,
And even gets stabbed in the eye with a fork as his friends try relentlessly
to help him forget the girl.
Haggard also features Special Appearences by Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek and Jason Ellis.
