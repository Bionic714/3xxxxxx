,nekholm,2005-02-27T19:04Z,"why no subs (don't bitching, just asking)?"
,StonerMan,2005-02-27T20:38Z,"Cause no subs exist.
This is a USA Import dvd
I guess bam doesn´t care about people who don´t understand english."
,StonerMan,2005-02-27T20:40Z,"Svensk text eller text alls, Existerar inte.
Usa import"
,dillback,2005-02-28T04:43Z,"is this NTSC or PAL? (and what are your other CKY ones also?)

thank you"
,StonerMan,2005-02-28T09:41Z,"Doesn´t say. But they are all USA Imports to Sweden
So i guess they´re NTSC.
Tell me how to check, and  i will."
,hnn,2005-02-28T10:01Z,"How to check if it is NTSC? Count the f**cking frames ;)


Start counting ;)"
,dillback,2005-02-28T11:18Z,shouldnt they say on the back covers? in the small print i think
,StonerMan,2005-02-28T14:41Z,"You know-it-all little bitch.
I´m not counting shit,
Download and count whatever the fuck you want."
,dillback,2005-02-28T21:43Z,"i guess if you ordered them from the U.S., and they are untouched, they probably are NTSC. "
,In0,2005-03-01T23:02Z,"jepp, personligen tycker jag Haggard inte ska ha text.. för att översättningen blir inte den samma som orden som sägs.. blir liksom lite fel och kanske lite tråkigare med text.."
,StonerMan,2005-03-02T14:02Z,"Och eftersom att den inte GÅR att köpa med svensk text,
Så är det en onödig diskussion."
,MoneyMan,2005-03-05T19:57Z,"ser att det e lite seedare hjälper till lite..
tack än en gång StonerMan
