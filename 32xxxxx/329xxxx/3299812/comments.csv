,makadam,2005-03-09T12:36Z,Om man har programmet sedan tidigare så går det inte bara att ersätta de äldre med de nya kartorna?

,SS_IMI_IEI_CG,2005-06-30T05:42Z,So has anyone been able to load this database and found a way around the licensing mess? I believe it will take a keygen.

,angusmcb,2008-06-19T02:16Z,"jcoll123 being his usual witty self, I see ;-)

Well I'm sure you're latest encryption is fairly the dog's bollocks mathematically speaking, but of course every implementation has it's flaws, and c-map's implementations are no exception to this rule. Your programmers need to get laid, go out sailing and reflect on life, or maybe just read Bruce Schneider again from the very beginning :-)

If you want, I'd be delighted to hop over to Stavanger or to Italy at my own expense and give 2 small lectures - the first on what cryptography actually is and what it is not, and the second on the dubious ethics of selling people back data they have already paid for with their taxes - and forcing them to take it in proprietary closed formats which also subject them to vendor lock-in and expose them danger on the high seas merely because they refuse to pay multiple times for the same HGO data.

;-)"

I would have been happy to buy a C-Map cartridge if I could use a regular USB card reader, but no, C-Map have to have their own reader !.

,tsgreg,2009-02-27T23:47Z,"dear profish..

i would very much appreciated if you could download the maxsea and the cmap (instructions included) i am seafarer and my company told me that cmap requested 5000 euro for installing the program for each vessel and 5000 euro annually to keep the charts updated. It is a very good program for me to draw ocean routes very fast and then compare with the charts. Those cmap charts can be updated somehow? can i plug the A.I.S. (Automatic Identification System) to the program? Thank you very much for your help"
