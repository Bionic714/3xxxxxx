I would like to be able to play it on my G4 800 with Radeon 9000 &4MB, but that may not be possible :-P"
,Ssargon,2005-03-01T16:40Z,"""Demon väger in på 56 MB och kräver inte speciellt mycket dator, en G3:a på 350 MHz och ett grafikkort med 8 MB VRAM är satt som lägsta krav även fast man rekommenderar en G4:a på 500 MHz."" /Macfeber

SÅ det ska nog fungera på min dator, ganska bra också :-)"
