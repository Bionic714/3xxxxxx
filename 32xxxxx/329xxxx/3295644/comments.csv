,OrpheusDude,2010-05-27T01:48Z,"Just a note to the last poster: this is FAR from the complete works of Tchaikovsky.  Glaringly absent are any any of his operas, which are among his greatest works (""Eugene Onegin,"" ""Pique Dame,"" ""Iolanta,"" ""Mazeppa, "" etc.).  Just have a quick look at Wikipedia at the extent of his output."
