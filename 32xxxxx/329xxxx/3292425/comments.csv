,anvan,2005-02-20T02:20Z,"Also, note that there still isn't a seed for this."
,madruga,2005-02-21T00:47Z,Thanks a lot for this.
,l0rgy,2005-02-21T15:20Z,"Worst rip ever. The main reason for it being so large is that it has twice the width and height of a ""normal"" release. 

That plus that the video encoding is utterly utterly fucked up.

I can't really recommend that anyone downloads this, which is sad concidering that Bill Maher is a really funny guy."
,veo1,2005-02-22T06:43Z,what kind of audio codec is this thing using?  I thought i had them all.....anyone know?
,l0rgy,2005-02-22T14:43Z,"The video was some fucked up version of XVID, don't remember what the audio was."
,k11u,2005-07-13T01:42Z,"maybe defrag or just format your harddrive, encode using virtualdub with XviD codec mp3 or ac3 for better sound and make them 350MiB so one can   fit 2 Eps on a CD....ffs :)"
