While physical conditioning can strengthen muscles, bones, and tendons, the tremendous forces exerted on the skeletal joints (fetlock, knee, stifle and hock) during everyday riding, training and competition may cause wear and tear to the joint cartilage, eventually compromising optimal joint function and affecting the mobility and performance of the equine athlete. Joint function and health can be supported in your horse with the administration of Cosequin, the number one veterinarian-recommended joint health supplement brand.

Diabetes Mellitus in Cats and Dogs

Diabetes mellitus is a complex disorder resulting from inability of the pancreatic islets to secrete insulin and/or from impaired insulin action in tissues. These abnormalities ultimately cause increased blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia), increased glucose in urine, increased drinking, urination and eating, and weight loss. Diabetes is one of the most common endocrine problems in cats and dogs, and can be fatal if incorrectly diagnosed or inappropriately treated."
