Mystica is a versatile art generator capable of creating custom images and movies for a 

variety of projects. In addition to basic 2D designs, Mystica features a built-in 3D engine. 

You can render images and movies at any size, export them in all major graphics and video 

formats, and let Mystica generate a HTML gallery for you.

3D images are uniquely interactive, and may be explored in real-time by means of helicopter, 

car, virtual camera, or just by walking. The 3D Viewer allows to take screenshots from all 

perpectives. The movie generator interpolates between given images. Movies can be exported 

in all major video formats (divx, mpeg etc). Rendering is done fully automated in 

background. Rendered assets can then be explored in 3D or furtheron edited, e.g. by applying 

various effects (filters, 3D lighting, layering, coloring etc). Both the effect and 3D 

section are also available for images of other sources.
