,scottchicken,2005-03-02T23:36Z,"This ain't funny, I wasn't around when it finished downloading so I un-wittingly helped to seed this for ages.   

This is garbarge, DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT IS NOT NINE INCH NAILS!"
,Captain_Nick,2005-03-03T05:01Z,"hahah! I just gathered all of the biggest NIN fans so we could hear it together, and then that crap came on. Very funny, anyone not amused has something up their rectum that urgently demands medical attention (that is to say, life is far too important to take so seriously)."
,stevedave,2005-03-04T03:00Z,delete this file and stop hosting the torrent. this is bogus. not at all nine inch nails.
,Scapegrace,2005-03-05T05:42Z,"thanks for the warning, I don't know why idiots bother doing frivilous things like this."
,godofdun,2005-03-05T18:11Z,Who is it just out of curiousity it its not NIN?
,insan3,2005-03-05T22:35Z,"Another NIN fake, huh - nice try llike everywhere... shame on all the dudes like this who uploaded the torrent file."
,smitty,2005-03-09T00:17Z,"Kill this bogus torrent you fucktard. 

This bullshit file sounds like the chipmunks on lsd.
Do us all a favor and stay off your daddy's computer from now on..."
,shary,2005-03-11T14:55Z,"fan vad ledsen jag blir.. jävla cp, kan inte lägga ut fakes på bittorrent för fan!"
,negativeions,2005-03-20T10:28Z,Why doesn't someone just e-mail the administrator and ask him to ban the IP of the tracker of this shit... Whenever you find fakes anytime just msg the admin and ask to ban... Why haven't I already e-mailed him?... I'm lazy.... hopefully you won't be though! 8-p
,ass_kicker,2005-03-25T05:51Z,hey LemonDick...  FUCK YOU!!!
