 Yup, it's time again for yet another wicked game music      
 release. This time around we give you an adrenaline pumping 
 release with the music from Unreal Tournament. Of course the
 same team of producers is behind this one as well and the   
 names are as usual Alexander Brandon and Michiel van den    
 Bos. For this score there are four people who've got credits
 for the music though, Peter Hajba and Andrew Sega is the    
 other two musicians. The main brains being of course Brandon
 and van den Bos. Lots of great tunes in this game, I have to
 say that this is one of my favorite game scores. Just take a
 listen to Skyward Fire and ofcourse the "amen beat" pumping 
 Foregone Destruction, I mean these tunes are just great.    

 I guess you all know by now how the ripping was done, but   
 let me just say (as I always do) that there's nothing       
 changed in the tunes or track names. They're just presented 
 plain and simple as they are stored on the game CD. I hope  
 you enjoy the tunes as much as I do.
