"Transmetropolitan is the brain-bendingly cool comic by Warren Ellis (the non-humble writer) and Darick Robertson (can't tell about the artist's ego, since he never gets to write letter columns). DC Comics has been wise enough to publish it, under the Helix imprint. It is, on the surface, an amusing, obscene story about a guy who's a lot like Hunter S. Thompson. He lives in some science fictional city and writes a newspaper column. He has a cat. It's very funny and you will laugh often while reading it.

But that's what's on the top. Fuck the obvious. What we really have here is a stingingly potent social satire. It's Ellis and Robertson writing and drawing everything they hate and love about the City, every city, all cities. It's a protagonist who partakes of the bile and anger and righteousness of every moral journalist since H. L. Mencken. It's got a stiletto hidden during the entire pratfall, and if you get too close you'll find out it stings.

Read the comic, if you aren't already. Get on with it."
