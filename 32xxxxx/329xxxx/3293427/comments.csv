,giggedyguy,2008-08-20T12:02Z,"You pick the best stories. Thanks. I'm filling my hard drive and I hate deleting great movies, but alas I must."
,giggedyguy,2008-08-21T13:14Z,"Egad, Eng subtitle for CD 2 doesn't work in Gom player. Vlc displays them so poorly in the worse typeface it's not even worth watching the movie. Gom worked great for CD 1. :("
,giggedyguy,2008-08-26T08:26Z,"I meant, it's not worth watching on VLC because GOM looks so much better, not that the movie isn't worth watching. It's a little slow, but it fills you with dread as everything seems so real and can really happen theoretically."
