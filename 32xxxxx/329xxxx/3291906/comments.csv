Thanks!"
,Novelty_Dies,2007-10-19T22:05Z,Thanks for sharing! Great stuff if you're a JD fan.

,dougaldog2002,2008-04-05T13:45Z,"I agree, I bought the VHS years ago and watched it once and never again since. Although the set list is OK, the quality of the video and audio is truly awful especially for an official release. Apparently Tony Wilson had just got himself a home video cam a few days before and couldn't resist trying it out at the gig!"
,dougaldog2002,2008-04-05T13:47Z,"Sorry, I forgot to say, don't blame the U/Per, this is probably as good as this video gets. It's worth the download for fans simply for nostalgia.

Thanks, bhu73!"
