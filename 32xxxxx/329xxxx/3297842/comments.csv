,paddesan,2005-03-04T06:37Z,Is this the BRUTUS RiP? If so...why rename it and change the size of the thing?
,M0vieMan,2005-03-04T09:32Z,"I'm sharing it in the exact same format I got it.
I don't know who encoded it in the Vodei format, but I do know that it works for me and all those who install the appropriate codec.

I'm seeding this one at 7000 kb/s, so one thing is for sure, this will download faster."
,rummelirutan,2005-03-04T17:05Z,"Tanka inte hem det här skräpet utan ta den riktiga rippen istället.

Don't download this junk.."
,RAWER,2005-03-05T00:23Z,JUNK SOUND!
,patrickpsych,2005-03-06T19:16Z,"The sound is corrupt.
Music and background sounds are good and crisp-clear, but you cannot understand anything they are saying.
Could just be a (strange) codec problem on my machine, but I think it is due to the DVDrip."
,M0vieMan,2005-03-06T22:39Z,Make sure you get the AC3 codec for proper sound playback.
,M0vieMan,2005-03-07T03:54Z,"If you are having trouble with the sound, get this:

http://ac3filter.sourceforge.net/"
,muhmut,2005-03-07T17:15Z,"Vodei codek?
did you elevator run in highest floors?"
,kaz-opu,2005-03-09T22:06Z,"I have installed ""Vodei"", ""ffdshow"" and ""AC3 filter"", but the sound doesen't work. What is wrong?"
,kabardey,2005-04-07T17:50Z,hey folks pleeeeaaase help !!! i have the movie downloaded but cant figure out anything with the vodei codec?? its link does not work!!! where do i find the needed codecs???
,M0vieMan,2005-04-10T08:10Z,"kabardey, the link works, just download Vodei MP from http://www.vodei.com"
,Reimblad,2005-04-19T23:51Z,"I have download it. But I don´t understand. 
How do I plaay the movie ? In winamp ? "
,somenboll,2006-01-13T05:20Z,"The vodei Codec Required is NOT for free! It is not a freeware and if you dont like paying 25$ then you will have an anoying popup comming up every 5 miutes when you watch the movie...just so you know... =)

Why use it?"
,Erazor_,2006-03-08T03:40Z,"Screw this one, you can't even view the entire movie without having to pay for the codec, and there's this annoying pop-up every ten minutes or whatever.

Whoever made this should be shot. That's just annoying."
,Erazor_,2006-03-08T04:09Z,"And don't even consider installing this Vodei crap, it will screw up your codecs - I had to re-install the entire range and using the installer to remove the ""broken"" Vodei codec which was still present after I uninstalled it.

My advice is: Stay clear of this!"
,Daphoes,2006-03-24T03:58Z,"You guyes should really check this forum out, heh it seem like vodei is nothing but a scam. judge for your self.

,coxxen,2007-04-10T01:20Z,dont download this junk
,malar,2007-05-27T14:25Z,"Do NOT download this. I know, seeding at the moment.  Why?
- It does not play on VLC (should be reason enough)
- You need ffdshow
- You need the Vodei codec.
- Vodei whines about registration every five minutes.
- Runs only on windows.

The one who compressed this with a substandard commercial codec should be dragged into an alley and shot."
,Markstern,2007-05-28T13:39Z,"DEATH TO VODEI AND IT'S CREATORS!

Keep information FREE, don't use Vodei!!!"
,Metusela,2007-06-02T16:26Z,"WARNING!!! Runs with VODEI, some sort of codec which you need to register for $25. Does NOT work i VLC at all. You'll have to go back to WMP. Trial version of Vodei works for aprox 30 min before reminders to register pop up every 3 min.

Vodei is just a seaky wey to get you to pay for something you realy can get for free. It's basically a mod of XviD.

,realqumran,2007-06-14T22:46Z,"Vodei is not a codec. It only puts some data in front of an existing file. It requires Vodei to get access to the original file, which then will be played using one of the codecs who is already included in the K-Lite (Mega) Codec Pack. I don't think you will find normal movie files with Vodei, probably only some vague files and it also wouldn't suprise me if Vodei (in the future) would include adware and/or spyware in their software.

,pimbles,2007-06-24T07:05Z,"For the love of god don't download this, you need Vodei to play it which will be annoying as shit and only work in WMP, and then will try to make you pay. Once you uninstall it it FUCKS UP ALL YOUR OTHER CODECS AND CORRUPTS QUARTZ.DLL

""M0vieMan"" needs to be fucking shot in the face for uploading shit with malicious goddamn software in it. Fucking piece of shit"
