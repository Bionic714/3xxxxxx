OK thanks to powow who sent up his copy of the Joe Strummer Rockpalast show i can now give you the tracks which were missing from my first post. The Joe Strummer Rockpalast 1999 secon part contains full versions of Brand New Cadillac, I Fought The Law, Tommy Gun, Bankrobber and an Interview. You can use TMPGEnc to cut the incomplete version of Brand New Cadillac from my first post and join them together and put the full show on DVD if you want. To fill up the space on the CD i have included the special that was broadcast by the Punk Rock Show a canadian show which has been getting shown on the Extreme channel here in the UK. Its a really nice heartfelt tribute to a truly inspiring man who's down to earth generosity and passion inspired more people to form bands than any other human being, enjoy!

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
