Release Notes:

#bonethugs does it again!  Krayzie Bone is back with the drama surrounded "Gemini: Good Vs Evil"
album on Ball'r records.  The first single, the Lil Jon produced Getchu Twisted was released
in June 2004 with the album expected to drop in September 2004.  After months of delays
and drama between the artist and the label, here it is.  Some hardcore Bone Thugs fans
may recognize certain songs from leaks several years ago. If you like it, BUY IT BONE NERDS!
