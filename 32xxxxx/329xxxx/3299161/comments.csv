,Thorsi,2007-01-18T17:28Z,"Har lastet ned, installert og testet, funker bedre enn å spille Windowsversjonen i Cedega. :-) Deilig å se at noen spill faktisk blir gitt ut også til Linux etterhvert. Tusen takk, torvalds, denne skal jeg seede mye på i tida framover.

I've downloaded, installed and tested, it runs perfectly. :-) One of the best games ever made! I will seed this for some time."
,ja bo niby kto,2007-01-25T16:52Z,Working perfectly. I would seed for some time.

,Volatile,2007-08-27T15:00Z,"Patchen verkar inte funka på nyare system, då den är beroende av en arkaisk tarväxel som inte stödjs längre... Finns det någon möjlighet att nån kan lägga upp spelet patchat och klart?"
,gaisboy,2008-03-02T15:57Z,"förlåt, men som ny linux (ubuntu) har jag noll koll på hur man installerar homm3 haft den i win i 7 år, och älskar spelet. Hur installerar jag den? Gärna i från scrats å på ""bäbis språk"""
,mdkaneda55,2008-03-27T20:46Z,"got this installed in Ubuntu Gutsy, here's the breakdown of what i had to do...

sudo apt-get install ksh
sudo ksh setup.sh

after it's installed.. when trying the update, it fails, so do this:

cd heroes3-1.3.1a-unified-x86/bin/Linux/x86/
sudo rm loki_patch
wget http://icculus.org/~msphil/loki/x86/loki_patch
chmod +x loki_patch
cd ../../../
sudo sh update.sh

after that, it runs, but i had a problem with permissions for the conig files... so make sure you have write-access to your ~/.loki/ directory and all sub directories .. then it works flawlessly! =)"
,irgumburgum,2008-05-18T14:23Z,"Im trying to play the game in full screen mode, but it doesn't seem to work. Why?

I use the full screen argument: .../path_to_the_game/heroes3 -f
but running always in windowed mode. :(

Please help me :)"
