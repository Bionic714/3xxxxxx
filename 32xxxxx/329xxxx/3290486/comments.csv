,Tykari,2005-02-15T21:27Z,"Ok I found the way to play with mouse , but I still have few questions : how to see the highscore list after the game ? and where should I type the NUKEWAR V (for example) to change the graphics mode ? PLZ help"
,StonesTM,2005-02-17T14:34Z,"hey Guys, if you cant seem to get this game working, my best bet would be to go out and look for a amige emul, UAE would be a good Choice, and download Nuclearwar as Amiga Rom..

I never had problems with that..
