,Broder,2005-02-25T12:44Z,"Toba: Det är knappast rätt ställe men jag har en request, har du en bra rip av den fenomenala filmen Failan. Jag har en tämligen sunkig Divx3 version som mest hackar sig igenom pga av dåligt synkat ljudspår.. Vore kalas att få den versionen utbytt.  Skulle älska dig för evigt om det gick att ordna."

,mrmonkeyboy,2005-02-26T10:20Z,"Jag testade din textning och det var snyggt av dig att få ut den så tidigt. Dock var det några översättningsfel i texten så jag korrigerade den något och la upp en ny version på nätet. Min version går att hämta på:

,Dover_Ben,2008-04-09T08:14Z,"How do you get the subtitles on the video?
please help. "
,jamesjohnjimbo,2008-04-18T18:17Z,"Dover_Ben: it´s simple. just rename your subtitles (srt or sub) same as your movie (avi, mpg,...), so you will get shutter.avi and shutter.srt and thats it! sometimes you need to install a codec pack like XP Codec Pack. just download, restart your pc and install. it will work ;-)"
,joet1980,2008-05-08T19:38Z,This movie does not play with English subtitles don't waste your time.  It plays with VLC but it has Asian subtitles and I cannot burn it with any subtitles.  Very unfriendly torrent.

,SEEDITFORME,2008-06-09T19:06Z,"Nice one, idiot. How can we watch a movie without any subtitles? Thank God there's a hollywood remake... Saves us the trouble of downloading torrents by a moron."
,redstormBT,2008-06-19T00:53Z,Does it have the Eng sub or no ?
,Ravenger58,2008-07-09T00:30Z,Freakin Nice and creepy movie.  Great quality. I had no problems with this movie if you play it correctly you get perfect english sub-titles .here 's what I did I used VLC player get it here http://www.videolan.org/vlc/  install and run open movie file and load the pme-shutter.srt file in the use subtitles section its right under the open movie file section in the VLC player. then play movie . oh yeah and make sure you unzip the pme-shutter.sub file in the same dir it should be in the included smaller archive. oh and dont load pme-shutter.sub file like i did the first time just make sure you load the pme-shutter.srt file for your sub titles section. and have fun . Great movie . nice ending ha.
,alfiefive,2008-07-13T22:16Z,"this is one of the scariest movies i've seen in a while, and i watch a lot.  lights off, volume up.  you will gasp and scream!  amazing."
,alfiefive,2008-07-13T22:16Z,"and yes, it has english subs."
,ono-ohyes,2009-02-09T21:44Z,"Ignore SEEDITFORME's comment and others that there are no English subtitles. There are! You can see them when you click download torrent, and if you use uttorrent or similar clients, you can plainly see the .sub file.

For those of you who do not know how to display/use the subtitles file, GET OFF YOUR LAZY A$$E$ AND GOOGLE SEARCH THE ANSWER... (it's actually very very easy - and annoying to see the same comments on practically every torrent here on tpb - and THAT'S WHY you don't get an answer to your question; all the commenters are tired of answering the same question again and again)."
,Michael80,2009-03-10T20:12Z,"Thank you very much, man! Extremely exciting, great movie. Nice plot. Worth of download and sharing. Not exactly for faint hearts. :)"
,CZ_BRNO,2009-03-15T23:00Z,I put pme-shutter.avi and pme-shutter.sub in the same directory and used both media player classic and vlc player and I sure as hell don't see no english subs. I only see one video track too.
,CZ_BRNO,2009-03-15T23:06Z,Never mind. Got it now. Ravenger58 is right.
,i_am_sid,2010-05-27T17:33Z,"was searching for this movie.By mistake downloaded the hollywood version of it and as oon as i know i stop watching that.
Well i'll tell about quality when i finish downloading it.
But for now thanks very much TOBA."
,i_am_sid,2010-05-28T05:39Z,"the quality is great.Thanks TOBA.
The rar file in it contains chinese(i think) subtitle and the idx file belongs to it. Just remove both these and your english subtitle(srt) will work by default. 
Havent seen the movie yet."
,est1987,2011-02-11T06:20Z,"Amazingly fast download, great film. The remake sucked. 10/10!"
