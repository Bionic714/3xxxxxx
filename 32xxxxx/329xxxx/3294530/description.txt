Did you know that you have a recording studio in your computer? 

You really do! If your Windows computer has a sound card or sound module 
(as almost all do), Cool Edit 2000 can turn it into a recording studio with 
all of the features used by professional audio engineers. You can use it to 
record your own music, voice or other audio, edit it, mix it with other audio 
  or musical parts, add effects like Reverb, Chorus, and Echo to it, equalize 
  it, and master it so that you can burn it to a CD, post it on the 
  World Wide Web, or email it. Once you get started, you'll be amazed at what 
  you can achieve! 

  So what can you do with Cool Edit 2000? Once you've got something recorded or 
  loaded into it, you can cut, paste, and move audio around just as you do text 
  in a word processor. It slices! It dices! And if you make a mistake, the undo 
  feature will let you back up and try it again.

  Want to put your voice in Carnegie Hall? Give it that 60's flange? Boost 
  the bass? Cool Edit 2000 has more than twenty fantastic audio effects and 
  tools like Echo, Flange, Compression, Amplify, Noise Reduction, Reverb, 
  Time/Pitch stretch, and much more.

  Cool Edit 2000 also has powerful analysis tools. You can examine the frequency
  components and other details about your audio with the Frequency Analysis, 
  Statistics, and Spectral View features. 

  When you're all done, you can compress your audio MP3 or Real Media G2 to 
  post on the web or email it to your friends. If you'd rather burn it to CD, 
  Cool Edit 2000 can prepare the audio for that. If you've found yourself on 
  the leading edge, and need audio for DVD, you'll appreciate Cool Edit 2000's 
  support for 24-bit/96kHz files.
