	When they were kids growing up together in a rough section of Boston, Jimmy Markum (SEAN PENN), Dave Boyle (TIM ROBBINS) and Sean Devine (KEVIN BACON) spent 
	their days playing stickball on the street, the way most boys did in their blue-collar neighborhood 
	of East Buckingham.
	Nothing much ever happened in their neighborhood. That is, until Dave was forced to take the ride that 
	would change all of their lives forever.
	Twenty-five years later, the three find themselves thrust back together by another life altering event 
	the murder of Jimmy’s 10-year-old daughter. Now a cop, Sean is assigned to the case and he and his 
	partner (LAURENCE FISHBURNE) are charged with unraveling the seemingly senseless crime. 
	They must also stay one step ahead of Jimmy, a man driven by an all consuming rage to find his 
	daughter’s killer.
	Connected to the crime by a series of circumstances, Dave is forced to confront the demons of his own 
	past. Demons that threaten to destroy his marriage and any hope he may have for a future. 
	As the investigation tightens around these three friends, an ominous story unfolds that revolves around 
	friendship, family and innocence lost too soon.</td>
