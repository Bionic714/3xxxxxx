,segmentation-fault,2006-02-09T04:36Z,"For God's sake, NuclearM2! If you want to share something, share it with a decent quality.

Your MP3's has a very poor quality. 128 kbps are horrible, 192 kbps are reasonable, 256 kbps are good, 320 kbps are excelent. If the music is encoded using other codec than MP3 (OGG, AAC) is even better, since the quality of MP3 is outdated."
