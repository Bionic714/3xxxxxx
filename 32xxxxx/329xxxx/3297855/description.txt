OK here's a great show by the band Pennywise way back in 1994. This is filmed right in front of the band so its as in your face as your likely to get. The sound is good and the picture is good, with nice steady filming. This is a must have for any Pennywise fans or anyone into fast hard punk rock, hope you enjoy it!

Pennywise-Goatshead Soup Houston Texas 27th February 1994 SVCD 45m Minutes

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
