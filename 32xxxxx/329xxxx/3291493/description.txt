     ? EA Sports presents the new standard in NASCAR PC racing: NASCAR 
     ? SimRacing. Created by NASCAR veterans and tested by NASCAR NEXTEL 
     ? Cup Series drivers like Ryan Newman, NASCAR SimRacing is the 
     ? perfect combination of realism, true racing 'feel', depth, and 
     ? advanced EA SPORTS presentation. Thunder down the straightaway at 
     ? Daytona International Speedway alongside 42 other live drivers 
     ? online as Voice Over IP smack talk mixes with the roar of V8 
     ? engines in glorious surround sound. Navigate the high banks of 
     ? Bristol Motor Speedway then watch full race replays and analyze 
     ? your telemetry against that of real drivers to improve your skills
     ? as you progress through Career mode. Live the life of a NASCAR 
     ? driver as you rise through the ranks to Chase for the Cup in the 
     ? most realistic NASCAR game ever created.

     ?  Race Tested, Driver Approved: The all-new racing engine in 
     ?   NASCAR SimRacing is crafted by NASCAR racing veterans from EA 
     ?   SPORTS and previous NASCAR sims, and then tested by top NASCAR 
     ?   drivers including Ryan Newman. So when you brake to enter a 
     ?   corner, you experience the same physics that real NASCAR drivers
     ?   experience--neither arbitrarily hard or easy, just real.
     ?
     ?  Career Mode with Three NASCAR Racing Series: NASCAR Craftsman 
     ?   Trucks, National Series, and NEXTEL Cup competition--work your 
     ?   way up from tough truck racing to the big show in Career mode.
     ?
     ?  Online Racing with 43 Live Drivers: Compete with up to 42 other 
     ?   drivers or fill in the field with AI drivers--the largest fields
     ?   in any racing game. Talk to your opponents with Voice Over IP 
     ?   (microphone and broadband Internet connection required), compete
     ?   in Hot Lap leagues and Tournaments, and compare your results in 
     ?   online rankings. You can even watch races as a spectator to 
     ?   check out the competition.
     ?
     ?  Thundering 3D Audio: Hear the sweet sound of 750+ horses roaring
     ?   by in Dolby Pro Logic II audio, so close you can almost smell 
     ?   the hot oil and burning rubber.
