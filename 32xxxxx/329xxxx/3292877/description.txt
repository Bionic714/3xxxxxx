Two albums of Dutch renaissance music of Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck played on two wonderful sounding instruments (3 CDs). Ripped with Exact Audio Copy and compressed with LAME (VBR).

1. "Keyboard Music" with Christopher Herrick at the organ of Norrfjärden Kyrka, Norrfjärden, Piteå (1997 reconstruction of the 1609-1684 organ in the German Church, Stockholm)

2. "Organ Works" with Jacques van Oortmerssen at the Organ of Grote of St. Janskerk, Schiedam

I'd love to hear either of these instruments live if I could figure out how to get out of Los Angeles!!
