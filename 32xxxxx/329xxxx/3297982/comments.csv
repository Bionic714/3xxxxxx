1. mount it with alcohol 120% or poweriso
2. install with serial key (first with CD1 and then with CD2)
3. after installation completes, mount CD1 again, explore this CD in My Computer and locate the folder named ""HOODLUM""
4. in this folder ""HOODLUM"", copy the mvp2005 icon (this is the crack file) and paste it in the main installation directory (C:\Program Files\EA SPORTS\MVP Baseball 2005)
[note: it is okay to overwrite the previously mvp2005 icon file]
5. double click on the newly pasted crack file in the directory and play

hope that helps"

,7up3345,2008-07-24T05:17Z,"why when i download the patches, they wont work?"
,Pixelated_Death,2008-08-01T17:12Z,"Make sure if you are going to use the original patches for this game you do so with the original .exe. If you copy the HOODLUM No CD Crack to the MVP directory and then try to patch it will give you the old file not found error.

Also for those who want to play in Owner Mode go to either GameBurnWorld or GameCopyWorld and download the MVP BaseBall 2005 Mini Image. Mount if in Daemon Tools, no emulation needed. I would suggest everyone use the Mini Image and NOT the HOODLUM crack as it crashes a lot."
