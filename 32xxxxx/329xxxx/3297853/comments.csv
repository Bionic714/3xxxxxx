,ambientlight,2009-12-30T20:34Z,I downloaded and installed this program. the site code is generated when you run the license program. then to run this under vista go into compatibility and run it as a Windows Xp SP2 :) ... works great ... cant connect to Word 2007 only word 2003 and earlier ...
,Sweuk,2011-09-13T08:36Z,"Thank you. It still works great.

To get the site code: after the install, go to Buy or Move License from the Start Menu and hit Enter.

Copy it to your KG and... Done."
