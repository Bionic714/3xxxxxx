,S.R,2008-09-15T20:57Z,"Aight, so, I get 3 internetthingies, 1 textdocument and 2 folders witch contains a ridiculus amount of compressed files. When I uncompress them I get 2 files out of each folder of files. Those files seem to be some sort of worthless junk that just takes up  space on the harddrive.

Could anyone tell me what to do with these files please!?"

,LachD,2010-01-24T07:38Z,"Please Seed only downloading at 20Kbs, 

@Stunna13 if you cant play because of a Cube 3D error in vista then replace the 3Dsetup.exe with the 3Dconfig.exe from Nascar Thunder 2004 (rename the 3Dconfig to 3Dsetup) Download the Demo of Nascar Thunder 2004 for the 3d config."
