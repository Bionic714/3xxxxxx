,Bedde,2005-02-21T16:36Z,wich program should i burn it with??
,MuSickFinder,2005-02-21T16:59Z,If you want to burn them as audio-cd I suggest you download mpc batch encoder from http://www.musepack.net/  and then decode files to .wav form
,Bedde,2005-02-21T18:18Z,"i have dbpower amp ,does it work with that to?"
,Bedde,2005-02-21T18:22Z,"No it didnt look as if it works with db power,iwill try your suggestion,many thanks to you....."
,Al_Bundy,2005-04-17T20:22Z,wtf is mpc??? is it possible to change it to a normal damn mp3 file
,MuSickFinder,2005-04-17T21:45Z,"mpc is more advanced audio codec than mp3, you must re-encode them to mp3 with a good ripping tool that fully supports both audio formats, or first decode to wav and then encode to mp3, this procedure costs you degraded sound quality"
,Al_Bundy,2005-04-18T18:39Z,"arrrgh,,ok thanx for the information"
,Moreless,2006-09-16T22:18Z,keep seeding ppl
,kotommy,2007-01-12T08:18Z,"I hope i can download and get this to work:-) I was at a consert in the late 90:s with Vixen, they play before Scorpions in Stockholm...."
,garand_g,2007-01-29T01:18Z,"txh MusicFinder for your Vixen albums
for those who downloads and cand play,
you can download a plugin for winamp and it works OK!"
,greylion,2007-03-18T22:30Z,"I hadn't even heard about musepack before I saw this torrent. Luckily xmms-musepack was easy to find and worked flawlessly - I was playing these songs only seconds after the download was complete. One more reason to use Linux(Debian).
Still, do we really need more semi-obscure audioformats to mess up our music-collections?
Before this, my collection had only mp3 and ogg, about half of each.
Anyway, thanks for the music - Vixen is right up there with my favourites!"
