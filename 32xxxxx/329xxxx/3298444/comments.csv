,mUnTe,2007-10-22T23:37Z,"HeHe  ;P i Have all the Books Standing at ease in my library  =D 
Ive gone thru them from book 1-21 at least 5 times.. Best damn work ever.
Damned shame the author croaked thwas the first a January 2000 a sad day. He had started on the twentyfirst book in the series which i got my hands on a while back only first chapter completed and the rest was notes and scribbles.
damn shame."
,Abrwnnya,2008-04-17T11:25Z,Extra seeding would be muchly appreciated- I've been looking for these for a while.
,MacDancer,2008-08-19T02:05Z,"Allow me to convey my utmost appreciation to both the original uploader and to all the seeders. I've spent the last hour stumbling around my house mumbling viciously in search of the seventeenth entry in this saga, and although it's not as nice to curl up with a laptop as with a paperback, I'm deeply indebted to all of you."
