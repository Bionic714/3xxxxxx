,Ratass,2005-02-26T19:50Z,"Beavis & Butthead äger ju som fan :D

Tummen upp för att du seedar :D"
,Najky,2005-02-27T16:04Z,I think there is something wrong with my BitComet... I can only upload in like 7kbps even though I have the highest priority on it... I hope it'll be better in a few hours when one of my DL's finished.
,shatan666,2005-02-27T20:23Z,Do these episodes include the music videos?
,Najky,2005-02-28T10:01Z,"No, the music videos are cut out. Just the ""fun"" is left :-).
I now have full upload on this shit :-D.
There is some extra material like games and songs in this pack too."

,tourettes,2006-01-06T17:44Z,"why the fuck would you cut out the music videos? they're the best thing about b & b. dude, it's all grunge man(well...some is at least) and you cut it out? ye damn fuckoff-wank."
,Najky,2006-01-06T17:56Z,"Lol? I downloaded this from some1 who had collected all the episodes he could find. I'm just distributing them forward. If you don't like it you don't have to download it. No point making a comment about it since you got a choise whether or not to download it. I too want the entire collection including everything, but since it's very hard to find I downloaded what I found, and this was it. Take it or leave it, it's just that simple. Your comment is kinda dumb. Wouldn't it be awkward if I complained on a guy for uploading a torrent of lets say... Destiny's Child (which I don't like) just cause he uploaded it? I mean... lol? People have different taste you know, but I guess you lay a comment on every torrent you dislike just because you don't like it."
,tourettes,2006-01-19T15:00Z,dude take it easy. just wanderin why yed cut out the videos. dont need te get yer panties in a twist...
,Najky,2006-01-24T23:06Z,"tourettes: then why did you had to add this sentence: ""ye damn fuckoff-wank.""? That's why i ""twisted my pants""."
,tourettes,2006-02-02T18:41Z,dunno...tourettes maybe?

,Bellund,2006-10-14T23:56Z,"Seems like there is a virus in this,, ""PE JEEFO.A in BBTENNIS.EXE Description:
