,AssMaster,2005-02-27T20:56Z,"hehe, emulated games (for console systems anyway) are often mentioned as ""roms"", big deal =)"
,Renaldo,2005-02-27T21:22Z,Not often; always. I assume the first poster is an idiot.
,worlduser,2005-02-27T23:19Z,"We need more leechers, only 250 to 1 seeder..."
,Zedrick,2005-02-28T07:15Z,"1) that doesn't make it right

2) nobody in the C64 emulation community calls them ""roms""

3) What do you call c64 roms then?"
,Ardinia,2005-04-20T05:23Z,Has anyone actually gotten this to work on their PS2?
,NiPz0,2006-01-13T23:38Z,vad e c64 ? e det n64 ?
,NecroBeator,2006-03-09T12:00Z,Nope...Commodore 64...
,Peak,2006-03-22T08:42Z,"Zedrik, are you seriously saying there are less than 10 roms available? I think Commodore released something like 300 cartridges for the C64. There must surely exist more, or where do you find the information about probably less than 10?"
,mr.bump,2006-09-10T19:35Z,how do you burn this for ps2?
,weasel5i2,2009-12-10T04:19Z,"Actually, C64 ROMS are things like the BASIC ROM (which resides between 0xA000 and 0xBFFF), CHAR ROM (which is switched in and out via a peek/poke of location 0xDC0D, and resides between 0xD000 and 0xDFFF), and KERNAL ROM (which resides between 0xE000 and 0xFFFF)

Nobody calls C64 software ""ROMS"" unless they're misinformed. I just call 'em software images or emulator images."
,weasel5i2,2009-12-10T04:21Z,"Oops, that CHAR ROM bank-switching interrupt is achieved by doing a POKE to 0x0001. My bad."
,daeda1us,2010-03-21T22:09Z,"And there we go ladies and gentlemen...

A prime example of an over the top turd!"
,Tripgnosis,2010-04-03T21:23Z,"call em sizzleflops for all the fuck I care, I'm downloading...."
,rems500,2010-10-18T10:09Z,"6000 roms. ""fun for hours""

,BlackWabi,2012-04-19T23:29Z,"Great, thanks."
