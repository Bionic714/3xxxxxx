,=HPSF=roadrunner,2007-01-29T21:35Z,"So, how do I load this on a new HDD?  I seem to have created the DVD alright; It reads and give options to load all OS's, but when I put it in new computer, and try boot from CD, I get nothing.  Do I need to create a new bootdisc for one individual OS?  Any tutorials on how I could do this, or is there an image file somewhere I am not seeing?  I am pretty new to this type of stuff, so any help would be appreciated.  "
