,Jigz,2005-07-31T01:23Z,"Subtitles can be found at the following link. There are two English subs listed, choose the second one ( 2 CD srt in zip file) as it fits the timing and duration of this rip. : http://subtitles.images.o2.cz/116557/Iz%F4%3A+Kaosu+mataha+fuj%F4ri+no+kijin.html"
,steffster,2005-08-10T10:59Z,Thanks for the subtitles!
,sharp_006,2006-06-18T07:44Z,"this is a very abstract movie, replete with imagery and philosophical musings.  some of the imagery is over the top, imho, but it should make a good watch for any film buffs.  casual action flick fans need not apply."
,muddy-mudskipper,2007-08-07T20:03Z,Is anyone aware of there being any subtitles including the lyrics for the singer?  As it's the only Miike film I've seen with a singer I get the feeling I missing some important aspect of what he's trying to get  across with the film.
,straumm,2008-11-14T01:58Z,"Thank you for all the movies, and for the subs.  They don't seem to be anywhere else..."
,sibrphreak,2008-11-27T04:15Z,f'ing brilliant.  Definitely among my favorite films by Miike!
,HappyHelvete,2009-01-27T13:24Z,Thanks a lot:)
