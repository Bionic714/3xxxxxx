I have not been able to find a good copy of this song anywhere, so I figured out how to rip the audio from the menu of the 'Rock Against Bush, Vol. 2' DVD. It is recorded at a low volume but it is very good quality. You just have to turn your speakers up or normalize it to the loudest track, if you plan to burn to a CD. Enjoy. :)
