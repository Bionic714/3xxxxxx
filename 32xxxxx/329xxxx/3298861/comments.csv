,backern,2005-03-06T18:16Z,Wrong category...
,ReZuth,2005-03-06T18:36Z,Actully hence its a DVDrip I think it fits here
,Johosc,2005-03-06T19:05Z,"Season 2-7 coming right up, with Angel S1-4 following... Spread the Buff!"
,Anderss08,2005-03-06T20:36Z,"First season is NOT on one dvd.
This is NOT a dvd-rip.
Should be under TV or film!!"
,Ahondara,2005-03-06T20:47Z,Great!!!! Upload the next seasons as fast as you can. My girlfriend is crazy about buffy and I dont mind watching it with her :)
,Ahondara,2005-03-06T20:53Z,Hmm... but please try to make the files 350 MB... coz it fits so nice on a cd then.. I hope u will coz my girlfriend dont have a dvd...
,cozmik2004,2005-03-06T21:34Z,Does all the files fit on one DVD?
,Johosc,2005-03-06T21:53Z,"Err... of course the entire season doesn't fit on one single DVD? Every file is frickin 400MB in size =) Excuse me if I'm being a little slow here and I'm misunderstanding you, but otherwise this is a rip from the Season One DVD box. It's not from TV what I know of (I'm not the ripper), also it lacks the typical lousy commercial cutaways. I think it's from DVD.

Ahondara: Sorry, I'm afraid I don't have the time to convert them into 350MB files. You go buy some 800MB CD:s instead! =)

Ahondara and Thrax: Season 2 just uploaded, rest of them coming..."
,hi-tech,2005-03-07T01:26Z,"yeah, wrong category...

ReZuth: it's NOT a dvd-r, it would be a little crowded here if all dvdrips were placed under dvd-r...."

,nicegirl,2005-03-18T12:01Z,"Hi, this is really cool, thanx a lot.

,JockeII,2005-03-24T04:33Z,"Man, you rock!
It felt really bad when the site that had all the Buffy and Angel-seasons shut down before I had the time to download all seasons! I only got season 1-4, and I think its exactly the same files so I will help upload when I can, only got 0,5mbit and Im playing a lot of WoW right now =(

Really waiting for Buffy seasons 5-7 and all the Angel seasons :D

You rock! :thumbsup:"

,alisson,2006-07-03T18:22Z,ursäkta men är det inte mer avsnitt än så här på första sesongen. För jag får det inte att stämma när jag börjar titta på andra sesongen och om det finns fler avsnitt kan du lägga upp en länk ä du snäll.....      tack på förhand

,Glitterspell,2008-07-04T15:00Z,Johosc you are a life saver if it hadn't been for you I'd have never been able to see anything on Buffy I love this season because of the Angel/Buffy romance thank you so much for all of your uploads!!!
,dmketach234,2008-07-13T08:57Z,does anyone have season 2 & 3 on dvdrip that they can seed? can't find them anywhere except the all seasons seeds.
,Lollipopbabe,2008-10-02T23:50Z,"stop moaning you bunch of pussys. go out and buy Buffy from the shop then... if you dont like it. Why come onto a site like this, where everything is FREE and complain about the file size/or caterogy the torrent is in. GROW UP! This is a FREE download, be fucking grateful."
,flecker,2008-11-21T01:52Z,this isnt a dvd-r. wrong categorie.
,takeasied,2009-04-14T18:20Z,some people are so stupid no its no dvd buy convertxtodvd and burn it and you got your dvd.
,heizfeld,2009-06-13T22:29Z,"Why write DVDRIP if it isn´t?
None of the original dvdrip-subs fits.
Obv hobby cutter or something.
