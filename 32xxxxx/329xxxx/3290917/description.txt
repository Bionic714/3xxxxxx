OK here's a show i filmed back in 1996 by the amazing 88 Fingers Louie sadly now no more. They are the first band i heard successfully combined hardcore and melodic punk and you can now see there influence everywhere. This is a great show and there's not a lot of 88 Fingers Louie shows out there, so get this and i guarantee you won't be disappointed, enjoy!

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install.         http://www.videolan.org/
