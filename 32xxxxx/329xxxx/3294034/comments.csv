Dawn of the Dead is coming out soon, also including an extras package. :)

Night of the Living Dead will also be out in time, in great quality with optional subtitles, as always."
,bugmenot1,2005-05-07T18:56Z,Seed please.
,Draze,2005-06-18T19:38Z,"Thanks for this one! Took a while to download, but it was worth it."
,Ran4,2005-07-20T17:16Z,"this works really great.

HOWEVER what idiot has encoded this? it's using Q-Pack (or what the name was). only an idiot would do that! it can't be played on ANY divX-player on the market, and you need an somewhat new computer to even play the file!

i'm on 1,7ghz and 512 mb RAM, and it's just over enough to be worth to see. what's that shit? a normal divX works SUPERB with 1ghz and 256 mb ram!
the sound is also really bad.

to sum it up: good movie, WORTHLESS codec!"
