Another quality release from bjjo! ;-) 

A classic zombie flick by director George A. Romero. Part two in his zombie trilogy (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead). Expect all of them to come up here in with the quality you've come to expect from bjjo. Also, a documentary on Day of the Dead is on it's way.

The movie is XviD in two parts with -optional- Swedish .srt subtitles.

Recommended software:

Mplayer Classic.
