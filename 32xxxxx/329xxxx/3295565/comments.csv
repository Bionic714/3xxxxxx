,MrWise.dev,2005-02-28T14:54Z,"Jag skulle gärna vilja ha Spacemonkeyz vs. Gorillaz låtarna, så sköna dub remixar :>"
,LondonLoves,2005-03-04T13:50Z,"Did you know that the singer in Gorillaz, Damon Albarn is also the singer in Blur. You know the band that made Song 2, also known as 'Wohoo song', and many more great songs. They've made 8 albums this far, including the album Best of. Now blur is recording a new album, but thats not all. Damon Albarn is recording a new album with Gorillaz as well. So all Blur- and Gorillaz Fans have something to look forward to!"
,hitthatlugh,2005-05-14T10:30Z,"did you know del tha funkee homosapien has been around for years? Del is Ice Cube's cousin and used to be with NWA. He has quite a few albums, most notably Both Sides of the Brain, which is a great album."
,vxl,2005-06-11T21:53Z,"This release would be perfect, if not for the last song M1A1. The track is totally fucked here and there during the first two minutes. I suggest you download that particular track from somewhere else."
,CommanderCool160,2006-11-02T14:50Z,On 99.86%....Please! Seed!

,nyiddle,2008-07-23T00:52Z,"This rip is missing two tracks (Dracula and Suzuki Method), plus the last track (M1A1) is messed up.

I'd recommend trying a different torrent..."
,xXjl23Xx,2008-10-19T22:56Z,"Dracula and Suzuki Method are bonus tracks, this is the original release."
,Wolfe9165,2009-01-29T16:14Z,"Alright, sweet deal. Seed it when I can."
,Hal440,2009-04-14T13:35Z,"nyiddle is correct. 2 tracks missing and M1A1 isn't right.

But thanks for uploading wozzaworld"

,Housezz,2010-07-13T18:08Z,Definitely something wrong with the last track M1 A1. I suggest moving along to other torrents.nnhttp://thepiratebay.org/search/gorillaz+2001

,weaselgo,2010-09-29T07:28Z,"Awesome! Thanks!
However the last 3 tracks seem to be missing:
16- Dracula
17- Left Hand Suzuki Method
18- Clint Eastwood (Ed Case & Sweetie Irie Refix)

:("
,weaselgo,2010-09-29T07:32Z,"to add to my previous comment:
Track 15, M1 A1, (yes it starts out weird, it's supposed to [I just skip that part]) Is only supposed to be about 4 mins long. For some reason the Clint Eastwood Remix is tacked on the end, with science in between."
,syadle,2011-12-02T11:13Z,Is it just me or is the last track f'd up?
,dyt2012,2012-06-20T10:23Z,"Bad rip, M1 A1 skips quite a bit."
