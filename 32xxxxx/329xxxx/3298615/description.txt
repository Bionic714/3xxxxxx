Beethoven's complete String Quartets performed by the Julliard Quartet, recorded between 1964 and 1970. This complete Julliard set is a bit unusual in that the Great Fugue (Op 133) is played between the Cavatina and Finale of Op 130.

Ripped with Exact Audio Copy and compressed with LAME (VBR).

Dedicated to Grofinet for discovering my omission of the finale in Op 130 of the Emerson Quartet set and for uploading the wonderful Gardiner recordings of the complete symphonies!
