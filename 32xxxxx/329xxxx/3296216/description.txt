MultiArcomage is a multiplayer version of the popular Arcomage subgame in the Might and Magic series. The original game only supports two players which just wasn't enough for us. So we did a fair amount of work (read: wrote a totally new game and ripped the graphics and sounds) and created a version that supports 2-4 players.
