Description: Television is ephemeral, so the greatest compliment any TV show can receive is to be remembered.
It's clear that a lot of people fondly remember a half hour comedy series that ran on the ABC network from 1986 to 1988 called "Sledge Hammer!"
The show chronicled the adventures of a gung ho police detective who shot first and asked questions six months later. (In fact, he forgot to yell "Freeze" before firing.)
Sledge Hammer and His GunHammer's best friend was his Magnum, and he habitually spoke to it. (Hey, people talk to their pets, right?)
Why so many people young and old remember "Sledge Hammer!" is a mystery.
Maybe it's because the show was an odd duck. Perhaps it's because current television is bland, with every situation comedy revolving around a living room and kids.
Orâ€¦ it could be because a lot of people are insane.
Whatever the case, "Sledge Hammer!" is frequently referred to as a "cult" show.
Tagline: Trust me, I know what I'm doing.
