As I saw, the old one i put out had gone and died (6 months alive wow) and still there was a few people after the movie, decided to put it out for a second time. Too bad i couldn't put out the original release (packed with winrar) but, this is the same disk anyway. Now in ISO format. 

Plot : The story revolves around a dying father and his son, who is trying to learn more about his dad by piecing together the stories he has gathered over the years. The son winds up re-creating his father's elusive life in a series of legends and myths inspired by the few facts he knows. Through these tales, the son begins to understand his father's great feats and his great failings.
