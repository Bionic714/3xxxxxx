JIMI HENDRIX
ELECTRIC LADY MIXING SESSIONS

Mixing & Overdubbing Sessions
Recorded at Electric Lady Studios, New-York
August 14th, 1970



1. NIGHT BIRD FLYING  (10'43)
2. DOLLY DAGGER  (4'56)
3. FREEDOM  (9'21)
4. DRIFTING  (41'29)

These recordings feature the overdub & mixing of tracks that would eventualy be included on Jimi's 2 LP project "First Rays of the New Rising Sun". These were allegedly recorded by an employee who connected a tape deck into the tannoy system which ran around Electric Lady studios (Jimi's own studios) and captured Jimi working (presumably without his knowledge or consent !). 
What we have here is a fly-on-the-wall insight into one of his last studio 
session. 
Front artwork included.
