RELEASE NOTES/DESCRIPTION:

our first release!! ;)    we'll see how this thing goes... 

Daniel T. is a "super brain." He can calculate numbers to hundreds of decimal points in seconds and learn new languages in a week. Through a series of real world challenges and complex number problems, Daniel's amazing abilities are demonstrated.

we also included some extra experiments that weren't seen in the program,
from the show in wmv form. don't bitch about the quality; we know it's low- it was given to us like that. ps- we hate wmv as much as you do.
