mplayer -vf crop=352:160:0:40 -aspect 1:1 Part1.mpg "

Quality is shitty, because this is not a true DVD Rip. This is ripped from old VHS tapes, meaning the quality sucks.
If you don't believe me, just try downloading one of these 8 garbage rips. Shame on those who posted these 8 damned torrents."
