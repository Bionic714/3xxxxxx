,PUCCA,2005-04-22T01:29Z,"There´s a file named "" VIDEO_TS.BUP ""   but not   "" VIDEO_TS.BUP.bc! "".... don´t know what it can be, I have recived comments that it´s downloaded fine and working. Maybe it´s the preferences of your program. Or try downloading the torrent again and try over."

,PUCCA,2005-04-27T23:16Z,"It does work, why do you think that almost 300 people already have downloaded this file.The movie works fine as well. Try downloading the torrent again. It seems like it´s those who use BitComet who have the trouble with the download or with the file after download."
,Draedon,2005-04-27T23:59Z,"I have tried different clients (bitlord & bittornado) and tried to  
download the .torrent again. Its not only I who get this error :/ sorry if I sounded grumpy but its pretty annoying when I can download dvd 1 & 3 but not the second one :("

,Pundan,2005-05-16T08:34Z,"This torrent doesn't work for me either. I get the same message as everyone else (I'm using BitComet). .bc! is a temporary extension BitComet puts on the file so programs won't associate the file with themselves etc. When the download is complete the extension will go away.

I tried renaming the torrent as one person said that would work, doesn't work. I have no idea what the problem is, it's a shame that it doesn't work."
,PUCCA,2005-05-17T00:47Z,"I have uploaded a new torrent of DVD 2 (20 minute workout) , try if that works, follow the link below, and please let me know if it works and or does´nt work.
