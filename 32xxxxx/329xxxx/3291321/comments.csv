,Killfly,2007-03-18T15:48Z,"Thank you.  Much appreciated.

I'm prioritizing Upload greater than Download on these and relaxing on download time... no hurry for me.

Guys stay and seed these if you want them all.
Any upload speed is better than none.  For every slow upload with one seeder who gets a complaint I appreciate you 10x more.

Some downtime here for games and possible reboot.  I've got to install a couple drives when I get the adapters to my Abit Seriell SATA adapters.
