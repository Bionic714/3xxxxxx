,Anderss08,2005-03-07T13:13Z,"Wrong categori, NOT a dvd-r.

It´s like calling a Toyota a boat........"
,Johosc,2005-03-07T13:42Z,"Correct cathegory; it is a DVD rip. Then again, it isn't suited for fitting on a single DVD if that's what you mean. But the point is that it's been ripped from a DVD (not TV).

Isn't it a little odd to give it a single star in quality just for being in the !wrong cathegory""?"
,bugmenot1,2005-03-07T15:57Z,"Very good quality.. It's in some weird codec though... It doesn't play on a KiSS DP-1000 or DP-1500, witch plays DivX 3, 4 and 5... But good quality! Keep 'em coming!"
,Anderss08,2005-03-07T16:02Z,"Well, it´s the third one you place wrong, what does it take to make you to do right???????"
,bugmenot1,2005-03-08T00:48Z,"Why the fuck do you care if he places them wrong? Who cares, as long as they get released.. here you go, a penny, now go buy a life!"
,Anderss08,2005-03-08T10:01Z,"Do you thing a pc game that was released on a DVD disc should be in this catagory to??

I can se that you know you wrong, why not just do it right the next time?

This is a very big tracker, if people start to put thing in a wrong place it wount take long before its impossible to find anything!

I think it´s nice that you make torrents but please do it right!"
,PirateCam,2005-03-08T13:29Z,"Maybe what you (Johosc) need to know is that ""DVD-R"" does NOT mean it is ripped from DVD, but it's DVD images. Rips should go in the categori of content: tv or film."
,Johosc,2005-03-08T20:48Z,"OK. I didn't know. I'll change them if it's possible, and I'll upload the others in another cathegory..."
,tissemann,2005-03-08T21:37Z,"Fuck categories.

Thanx for this torrent, you made my and my girlfriends day!

Why all this crap about burning? Just buy a SVHS kable and connect your computer to your TV set.

Thanx again"
,Snurrfel,2005-03-12T09:54Z,Excellent torrent! Thanks for seeding :)
,openupshop,2005-03-17T10:10Z,"Wow, its amazing how rediculious some people are.  i was looking for buffy eps for my g/f for so long and couldn't find any dvdrips.  All I kept finding was incomplete seasons.  This person is nice enough to upload and people are bashing him for category placement.  I have an idea, you don't like what category he put it in, DON'T DOWNLOAD.  

AMAZING, the nerve of some people.  I want to say THANK YOU for the great upload and if you can upload seasons 4-7, it would be greatly appreciated.  

P.S.  You could put them in the chimpanzee category for all I care.. For all those who are having an issue with the category, they have this thing now a days, you might have heard of it, ITS CALLED SEARCH.....

Again, Many thanks to the person who uploaded this....

peace,
SHOP"

,JockeII,2005-03-24T04:36Z,"I fully agree with openupshop, looked everywhere for seasons 5-7 and all the Angel seasons!
You just want to ban ppl like Anderss08!"
,JockeII,2005-03-26T21:08Z,"Damn, 38gig, only got like 45gb free on my harddrive =/
Well, can delete the seasons when i have watched em ^^
Or i just buy another harddrive ;)
Thx m8!"
,Zygot,2005-03-30T15:13Z,Noen som kunne tenke seg å seede sesong 4?
,JockeII,2005-04-01T05:39Z,"openupshop: Of course I use Azureus, and are very well-aware of the possibility to choose which files to download. But well, might as well download it all in a row, deleted One tree hill so i got like 12gb free or so :D

A shame though that the speed on the Angel-torrent has gone down to half :(
But I quess thats something I have to live with ;)

I am on the third season of Buffy now, sure hope our Buffy-loving m8 are uploading season 5,6 and 7 soon, otherwise I´m gonna be sorry :'(

Anyways, thx for the tip about the Angel-torrent m8!"

,tumbler,2007-03-30T01:28Z,"Thanks for the upload Johosc. To those who wonder  about categories: Being able to categorise is what makes us millions of times better than computers. It is what enables us to see something we have never seen before and still work out it's function. Chairs come in a million shapes and sizes but you always know it is a chair. Computers find this very, very, very hard and so we create back propogation networks and bayesian filters to try to enable computers to categorise. Categories make searching, much faster and much easier - but only when people categorise things correctly. So keep your penny and your life, try getting a brain before you criticise the mechanisms that help you find the things you want to download. "
,ekenab,2007-04-20T07:55Z,"Pleas seed, that would make my year!"
