,B33rhound,2008-01-21T09:03Z,"kinda mysterious to watch that you left with 99.6 99.8 % finished on alot of torrents. Havent checked all, but this does unfortunatly look like someone beeing a wise ass leaving torrents stranded incomplete."

,chuckasarus,2008-07-04T22:34Z,I was also stuck at 99% but I found out that you can still use all the files. It's a bunch of crap that rehmbrandt won't see a full download!
