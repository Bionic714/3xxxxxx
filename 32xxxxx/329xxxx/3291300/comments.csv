was worried the licensing would make them drop the series."
,Logon,2005-02-25T23:12Z,why can't I see Naruto when I download from Dattebayo but only from Anbu and Aone???
,solidfox,2006-10-29T14:27Z,"Actually, the Naruto broadcasted on Cartoon Network is censured since it's a kids' channel... It looks REALLY idiotic when they fight and the weapons aren't there! 

Talk about blasphemy. "
