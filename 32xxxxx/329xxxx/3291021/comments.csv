em"
[T],pctorrent,2005-02-27T20:20Z,This film is dual: VO and dubbed in spanish. I add english and spanish sub. 
,Klopski,2005-03-07T17:53Z,It's synkonized in spanish!
[T],pctorrent,2005-03-07T21:29Z,"I don't know if I really understand your problem 'cause film must be sync in spanish and english. You only have to choose the language you prefer. Both languages are ripped from the same DVD and have the same features so there's no difference between them. Get the vlc or bsplayer to display it.

If you want overlook the spanish audio, use the virtualdub to disable it and save the new copy again. Be sure you choose direct stream copy before save it.

Anyway, I check this file before upload and it was perfect, so... Have you checked your codecs??? 

Check all these advices and I suposse you solve your problem.
