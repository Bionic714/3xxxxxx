The Bear (1988)

English audio. Nordic subs ( Dansk, Svensk, Norsk, Suomi). Ripped with menu's and in 100% picture quality. 

Movie about two bears who struggle to keep from being shot by hunters. Not much is said in this movie, but the pictures speak for them self. If you enjoy nature and animals, you would like this movie.
WARNING: Bearsex included :)

I like the uploads where a picture is shown ( example: http://trackerwww.prq.to/torrents-details.php?id=3290723&hit=1)
so here is a test, dosn't know if it works: http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/00/67/30m.jpg

If any of you know how it works, please let me know. I think it makes the uploads nicer.

Anyway: ENJOY the movie
