PLz any1 reply and tell me if these PS files on Pirate Bay actually work ^-^"
,Soir,2006-01-06T00:37Z,"SomeCubanGuy:
The files are there so you can burn 'em down and play 'em on a modified PlayStation2.

I kind of doubt that you will be able to run a lot of these games on the PS2Emu and if you do, they'll run slow. 
The emulator and the hardware it's running on (even if it's a high-end PC) won't give you perfect performance when emulating PS2, actually, you won't even get near the performance an actually PS2 can give you."

Ok, after the 41 rar files are extracted, i get 2 files.
one is a 3.63GB .mdf file, and the other is 5KB mds file.
I open the mds file in UltraISO, and it proceeds to automatically open the .mdf file.
ok, so far so good.
Then inside the 'TEKKEN' folder in the ISO, 
there is simply a file DATA.BIN, sized 2.63 GB.

So how do i burn this?
Do i simply burn it in UltraISO as is opened, 
or do i have to do something to the DATA.BIN file and THEN burn it in UltraISO?

Please advice, thank you."

,bubbamj,2009-07-04T11:54Z,"For everyone wondering how to burn and play PS2 games, Google ""PS2 independence exploit"" (More specifically, ""Free MCBoot""). This will start you on the awesome road of PS2 homebrew and burned games. Next, Google ""Swap Magic"" Swap Magic 3.8 Plus CODERS is the newest version I know of... Also, if using a fat PS2, Google ""HDLoader"" and/or ""HDAdvance"". Lastly, Google ""FAPLink"" and/or ""hdl_dumb"". These programs REALLY are awesome. Swap Magic CAN (not always) let you play burned games. HDLoader and HDAdvance are programs that do the same thing, which is install your ps2 games onto a hard drive in the ps2 (Google USBeXtreme and/or HD Xtreme for slim PS2 owners ^^) Lastly, FAPLink and hdl_dumb both will install games onto the PS2's Hard drive through your home's network (your internet connection). I use them so I don't waste disks burning games that may not work. Be warned, it is very slow to install, but well worth it. My Guitar Hero's 1, 2, and 3 all load songs in no more than 4 seconds! By the way, ""mod chips"" are little electroni boards you solder (melt) onto the inside of your ps2 to play burned games. I cant comment on them, because I don't have one! Anyway, I hope I helped! Have fun, and if you have questions, email me at michealedson@gmail.com P.S. : I WILL NOT KNOW EVERYTHING!!!! (duh!)"

Don't listen to what these other nubs are saying!! I can personally confirm that this game does in fact run on the emulator, at least on my gaming rig it does. 

It takes some tweaking to get the proper speed during battles. (I personally have to run it at 120fps, for some odd reason.) But it certainly does run fine. In fact I even tried doubling the fps further and my rig could still handle it perfectly well. 

So like I said, these other fags are just noobs who more than likely haven't touched an emulator in their life. 

So in closing, if ya don't know what you're talkin bout, STFU!!! =D "

I also have most CPU and Speedhacks options turned ON.
