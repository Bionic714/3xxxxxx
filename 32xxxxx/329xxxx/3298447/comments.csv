,philos0pher,2009-07-15T15:47Z,"I would never imagine that someone could direct a movie which was so realistic in having an atmosphere of a fairy tale. Nothing you see in this movie isn`t even close to being impossible, yet everything that happens doesn`t seem to have a purpose. At least not in the sense which is meant in this realistic reality world that we live in. The best movie I`ve seen in the last year, and would probably be the best of its genre if I could determine which genre it is"
