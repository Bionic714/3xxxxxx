I don´t get this into my mind.
Why do you seed a film, that you even don´t like?  

Deutsche Orginalfilme sind hier am Piratebay gern gesehen, aber lasst bitte die deutschsynkronizierten Filme zu Hause.  "

Personally I like it and thats why i´m sharing it for you.
.
Besides, i totally agree with your opinion about german synchronization. It sucks :) This one is original egrman, of course."
