E.G. Right Click DesktopPropertiesSettingsAdvanced(Video Card)(Performance and Quality)

SOUND AND VIDEO DRIVERS
If you are experiencing any difficulties running the game, be sure that your sound card drivers and video drivers are up to date. 

KNOWN ISSUES: 
* Backyard Baseball 2005 does not run on a Radeon 7500, Matrox G200, NVidia Riva 128, 3DFX Voodoo 2, Sis 315, and any 3DLabs Permedia video card.
* Some Matrox cards have had some graphical issues in Darts and other areas in the game.
* Some ATI cards have had games launch with missing fields after extended play. You can fix this problem by Alt-Tabbing to the desktop and back to the game or by restarting the application.
* On some slower machines, audio can cut out during the intro movies. There is no known fix for this issue.
* The XPERT@WORK AGP 2X 8MB ATI Rage Pro card might crash on launch. Other tested 8MB ATI Rage Pro cards seemed to run without issue.

SOFTWARE RENDERED VERSION:
*For games with some video card problems, you can start the game running a special executable located in the Start Menu at: Programs > Atari > Backyard Baseball 2005 > Backyard Baseball Software Rendered. This mode works better on machines with faster CPUs. Movies and scoreboards may have artifacts around them when played in this mode. NOTE: Software Rendering mode doesn't run on the ATI Radeon 7500 or 8500. 

NOTE: Real-time Virus Scanning can cause framerate drops. If you are experiencing framerate issues, disabling virus scan software can create better performance.


V. DISK CAPACITY AND SWAPFILE SPACE

Backyard Baseball 2005 requires approximately 750MB of hard drive space.

A swap file (virtual memory) is temporary storage space on your hard drive which programs use for 
temporary storage of data.  Backyard Baseball 2005 will use this space when it is running, then it will free this space when the game is terminated.

To view swap file information, from the desktop, click the Start button / select Settings / select 
Control Panel / select System / select Performance tab / select Virtual Memory Button.  For best results, you should let Windows Manage the Virtual memory for you.

Below we list the path you need to follow to access the needed application.  Please follow the on-screen prompts to make sure your connected device is working correctly.
