From the late 90`s into the new millenium the "Mainstream" attempted to
destroy Rock & Roll. Now Rock & Roll Infiltates, Destroys & Rebuilds the
"Mainstream". I.D.R the video album is a full length collection of 12 music
videos plus a whole lot more from CKY, the entity that started the
destruction of mainstream Rock & Roll during the era of terror.
Forcing change for a better resolve.
