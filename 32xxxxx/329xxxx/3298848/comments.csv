,RemingSteele,2005-03-07T04:09Z,"Thanks for this great movie, a real pearl in asian cinematography!

But why did you strip the menu? The movie isn't very long and the menu is always a nice add-on to the simply DVDrip. Please leave always the menu in the next uploads. Thx"
,zenzen,2005-03-07T05:38Z,Ý Subtitles......: English Þ 
,hfw,2005-03-07T07:50Z,"Thanks for an exciting movie and ripping the menues, useless cosmetic and often the cause of snaggs in the IFO-file.

Another 5 cent"
,zenzen,2005-03-07T12:32Z,"i will continue to strip extras and menus when i feel that the actual movie will suffer in quality, like the case was here. now the average bitrate for the movie is 90% of the original, which is very much accepted imho...."
,theanalogkid,2005-03-07T13:57Z,Superbt! Mer Takeshi Kitano (Dolls eller Sonatine kanske) skulle uppskattas!
,MythSpell,2005-03-07T16:31Z,"Yes, I agree menus are a waste of bits. Keep up the good work! "
,BJK84,2005-03-08T21:37Z,"Good work zenzen! Keep em comming :D

ICHI for life :)"
,zenzen,2005-03-09T12:17Z,ill do dolls and sonatine eventually. have some others in mind that i wanna do first ;)
,theanalogkid,2005-03-11T01:59Z,Does anyone have a high-res cover scan for this movie? All the ones I can find are low resolution and highly compressed :(
