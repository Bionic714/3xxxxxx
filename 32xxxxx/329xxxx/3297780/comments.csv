,mic100,2005-07-19T17:24Z,Can Someone post what's in this release exactly
,eternalquestion,2006-06-11T20:10Z,"Yes, please post contents. As well, is the win key fresh?  I've been using Rev1 for a week or so, and the key is blocked.  Granted, Rev1 has been out for almost a year now.  Also, much of the software in it was just a trial install, and there were a few trojans in it (something to expect from publicly distributed OS images).  Anyway, looking forward to this one. Thanks."
