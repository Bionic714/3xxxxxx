,Lillen69,2005-02-19T23:28Z,"mrtim30: how about reading the topic u stupid idiot... at least on my computer it says..  french, no subs... pff... amateurs.... in my opinion there should be a license to use the internet... much like the drivers license... then perhaps noobs would learn something... instead of just being stupid"
