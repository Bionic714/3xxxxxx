,eddn,2010-01-25T19:12Z,"Quality is good, but I'd forgotten what a lame movie it was in some ways.  (Been almost 40 years since I last saw it.)  A cross country 'race' between a 55 Chev, set up for drag racing, and a bone stock GTO, that neither driver treated as a real race?  Would have been cool if they had actually raced!  (The 55 would have had to have numerous changes before it could hope to compete in a 3000 mile endurance race!)
As would be expected, the director didn't know much about cars, (but better than most I guess).  Kept checking the jets (you changed jets with change in altitude or weather in the pre EFI days).  Stupid ending.....
I do recommend you watch it for the cool musclecar era autos.  
And, FYI, the 55 later appeared in American Graffiti with a paint job and a few other changes."

,jimbob22,2011-01-05T01:51Z,"eddn - dude - next youll be criticizing star trek for its theory on the `time space continuum' lol. this movie is classic americana - anyone who has read kerouac or vacationed in an old car across america can relate. and taylor and hopper are icons. this reminds to find the original vanishing point - or any bruce dern film when he had hair lol

cheers, and thx for this classic"
