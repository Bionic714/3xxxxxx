,MrsOften,2008-01-21T08:14Z,And once again... is there anyone who can seed for us please? We're all stuck at 81% :-|
,MrsOften,2008-01-23T16:10Z,Xenimus86? PLEASE seed! Just long enough for one of us to get the remaining 19%...
,MrsOften,2008-02-01T00:01Z,"Okay, I got it elsewhere. Have renamed the files to match the ones in this torrent and added. 100% should be swarming soon"
,MrsOften,2008-02-01T09:58Z,It doesn't work too smoothly. It pretends there are still gaps in files. If you haven't downloaded this torrent yet DON'T DOWNLOAD IT. Use this one: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4006499
,standardsnut,2010-04-26T22:15Z,If anyone's interested... http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5517304
