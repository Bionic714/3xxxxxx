I'll call it a DUPE, not a proper!"
,protektor,2005-07-01T07:03Z,Why the hell did you rip the pan&scan version from the DVD rather than the anamorphic widescreen? They are both on the same DVD so its not like you couldn't have done it correctly. Proper release would have been the widescreen release.
