,pappe,2005-03-09T08:08Z,Subtitles don't seem to work.
,aabalo,2005-03-09T16:01Z,"That's right. No subs. Do you own the original DVD? In that case, ¿could you rip the subpack with vobsub and share it? It should be no more than 10 Mb compressed.
Thanks. Awesome movie :)"
,aabalo,2005-03-09T16:12Z,Correction! The subs are there. There must be some problem with the colour palette. I'll try to fix it with scenarist. Thanks a lot. ;)

,Tickler,2006-06-19T13:31Z,Compression? How did you rip it?  I suspect a movie this long is heavily compressed?
,Duder55,2008-03-29T10:25Z,"Just for the record: According to www.widescreen.org and IMDB ""Mad, Mad World"" was filmed in Ultra PanaVision 70 with an aspect ratio of 2,76 : 1 (!) on the 70 mm prints."
