,dark_light,2005-06-12T14:27Z,"And one more thing and I dunno if it's related to this app or not but... 

After I installed this my PC got strange, internet was very slow and suspect I was infected with something bad. Tryed every trick in the book but the only solution was a clean reinstall. I'm not gonna try this program again. "
