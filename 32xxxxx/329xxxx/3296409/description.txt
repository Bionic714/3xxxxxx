PAHAT POJAT ( or ) BAD BOYS - A TRUE STORY

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323551/

Finnish film for a change :o

Comes with subs in english and swedish, coz what i know, finnish spoken ( and written ) can be a tad too hard to understand if you're not actually livin here ;)

Anyways, my original plan was to put out the full DVD, but i ran out of diskspace, so heres the solution, a 2 X 700mb XViD rip which looks pretty decent on the telly and theres no complaints bout em sounds either.

Right, over to you lot ...

Enjoy.
