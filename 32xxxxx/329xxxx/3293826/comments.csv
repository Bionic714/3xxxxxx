,AssMaster,2005-02-22T22:49Z,Very nice Ghibli/Hamazaki (or how it's spelled) movie! ^^
,oestrogen,2005-06-17T23:09Z,"Undertexterna till den här filmen har, om mina misstankar stämmer, tagits från Disney's release (därav alla extra repliker (så att amerikanska barn förstår vad som händer)) och är egentligen skrivna för hörselskadade (därav alla utskrivna ljudeffekter)."
,Hnisseplutt,2005-06-28T01:20Z,Att blanda amerikanska subtitles (gjorda för amerikanskt tal) och japanskt tal var ju ingen hit.. går ju inte titta på.. sen i slutet försvann textningen helt.
,opusdei,2006-01-03T22:53Z,"redan 58 sek in i filmen blir jag förbannad. hur kan man vara så dum att man släpper  med sådana subs. man tror ju inte det är sant, massa påhittade understatements hela tiden. bah!
jänkarna är fan bombade"
,BasouKazuma,2006-12-18T02:39Z,"What the hell, the subtitles aren't the english translations of the original Japanese audio. They are the hearing impaired subtitles of the English audio. BIG difference. The subtitles just don't match up at all.

What a waste ....."
,ReduxDengaku,2007-02-10T20:40Z,"@BasouKazuma>
Maybe you should learn Japanese and make a contribution rather than complaining about something you didn't pay for or contribute to :)"
,flexalot,2007-11-21T22:53Z,"Well maybe he seeded it for a while and that's contributing.. and if he didn't I wouldn't blame him, who the fuck is so retarded to have this sub AARGHH!!"
,Tylith,2008-05-02T03:22Z,"Basou is right, the subtitles are for the hearing impaired and seem to follow a different audio track than the actual movie. There are times when people are talking and there are no subtitles, there are times when no people are talking and there ARE subtitles, and the last 10 minutes of the movie have no subtitles either.
No I don't speak japanese and NO I don't have any torrents of myself, but don't defend people who upload SHIT torrents. ESPECIALLY since the subs are hardcoded I can't just go get my own .srt files!"
,hannibal2323,2008-05-29T08:51Z,"ReduxDengaku - Dude, what you wrote is so stupid. Firstly, why the hell should we learn Japanese if we have no use for it other than to watch an admittedly great film? Your suggestion is so unrealistic that it defies comment. Secondly, in what way would BasouKazuma's contribution be increased by him learning Japanese? Effective contribution to this site's community does not depend on knowledge of Japanese or any specific language for that matter. Thirdly, just because something is free doesn't mean that it shouldn't be provided with some guarantee of quality. Not doing so undermines the honor system that underpins the entire P2P sharing process."
,xxnhoj13xx,2008-06-01T00:15Z,someone seed plz
,LezDawson,2008-12-07T22:53Z,"Thanks for the warnings, people.  I won't download this shit, I'll get a better version elsewhere. :)"
,Snowflake85,2009-10-15T02:50Z,"Yeah, thanks for the warnings.
As for the Uploader, fook you retard."
,ShineOnYouCrazyTorrent,2011-03-12T19:27Z,...is there no subtitles of this online? Or r u too lazy to search?
,zookap,2011-05-26T05:57Z,I can't believe it! How is there not a single copy of this movie in xvid format with normal subtitles on ALL OF THE INTERNET?!! Someone obviously has one so fucking upload it already.
,dazlizi,2011-08-07T05:39Z,"As others have said, this video's subtitles are NOT accurate. I believe what has happened is, there is no official Japanese language version of the film with English subs.

I think someone took the Hearing-Impaired English audio subtitles and threw them into the Japanese audio video. It works passably well (although the English has tons of extra chatter, which is distracting, when the characters are not speaking in Japanese), except for at the climactic conclusion of the movie, the subs simply go away. Last 10 minutes maybe.

They helpfully come back for one triumphant final subtitle when the credits music comes on: ""[Woman Singing in Japanese].""

..Yes, very helpful. Thank you."
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-02-08T23:26Z,"Absolutely brutal subtitles.

As mentioned they are hearing impaired - so you see all the annoying ""buzzing wings"" ""faint gunfire"" stupid subs.
More annoyingly is how much more subs appear than necessary.
It has subs when no voice can be heard; it has subs for words never said...

I have never seen such poor subs in my life. It seems like an actual deaf person watched the movie several times, and assumed they know what was being said the whole time. Did i mention this person was also blind?

If these are the only subs you can find - for the love of all things good in the world - DONT FUCKING HARDCODE THEM! ITS AN INSULT TO THE MOVIE!

Quality is good - but subs are just far far too bad - and i didn't even know subs had the potential to ruin a movie.  "
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-02-08T23:37Z,"Oh god it just gets worse and worse. i cant watch it... i feel like i'm missing an audio channel where everyone is talking to each other but its not playing... these subs are scum of the earth, why would they make so so so many subs for scenes without voice acting?
The only people who could tolerate watching this with these subs, are the people who are completely deaf."
,eoagtrsq,2012-02-17T02:08Z,"I haven't downloaded this yet, but maybe somebody could try these subtitles and report back:
