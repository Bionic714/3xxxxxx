The wait is finally over as Martin Freeland aka MWNN delivers his 
  blistering new album "Interstate Highway" on Monday 30th June for 
  Dragonfly Records. "Interstate Highway" will include the double AA sides 
  single Axis Flip / Lights Out. One of the trance scenes true legends 
  MWNN seals his reputation as a master craftsman with this superbly 
  produced piece of work. The production across these nine tracks is 
  second to none, and a handful of trance tastemakers lucky enough to 
  receive copies have already have been blown away. Martin's long and 
  illustrious career, began way back in 1988 when his track Urban Acid 
  (Polydor) sold over 65,000 copies, he followed this by releasing 1993's 
  "Moment of Truth" for early trance label "Concept in Dance". 1994 saw 
  Martin fall in with Youth's cutting edge trance label - Dragonfly where 
  he recorded the definitive psy-trance anthem "Teleport",which still 
  recides in Paul Oakenfolds top three tunes of all time. In 1998 MWNN was 
  snapped up Oakenfold's Perfecto (East West) where he released the 
  critically acclaimed album "Earth moving the sun" which included the 
  underground club anthem "Sugar Rush".
