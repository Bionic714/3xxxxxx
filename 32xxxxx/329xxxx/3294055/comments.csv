,eggewert2,2005-08-06T19:33Z,Absolutely wonderful to see this concert again. My deepest gratitude!
,Fredrika2,2005-08-06T21:37Z,"I have forgotten to thank you, Skyman, for uploading this video. I've heard so much about this scandalous concert, the pope having to re-sanctify the church after the concert due to people abusing drugs in church, and such things. It's a beautiful show with all the images of Christian architecture and the analog video mixer images. I only wish I had that Projekt Elektronik sequencer they're playing. It's a marvel and sounds better than any other sequencer I've heard before."

,GerardusLeMonk,2008-01-23T12:45Z,"Thank you Skyman. I never saw them live in the baumann - Franke - Froese line up.
eh, Fredrika, wasn't it the performance in the cathedral of Reims (F) that caused such a fuzz ?"
,Webbpassion,2008-11-17T19:53Z,thank you - love Tangerine Dream
,ektakrome,2009-02-20T07:41Z,Am I the only one who noticed the reel to reel tape player that was in the video. Judging by the looks on the musicians faces. I wonder just how much music was actually coming out of those huge synthesizers.
