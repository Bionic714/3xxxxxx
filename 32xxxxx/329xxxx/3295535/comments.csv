,raegemann,2006-03-17T07:09Z,I know this is like a year later but can someone please re-seed this audiobook? :)

,Bumbacel,2008-10-01T13:14Z,"man, after one month of trying to complete this thing, I'm fed up with it. I will unrar it anyway, cause it seems there's no way someone will seed it so I can make it to 100%. WinRar has the option of keeping the corrupted files, even they are not quite full, but at least I will be able to listen to it. hopefully the corrupted part will not get too much in the way of enjoying the book"
