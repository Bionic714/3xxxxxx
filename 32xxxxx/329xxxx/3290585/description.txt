Game Notes:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Dead Man's Hand is a first-person shooter set in the Wild West.

    You assume the role of El Tejon, a master gunslinger on a mission

    of vengeance. As the story unfolds, you will pursue members of

    "The Nine," a gang of ruthless outlaws who betrayed you and left

    you for dead. Gunslinging, bar brawls, horseback action sequences,

    train chases and epic showdowns are just part of the Old West fell

    in this bona fide "period piece" adventure.
