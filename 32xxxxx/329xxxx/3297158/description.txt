Recorded at the Hammersmith Clarendon, London, during Big Black's final tour in the summer of 1987. The members of Big Black have often been asked why we chose to break up (the end of the band having been announced well in advance) just when we were becoming quite popular. The best answer then and now is: To prevent us from overstaying our welcome.
