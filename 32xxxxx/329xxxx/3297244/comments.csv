,Saulll,2010-02-04T01:23Z,"It worked great!

For those of you who don't know how to install and play the game here's how:

1) Install Daemon Tools lite if you don't already have it (You can download it from: ""http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads/dtLite"")

2)Add the Sims2Ep1 image to Daemon tools. (The .mdf file)

3)Mount the file (Click the icon with the CD with a green triangle on Daemon Tools)

4)When it asks for the key use the keys given in the ""clave"" folder.

5) Install it, when the screen prompts for CD2 mount the CUE file that's in the CD2 file.

6)When finished installing play the latest expansion pack game you have and play!"
