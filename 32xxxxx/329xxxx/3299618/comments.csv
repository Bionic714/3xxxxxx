,Platus,2005-03-09T19:45Z,WOW!
,Unikum0,2005-03-12T17:19Z,YEAH! Very nice.. thanks
,Konri1991,2005-03-14T14:02Z,"Great, but you have better kbps?"
,PiNNHEAD,2005-03-19T08:42Z,"Good thing here, but you should add what kbps they have."
,maxlabo,2005-03-20T21:11Z,"Wow, that's lousy bitrate. Waste of time. Thanks for nothing."
,force_fed,2005-03-21T22:40Z,"i agree with those above.  about 95% of these are in 64kbps @ 22kHz and obviously sound pretty bad.  it's a shame, since there were quite a lot of good stuff in the torrent, music-wise.

might be useful or enjoyable to someone else though."
,CArL-13,2005-04-03T17:32Z,"How about the star wars soundtrack?
How good or bad is that?"
,kentpri,2005-04-17T02:35Z,"Agree. All music should be at least 192k. If possible 320k. Ok the torrent file would be maby 10GB but what the hell. Good music shall always be at good quality? No?
Thanks anyway"
,Pangea2012,2005-05-15T22:48Z,64 kb. You act like you can't hear the difference. Why even bother ?
,Hellper,2005-06-28T09:56Z,mission impossible 1 + 2 in there ?
,DaisyAdaire,2005-07-22T13:37Z,"I dont know what all you people that say its not a good bitrate are looking for but these all sound fine to me.  They dont sound any different than any other MP3 I have ever heard.  The d/l rate is a tad on the slow side, but its steady and hasnt just stopped on me like most d/l's do.  Thanks for putting all of these in one place for us!  :o)

,sinaen,2005-08-08T23:06Z,"Alltså lite dumt att ha jäligt många soundtracks om man bara vill ha ett av dom... i en torrent fil

well, i think it's pretty stupid to have all these soundtracks if you only want one of them.. in one torrent file"
,Countduckula,2005-08-09T11:49Z,"Jamen Varför inte bara avmakera skivor som ni inte vill ha och markera de ""soundtracks"" som ni vill ha då?"
,kloneets,2005-08-11T09:54Z,"bitrate sucks, but there ar so many good soundtracks... If only there was at least 128kbps"
,JoakimLj,2005-08-16T23:56Z,använd Azureus eller BitComet så kan ni avmarkera dom ni inte vill ha =)
,Fillepille93,2006-01-15T17:20Z,Please Seed
,nerd707,2006-01-24T12:50Z,this torrent would be great if the quality weren't so low... 81 movie soundtracks should be at leas 7 gigs but instead it's 3 because over half of these are at 64kbps and are so bad that it makes the torrent almost pointless.... whoever's collection this is needs to really go back and re-rip all the CDs to a higher quality...
,DinoVelvet,2006-02-04T02:29Z,"omg, 64kbps streaming, even 128 is low nowadays :P but thx anyway, now i know if i like the soundtrack and are able to download em elsewhere"
,VertiCoD,2006-02-06T00:38Z,Thx dude really good ine Realyy thx :)
,vagnmattias,2006-02-16T15:22Z,"dåligt format, piss kvalite,"
,Auzner,2006-02-17T09:38Z,Even streamed audio sounds better.  This is worthless.  Unless you need to pick up the tune or something.
,jusam,2006-02-17T17:12Z,Do not download this - you're better off separately getting each soundtrack in high quality.
[V],Ubet,2006-02-18T16:11Z,I'm looking for the music from The Fighting Temptations. Can someone pls make a torrent and seed it?=)

,lil laurie,2006-03-18T06:39Z,"how is it possible to download one song, Mrdebil?"
,nomensnescio,2006-03-22T08:02Z,"Hi,
Unfortunately, people around here are not very polite. When they have an opinion, it's often followed by condesending amd foul language.

Thank you for your effort in submitting the soundtracks.

Could you possibly make a new attempt, and to encode the tracks with 192k or better (or VBR)?

The files can be combined /split into several .rar files, each 2-3gb in size.

Regards, R."
,1stGOD,2006-03-26T15:51Z,Perfect! Simply perfect! Thanks a lot dude!
,pratschm,2006-03-28T21:49Z,"Could someone please tell me where to find the Main Title for Back to the Future II? The supplied file is incorrect.

Also, does anyone have a better version of the ET soundtrack? This one is only 64kbps and sounds terrible.

This torrent was a great idea, but I agree with previous posters - please increase the quality and try again. There are some great OSTs here, but the quality is quite poor.

Thanks for the attempt."

,Toxic_tbg,2006-06-18T14:24Z,"Well.. I thought this might be something for me, since I want alot of soundtracks to movies.

I havn't downloaded all yet, but I'm on it. :-)

BUT!, Im going to delete all now. When I want music, I want music where you can hear what they are singing and so on. And when the quality is this low, you can't. I sounds like you are listning to a tape. Just get me so sick.

So, if you want soundtracks with good quality, don't download this. [Snow] Say's there are some with better quality. But, why download 3gb and then there is only 50mb with good quality, and probably not the one's you are after.

But if someone can get soundtracks of a higher quality... PM me. ;)"

Haha.. kan man inte höra att det är dålig kvalité då är det dags o köpa nya datorhögtalare.. För där är bas i låtar. men det hör du inte p.g.a kvalitén. istället för att man ""känner"" basen så hör man den. det låter typ ""krrrrk"". haha

Men vissa nöjer sig kanske att man ska chansa sig till vad de sjunger o.s.v.. Smaken är som baken.. ;-)"

Anyways, for all the people who are crying that this quality is just not good enough, get your ass out to Walmart and drop $800 for these CDs for perfect quality. I've samples quite a few of the songs so far and I'm more then satisfied, on a pc with pc speakers or an mp3 player you will never know that this isn't 10 gigs of mp3s.

no you dont. use  µTorrent and you can choose which files you want and which you dont, as long as it isn't rar'd as one archive. very handy for collections like this (eg i just dloaded can you feel it out of a 100+ MJ and the Jacksons collection). also the program is smaller and faster than bittorrent, with the same layout and all the features and more. free download"
