 File uknown Div3..........?

Hvorfor er det slik? Har tatt ned det meste du har lagt ut og er som regel svært fornøyd....men dette likte jeg ikke...måtte legge inn VLC for å spille av filmen (og den er tungvindt i og med at den ikke er kompatibel med fjernkontrollen min)....

Er Harakiri også DIV3? Og hva er det? Og hvorfor?"
,kattmusik,2005-03-06T19:17Z,"Tack som fan för denhär, har letat efter den jättelänge. Ugetsu monogatari finns inte månne?"

,Salustius,2006-04-09T16:01Z,"Dear Mr. Toba

Thank you for making available Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"". This is a masterpiece, but so is KWAIDAN.

You list of Asian Movies is impressive, but, and I may be wrong, your taste is for the ""Action"".

Try to watch ""Ugetsu Monogatari"" and ""Naked Island""

Asia is basically a land of peace and Civilization
since 6000 BC. Let's not reduce it to feudal Japan. Island peoples  have a bad tendency to rob and rule the continental, because otherwise they would stay poor, due to lack of resources.

But in the end, they loose because the numbers of Continental peoples overcame them.

Great Britain seems not to have understood that.  In 50 years, they will..."
,Leib,2007-09-20T03:42Z,I was unable to see English subs for this. I did a straight download and played it in the VLC player. Any suggestions?
[T],Ferrelas,2008-02-14T12:16Z,The stuff about island people robbing their neighbours got my thinking of Great Brittan. ;)
,godverdomme,2008-03-14T16:38Z,Just like ehag1 and Leib I could not see subtitles...can anyone give us a hand?
,Wachaww,2008-06-08T09:31Z,"Salustius - I doubt you'll read this as your post was 2 years ago. but I'd just like to say that while you make good points. I don't think the image of Japan is in anyway diminished by fascination with the Samurai genre. There is a romantic appeal that attracts westerners in much the same way it does in Japan with regards to their unadulterated sense of pride, discipline and honor. These are characteristics that aren't synonymous with ""feudalism"" in our eyes. 

Much like in Japan I doubt many people are watching American Western movies with cowboys and thinking about how lawless it was, it's the bravery and skill that is prominent. There is nothing wrong with being entertained with Action. Indeed, we watch movies for entertainment, not usually for the mundane or banal.

That all said, this is s superb film. Thanks much to Toba for sharing."
,clubbervision_6,2008-12-09T19:34Z,Has the problem with the SUBS been solved?
