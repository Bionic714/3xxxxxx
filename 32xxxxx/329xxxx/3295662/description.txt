Review (from Amazon)

Italian producer and superstar dj is back with another speaker busting album of the highest quality dance music around. Fans of Mauro may be surprised though by the albums more hard and dark Techno sound. This album will be one of the most eagerly awaited Dj Albums of the year and so it should be. This is the style of music that has people leaving venues such as Gatecrasher rubbing their hands with delight. Lovers of the more mainstream trance music may be disappointed with the albums more hard and underground techno feel. Gone are the days of tracks such as Iguana and Lizard and a new kind of dance music is being formed. Tracks on this album such as Awseome!!! and Bangkok are well known around the UKs club circuit but Back to Cali and Hongkong are classics in the making. If youve witnessed Picotto live and enjoyed it then you will love this album but if your the more charty dance lover of tracks like Komodo and Like This Like That then you may find yourself quite confused!!!
