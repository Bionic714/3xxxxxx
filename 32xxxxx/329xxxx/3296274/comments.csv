,bugmenot1,2005-03-01T19:43Z,"ok torrent, but installed the app, being too trusting ran registry cleaner and took the programs recommendation on deleting every ""safe"" entry. The backup step sort of hanged but not quite so I took the backup as if it had been taken. Clicked on remove, hanged again and the entry list went bananas. Closed the app and now I've yet to discover what all things don't work anymore. Should've sticked with the earlier version of the software, which was actually useful "
