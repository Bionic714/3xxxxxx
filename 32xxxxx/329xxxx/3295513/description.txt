Review: Equally splendid compilation of the raspy shouter's King label output from the British Charly logo. Contains 20 sides, including a few essentials that Rhino didn't bother with: a roaring 'Rock Mr. Blues' that grants Harris vocal group backing; the lascivious rocker 'I Want My Fanny Brown' and 'Lollipop Mama,' and a celebratory 'Mr. Blues Is Coming to Town.' Harris and King always used inexorably swinging bands â€” saxists include Red Prysock, David Van Dyke (who duel it out on the amazing 'Quiet Whiskey'), Big John Greer, Hal Singer, and Tom Archia.
