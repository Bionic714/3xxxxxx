(...)the nine-member-strong Deep Puddle Dynamics helped to spark one of the most interesting millennial movements in rap music with this debut album.

,TheGWH,2007-12-22T21:08Z,"Atmosphere is a rapper himself, not a group."
,geldski,2008-01-09T14:37Z,"1. wrong! Atmosphere is NOT a rapper; Atmosphere is the hip-hop group comprised of emcee, Slug and producer, ANT.
2. Cage isn't in D.P.D., but...
3. Slug, Alias, Sole and Dose One are."

Thank you for informing the ignorant masses.

One more thing to add.  This isn't Rap.  Whoever uploaded this and said it was rap never listened to it.

Slug is a narcissist. lol I live in Minneapolis less than a mile from his home base, Fifth Element. "
