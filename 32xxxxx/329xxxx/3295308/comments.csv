Yes, very interesting! Your posting and shering this is really much appriciated. 

...If every one would see this as what it is,  time documents and not ""Nazi propaganda"" every one would have a better understanding.

Let's start a new trend on Pirate Bay ;)

After all, NS material is totally suppressed in the media out there."

,vonstussi,2009-03-15T05:49Z,"Indeed this movie is interesting.
BUT WHAT A SHITTY QUALITY.
I still can't figure why/how people make such junk videos on TPB.
I guess they haven't a clue how to do it?
However there is a cheksum file and a .jpg in the folder a bit akward for a youtube quality????
It is so easy to make a DVDRip or a DVD.

Ask if you don't know, I will help you.
Watching this movie is like shooting 22 cartridges in a 88mm panzer. A joke...

Except some deepshit anti-nazi documentaries in English available in DVD-R (like war machine of the third Reich)
Not one original movie can be found in (at least) DVDRip on TPB:

The eternal jew (youtube quality)
Jew Suss (youtube quality)
Panorame
Men against panzers
etc...

Pretty funny way to present a defunct elite movement."
