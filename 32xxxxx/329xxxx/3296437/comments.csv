,chillinstevo,2008-03-24T13:39Z,what do you do when it says insert CD2?????
,checkmate444,2008-04-05T06:10Z,"A little friendly advice. Before you go through the trouble of downloading a torrent get an idea of what it may take to extract/de-compress and mount it.
There are many sources of information available if you take the time to look and learn.
In the end don't blame the uploader for problems that originate with you."
,Dalem50,2008-06-05T03:32Z,"Been looking for this application. :-)
Thanks for the upload, Ogge1!"
,NickyVeee,2008-06-18T23:14Z,"For those of you having problems with installing. Here's what you have to do. You need PowerISO or some sort of virtual drive manager.

1. Mount CD1 in Program
2. Click on Virtual Drive to Install
3. Let it start installing
4. When prompted for CD2, unmount CD1, and mount CD2
5. Continue with Installation.

And you should be good to go!"

I shut down my computer by holding down the power button (since task manager wouldn't pop up), and now whenever I start up my computer, after the windows XP loading bar, I get a black screen. WTF"
