,ghostWolf,2006-06-26T14:48Z,":( Crap ): crap

invalid tree structure causing dvd shrink to crap out

Forcing the burn using the iso results in that the dvd wont play - Copy right intro then nothing...

On thop of this the DVD wont open - a lot of hassle getting the DVD out again.

How about creating a full copy of this DVD - inlcuding all menues, sound track option etc etc

This is really fantastic music!!!
Completely amazing!
I get goosebumps from ""Far Above The Clouds"" on my 1000 W Home Cinema System.
Oldfield rules!

ghostWolf, this is NOT crap! 
It's the full DVD!"
