Plot Summary: Turn-of-the-century occultist Alfred Fischer acquires a mystical medallion and conjures up a slew of ravishing, ravenous demons from the depths of hell. Taking the form of beautiful women, the beasts demand a steady diet of fresh human prey that only a mortal human servant can provide. Almost a century after Fischer meets his mysterious demise, a crack team of parapsychologists investigate the manor and former brothel only to face an obstacle course of seductive sexy spirits, a madman with a satanic secret and a horde of zombies bent on a rampage of carnal slaughter!
