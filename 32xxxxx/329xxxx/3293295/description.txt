After releasing Anchorman (2004) the creators decided to use the extra unused material to create a whole new movie and sell it separately on DVD.

It is made out of deleted scenes, cut subplots, alternative takes and has a completely different storyline. A great extra if you saw and liked the movie Anchorman.
