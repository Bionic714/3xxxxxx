RELEASE NOTES:
--------------

This pack was specifically made for Auto-Installer Deluxe v2.0, however I decided
to release it a little bit earlier so that you all can take advantage of it.

As previous users would have noticed, there are not so many different variations
of the BIOS files this time around, however I have made up for that by including
Debug BIOSes and the X3 BIOS. Please note in order for the Debug BIOS to work
properly you need the Xbox Development Kit (XDK) installed on your Xbox. 

Always remember to check what size BIOS your Modchip requires before choosing a
ISO image to burn to CD / DVD, as the wrong choice can damage your Modchip.

Enjoy this nice little release from Team Xbox-Hq.

* FC Boot means your Xbox will look for F:evoxdash.xbe before looking
  on your C Partition for your evoxdash.xbe file.

* X2.4981.06 is good for 120gb HDDs and smaller, 4981.67 is needed for HDDs that
  are larger than 120gb.

* Debug BIOSes are used by developers and are not needed for normal users. Only
  use a Debug BIOS if you know what you are doing!

INSTALLATION NOTES:
-------------------

1) Find out what size BIOS you require for your Modchip, as flashing it with the
   wrong size can/will damage your Modchip.

2) Use WinRAR to extract the ISO image from it's RAR file. The ISO image will be
   around 300mb when extracted.

3) Burn to a CD / DVD using DVD Decrypter, Nero, or your fave burning program.

4) Read the instructions provided by your Modchip manufacturer on how to flash
   your BIOS after you have burned this CD before attempting anything.
