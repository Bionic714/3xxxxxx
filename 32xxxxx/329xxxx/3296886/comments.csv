,blitzbart,2008-09-11T15:23Z,"i have an xecuter 2.3 lite version.

i selected the appropriate (is this spelled right?) iso-file and burned it (to dvd-r).

the chip has a cromwell-linux ""bios"" and asks if i want to flash and if i want to insert a bios disc. so i put in the dvd and he doesnt recognize it.

does anyone know what might be the problem?

i've searched my eyes square, but cant find anything that explains my problem
