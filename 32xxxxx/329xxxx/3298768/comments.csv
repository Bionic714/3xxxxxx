,proekaan,2005-03-06T16:56Z,"most likely the clonecd,I heard someone said the crack version is just the demo,but not sure.
Anyway,this works fine and is the full game..."
,proekaan,2005-03-06T18:01Z,"No,what client are you using?
But whatever the client says,I AM SEEDING."
,proekaan,2005-03-07T15:04Z,"You know,I'm disapointed that no one comments or rates this upload.If the game works or doesn't,notify it,I'd like to know if I did something wrong or not.
And rate it,so others who consider dl this,would get some pointers if they want to dl it.

THANKS"

,oktan,2005-03-08T12:53Z,how to get it to work? ive tryed to mount in dqaemon but noooot?
,proekaan,2005-03-08T15:39Z,"After you extracted the .bin and .cue files, then mount the .cue file with daemon tools and it should work,at least it works on my computer.If this didn't help,please speficy the nature of the problem."
,oktan,2005-03-08T15:58Z,i know how to mount BUT there is no bin or cue files. it came down as a folder with two folders marked cd1 and cd2 but no bin or iso or cue files .. so ??
,oktan,2005-03-08T16:03Z,btw folder CD1 contains 52 smaller filer and CD2 contains 22 smaller filer ..only 1file in each folder is marked .sfv
,proekaan,2005-03-08T18:02Z,"you have to extract those files with winrar.Open the first .001 file with winrar(right click the file and choose open with winrar) and extract the .bin and .cue file and do the same thing with cd2 folder,then mount .cue file."
,oktan,2005-03-08T19:08Z,"proekaan ty now i got it installed. but when i try run it,it asks for a disc key ? didnt see anyone inte the files ? "
,proekaan,2005-03-08T19:20Z,"there is a crack in the cd1 image,copy it to the game folder and enjoy..."

[T],TheSkaffer,2005-03-09T15:16Z,"Its a great game, I just ordered it from www.play.com
250 SEK-..pretty cheap."
,Leraje,2005-03-11T08:19Z,"It's disappointingly short.  The 8 pilots aren't really choosable. It's just whenever they feel like coming with you. 

Regardless, this is an awesome game. I'll have to push for all of those who enjoy it to buy it. 

Also, if anyone knows some games that are like it, could you tell me? Toxeia@gmail.com"
,Judaz,2005-03-11T11:22Z,Is it the full game or just a demo?
,proekaan,2005-03-11T17:03Z,"This is the full game.
There are games similar to this,try nexus:the jupiter incident and of course homeworlds,I can't think anything else right now."
,Capon3,2005-03-13T18:59Z,Try Freelancer.

,H-man,2005-04-25T10:28Z,"Anybody who can figure out how to get Phantom to take the batteries from the Percusor portals on the last level?
