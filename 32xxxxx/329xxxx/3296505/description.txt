~~~~~~~~~
Star Wars Republic Commando is a squad-based first person shooter that lets
you explore the elite world of the Star Wars military. Leading a 3-man squad
of Republic Commandos, your missions take you deep behind enemy lines on over
14 intense and challenging levels through three different campaigns where you
will face more than ten brutal enemies. You'll have more than a dozen deadly 
eapons at your disposal, but none more lethal than your squad. What makes the
squad in Star Wars Republic Commando so unique is the game's innovative
'One Touch Squad Control' system that allows you to engage your squad with
just one button.
