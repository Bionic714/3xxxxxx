,BaDHaBiTt,2005-03-08T11:41Z,"Why do you insist spamming this tracker? All your bullshit is eating up the bandwidth for the rest of us. The tracker is getting slower and slower thanks to you, todocvcd and the rest of you analphabets."
,beatnick,2005-03-08T13:11Z,"Strange or pure coincidations lately, the TPB is indeed suffering huge timeouts when trying to load the website. Those spanish parasite invasions could be the cause...hehe. 

Lets call Anticimex guys. BTW 100.000 visitors of cockroaches a day could only mean 1 thing: Trouble"
,blindtext,2005-03-08T13:27Z,"Guys, are you all stupid? I've downloaded another release (Alone in teh Dark) from pctorrent  a few days ago that was labled like this one. It is ENGLISH audio with Spanish Subtitels.

And the quality is very good. So please stop calling these guys spammers. They are not!"
,BaDHaBiTt,2005-03-08T16:14Z,"Really? Well, why the hell do they say [SPANISH] then? Why not say [Eng. audio, Spanish SUBS]"

Suerte!    "
[T],pctorrent,2005-03-08T17:45Z,"Thank you  very much ""blindtext"" at the end, we find a guy, that have brain and know that he say

At first, we are a spammers,because we upload movies in spanish, only spanish....in a norwegian or swedish tracker, very good

Then, we star to upload games for PS2 and PC in multilenguaje, but....ohhhh, we continue being spammers :?

At the end, we upload movies in english audio and subtitles spanish, with, may the best quality  in internet and, of course, we are spammers.....

Sorry, but i don't understand....anyone explain me??"
,blindtext,2005-03-08T17:50Z,"@  BaDHaBiTt

Mate, look at the filename if you don't get it from the Release Headline ""English Subs Esp"" (which to me reads: it's in english, sub in espanol). What part of ""english + Sub.Esp"" fromn the filename didn't you understand? 

Please think first before you flame people who are actually uploading new releases ....

You should thank them instead, don't you think? "
,BaDHaBiTt,2005-03-08T20:46Z,"Well, PLEASE STATE CLEARLY in the description IF the MOVIE IS DUBBED or NOT."
