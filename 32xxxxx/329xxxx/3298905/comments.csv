THANKS for this UL!

I've got this cassette and CD stashed SOMEwhere amongst one of my 50-plus CD cases and bags of cassettes but do NOT have the time to go rooting around through them trying to find this so again THANKS for making this invaluable piece of pop rock history easily available!

Devo's latest, Something for Everybody, is a bit of a masterpiece as well!!!"
