,panamvik,2006-07-30T15:36Z,"Ah! I managed finally!! Thankyou all. And specially to Sleazy who did the initial up! Absolutely beautiful and what good reproduction. OK!
Now about the the director. Pan Nalin is from a state in India called Gujarat. A simple village boy who aspired to make films.....and here he is. I will not give my interpretation of the film, as I have no intention of spoiling your viewing of this wonderful film. But I can guarantee that you will gasp in awe at every frame. It's a shame they aren't screening it here.
By the way, can anyone tell me how to make a vcd which I can view on a dvd player WITH THE SUBS!?"
