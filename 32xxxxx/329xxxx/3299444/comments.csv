Any info would be much appreciated!"
,comingupforair,2009-01-03T07:40Z,"Thank you Lazlo.
I have been captivated by the sound of the Lute for about ten years and thanks to people like Julian Bream , Paul O'Dette , etc, this music is becoming more available.
Dowland was a complete revelation to me and this collection is inspiring.
Appreciate your efforts and wish you well for 2009.   "
