However, when I try to play them, I just get audio - even on the net-player VLC (which usually gets the needed codecs from the net).
G-spot just tells me ""no codec installed"", bot not what codec's missing and where to get it.
Can you help? Thanx."
,GalFisk,2005-03-13T15:26Z,"It's normal VCD-compatible MPEG-1, so it's odd that you're having problems viewing it. Try using dedicated DVD player software, it's supposed to be able play VCD as well."
,GalFisk,2005-05-11T20:02Z,Your wish is granted. Now download like you mean it.
,GR81,2005-05-11T23:26Z,Thank you friend.  I'm about to finish but it looks like I'm the only peer.  Hope this great torrent doesn't die!  I'll hold on to it for a while in case any new peers appear.
,GalFisk,2005-05-13T20:52Z,"I had to reboot.
If you need a seed, the quickest way is to message me directly, sinc I don't check the comments on all my torrents that often. But I do my best to support them as long as there's interest."
