These are the original versions of the episodes that were cut and/or redubbed on the 10CD Tom and Jerry set, and the two episodes that were missing. 
The collection is assembled from MPEG versions of Tom and Jerry episodes found on P2P. Be warned that the video quality is not the same as the DVD rips. That doesn't make them any less funny though :)
There is one episode which I was unable to find a good version of, in which a flashback to another episode was censored. The episode the flashback came from is intact however, so with these complementary discs you should not be missing any material.

Puss Gets The Boot
The Midnight Snack
Fraidy Cat
Puss n' Toots
