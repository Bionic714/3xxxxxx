A bandit999 Rip

GBH Live at The Victoria Hall, Hanley, Leeds 1983. 
40mins

This is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. This will fit on 1 x 80min blank cd-r using nero.

If you want to play these videos on your computer in the proper aspect ratio use a programme called VLC Player it plays everything including most incomplete downloads which is very handy. It also plays bin & cue files. It has no spyware etc and is safe to install. http://www.videolan.org/

Please help to seed these files, the longer myself and other posters are stuck going back to reseed the less stuff we can post!

ENJOY!
