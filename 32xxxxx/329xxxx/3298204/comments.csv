,loosbroos,2008-10-10T17:39Z,not trying to sound like an idiot but how do you choose between 3 types of audio & 3 types of subtitles when there is no menu? i've downloaded this & have no choice for any of these - it is in english (ok for me) with english subtitles (which i don't want)
,loosbroos,2008-10-10T18:53Z,never mind - i am an idiot! it's all selected with the video remote! .....i knew that!
