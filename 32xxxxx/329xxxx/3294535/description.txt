<b>Barking Dogs Never Bite | Korea 2000 | (Dark) Comedy | Eng Subs</b>

Yoon Ju (Lee Seong Jae) is an unemployed college professor/lecturer. Living in an apartment with his pregnant-but-still-working wife, Yoon Ju wakes up to the sounds of dogs barking every morning. One day, Yoon Ju has had enough and spots a dog standing in front of the apartment. He kidnaps and accidentally kills the dog. But as his luck would have it, another menacing chihuahua is raising hell.

After a string of missing dog reports show up, the apartment superintendent, Hyun Nam (Bae Du Na) decides to investigate. After she witnesses a dog being thrown off the roof of the apartment, Hyun Nam becomes even more determined to track the killer down . . .

<i>"A comic masterpiece"

The direction and cinematography are as superb as the comic acting and story and dialog. Surprisingly, the film ends on a morally uplifting (non-sappy, non-hackneyed) note -- as forgiveness is delivered with a lost shoe. If I gave ratings, this would get a 10+

The acting and directing are excellent. If you get a chance to catch "Barking Dogs Never Bite" don't miss it. 10/10
