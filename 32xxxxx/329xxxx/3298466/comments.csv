,BlastedToTheSky,2008-05-05T01:10Z,"for fuck sake does anyone seed??!! jESus ChrIST I Only got to 21% on this and i tried two other platipus torrents and they would not finish dowloading either. 

All you have tio do is leeve you computer on and seed, most programs do it for you, so stop being lazy asses and seed damnit, virtually no work required in seeding.

i wish i could severley injur non seeders over the internet but i cannot so i end up throwing rocks at cars"
,TeamAmerica,2008-10-03T18:07Z,I would have really like to get a copy of this but there is no one seeding.  Platipus stuff is hard to find and it is even harder to find when no one seeds it.  :(
