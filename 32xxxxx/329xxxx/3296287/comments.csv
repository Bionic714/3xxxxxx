,Lobac,2005-02-28T20:36Z,Sorry but you must be thinking about the movie  Yojimbo which is itself based on Dashiell Hammett's novel Red Harvest
,mr_mxyztplk,2005-02-28T20:41Z,"kluzz, It's Yojimbo that was remade 2 times first as ""A Fist Full of Dollars""  and later as ""Last Man Standing"""
,Lupara,2005-02-28T21:01Z,This is an independet sequel to Yojimbo. The final score is so bloody that at the time of movies premiere critics told people to avoid the first row in theatres :D
