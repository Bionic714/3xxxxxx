...and as you all can see ""hdfreedom"" has made an a** of himself! FiveEYZ has lotsa torrents and has seeded this one for no less than three YEARS! And what does he get? Sour remarks from an ungrateful parasitic megaleach who never uploaded anything here! Most people here are really bad at showing some gratitude. Shape up!"
,mr_woodchuck,2009-12-15T22:15Z,"thanks FiveEYZ, i have an older system and can only seed the things i download for a short time. i don't have a large HD yet. i am also trying to learn how to copy my own materials so i can become a regular uploader. i DO really appreciate all of you that seed. anyone who doesn,t appreciate it is a true A** and probably should go somewhere else.
just my personal thoughts"
