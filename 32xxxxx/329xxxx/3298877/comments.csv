,hi-tech,2005-03-07T17:35Z,with a size of only 233.62 MB doesn't quality suck?
,blove8,2005-03-07T21:58Z,"It's the ONLY quality available at this time, the quality is acutally pretty good for the file size. Besides, it's not about the quality of the video, it's about the quality of INFORMATION that is contained within it. Get this now in order to educate yourself and others about some very SERIOUS information and then get the DVD quality when it becomes available in another month."
