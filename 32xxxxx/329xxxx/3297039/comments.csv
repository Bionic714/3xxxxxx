,kermit123,2006-05-19T13:53Z,"Thank you all, who kept on seeding. Now, if there were only clear guidelines how to install and run the application. There are a lot of boneheads like me, who know quite little about the science of computing. I did realize, that you have to use a virtual drive to install multiterm. I used virtual Daemon manager, which is free. You just mount the image in the multiterm folder and run installation that way. But how does the damn dongle emulator work? Anyone?"

I was able to install it w/o any problems, however, when I start the tag editor I get the following message:""While no valid trados flexlm licence or dongle is available, tageditors runs in demo mode. Error information: the licence of tageditor could not be checked out from the license server."" Do you have any idea how to solve this issues? Did I do something wrong during the installation? Thanks"
