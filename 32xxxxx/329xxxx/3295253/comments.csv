,Grigorij,2005-03-27T12:05Z,"What player are you guys using?

Neither VLC nor WMP can play this film for me. No error message, no nothing. It just does not start. 
I wanna watch it too!"

,c_moore4710221,2009-04-16T22:38Z,Is this film in English?
,canapple,2010-06-18T23:28Z,"thank you for this.
but why aren't you mentioning basic information like what language this film is in? i am sure it is as irritating for you when you land up on other torrents with as reckless information as you provide."
,biffbiffson,2011-04-23T08:19Z,"i love this movie, but the director is a dick head, so i will never pay him a cent, and pirate it ALL DAY long. sorry, cast, you all did an excellent job, and i'm sorry you had to work with him, but i simply cannot give him any support. google him."
