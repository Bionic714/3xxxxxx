Possibly the kitschiest band of the '80s (as Joy Division was for the '70s), Tears for Fears turned out a small treasury of well-crafted songs during their heyday and helped to define a genre that everybody recognizes, but nobody can name. "John Hughes movie pop" comes close, but somebody should find something more apt. Tears Fall Down collects all their best and adds a scattering of good album cuts. The original albums will still hold some delights after this, but they won't be required listening. If you want more Tears for Fears, check out their strong, though underappreciated, later work like 1996's Saturnine Martial & Lunatic. --Gavin McNett
