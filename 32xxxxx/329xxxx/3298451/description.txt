Warblade

Since it's a PC version of the Amiga game, it looks very similar to the Amiga game and the first 75 levels are almost identical to the Amiga version. But there are a lot of new features and game objects added. The graphics have been updated from the 32 colour Amiga version to 32bit, full colour versions on the PC. It uses some of the new possibilities that a powerful pc graphics card can offer. Fast blitting with rotation and scaling, alphablended gfx for flare effects. Lots of new secrets are added. New subgame and a powerful profile system that will unlock new features as you progress through the game.

Es un pedazo de juego (el Deluxe Galaga de Amiga para PC), en dos jugadores es bestial, muy adictivo. Bajarsolo y comprobadlo. No lo dudeis.
