*    PUBLIC NOTICE    *
********************
I am not here to discriminate... Just wanna inform the public....

This torrent is a collection of different source, TV rips, internet download and definitely not DVD rips.

All files have no uniformity in file size, ranging from 26 MB to 173 MB.  One file was empty ""South Park 310 Chipokomon.avi"" just shows ""Sorry about the quality; Captured from a videotape"" then stops.

This is download is recommended for people who just wanna watch it (or at least one episode).

Otherwise, for the people who treasure (or collect) south park episodes, ehh, just click ""Alt Arrow left"" on Firefox.

Happy Downloading...

PS: Seed your download or else the Torrent monsters gonna get you. (ah! don't look behind)"
