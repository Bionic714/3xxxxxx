,aM1bEK,2005-02-27T22:45Z,"Thanks. Great movie from even greater animator :) Maybe you can upload official R2 Japanese DVD releases of ""Tonari no Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro)"" and ""Majo no takkyubin (Kiki's Delivery Service)""? That would be super :) May favorite from Miyazaki-san :) And if it's not too much to ask: uncompressed DVD-9s unlike this release that is re-encoded from original DVD-9 to fit to DVD-5.
Anyhow thanks again for this great anime."

,mtparis,2006-02-16T22:44Z,"i don't know if anyone besides me has actually watched this once the download is complete, but as with other versions available, the end of the film is a repeat of the beginning. aka you never see the end. great quality, but don't waste your time"
