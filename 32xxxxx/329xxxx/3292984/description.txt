 . ..: CAST / PLOT SUMMARY :.. .   


  Tasty and nutrition-free as a snow cone on a hot summer 
  day, Wet Hot American Summer is silly, hilarious        
  throwback to those mildly smutty early-'80s teen        
  comedies. It takes place on the last day of Camp        
  Firewood's 1981 season, and it's everyone's last chans  
  for romance, self-realization, and of course the Big    
  Talent show.The movie is filled with brilliant comic    
  performances, it looks like the cast just tool over a   
  summercamp and had a great time....
