Could you maybe find a japanese version of 'the great yokai war' with english hardsub ?
Thank you very much"

It's a shame this is the only version I could find."
,osriccc,2010-11-20T07:50Z,"Yup it's the only version you can find right now. The resolution is very, very low... But, ok, it's watchable until a BRIP is done (if this movie EVER gets a Bluray version)."
