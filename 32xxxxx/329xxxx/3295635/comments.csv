How ever, IF it doesn't download to a complete 100% you should still be able to use all  the 15 tracks since the only file you should be missing at 98-99% is the ""readyou.txt"" and maybe the CD covers.

If you feel that you can't survive without the cover, you can download them ""manually"" from:

,krutan,2005-02-27T16:53Z,Can someone upload the C&C: Generals soundtrack?
,Davidow,2005-03-16T17:34Z,"I don't think the C&C: Generals soundtrack has been released in any format, and I dont think they are anywhere to be found as mp3's."

Unfortunately it doesn't countain Face the Enemy 1, which is the best Red Alert track of all IMO.

The only place I can seem to find it is on Frank Klepacki's site as a stream. But I still wish to find the original MP3."
