from the back of the case:
Jack Mudurian loves to song. It's as simple as that. Ask him to sing, and sing he will. Claiming a repertoire of "almost as many songs as Sinatra," I challenged him to sing for 45 minutes continuously. Armed with a hand-held cassette recorder, loaded with a 90 minute tape, we stepped out on to the back porch of the Duplex Nursing Home in Boston, which was where he lived. It was a clear June afternoon, the weather was perfect. Birds can be heard singing in the trees (and another resident, Francis McElroy, can also be heard singing in the distance from time to time). This is the unedited recording of Jack's 129-song medley.
