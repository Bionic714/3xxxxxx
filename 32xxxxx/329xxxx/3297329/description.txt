The band attempted to update the Beatles sound for the new wave era on their debut. A good idea that was well executed, but critics cried "foul" when millions sold after Capitol's pre-release hype (it went gold in 13 days and eventually sold five million copies, making it one of the most successful debuts in history). Get the Knack is at once sleazy, sexist, hook-filled and endlessly catchy -- above all, it's a guilty pleasure and an exercise in simple fun. When is power-pop legitimate anyway? Includes the unforgettable hits "My Sharona" and "Good Girls Don't"
