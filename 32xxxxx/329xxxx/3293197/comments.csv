,incendo,2005-06-07T02:40Z,"Hi! And thanks for posting the torrent mredvin. However, I am appealing for help with this one.... I have the latest version of alcohol 120% and winiso (because I have no cd/dvd burner...$ problems!) and winiso converts the .bin file into one .wav and a .iso track, and I cant get the bloody thing to install. If there are any /.ers here, please take pity upon a poor n00b. Cheers, Robert."
,Kai[CZ],2005-07-08T08:28Z,"bah this game just sucks. I loved Armada 1 and was looking forward for this - but I was very dissapointed. All that was good in Armada 1 is gone and mostly bad stuff was added (including the awful physics - i still have bad dreams about this:) - dont waste you bandwidth on this, download Armada 1 instead"

,shaunbul,2006-09-05T07:00Z,can someone help! Used trial version of winrar to unpack all *.rar files. End up with two files Armada 2.bin and Armada 2.cue. I can't do anything else. Please explain what I am doing wrong
,dread pirate roberts,2006-10-28T05:20Z,"the cue file is a type of CD image...use an emulator program like Alcohol 120 to run the image like a CD...google cue, iso or Alochol 120 for more info"
,dread pirate roberts,2006-10-28T05:23Z,"also, forgot to mention that the bin file is simply a binary file that is used to transmit data across the Internet, for example a peer to peer network like the one used for Kazza, Azureus and BitTorrent, you only need to worry about the cue file"

,moddingmadjohny,2008-06-18T08:43Z,"I found this web site that has got a Star Trek: Armada 2 No CD fix, for 1.0 and 1.1.

Give it a try if your STA2 download keeps asking for the disc.  I haven't try it myself with any of the torrent on this site, because I have got the game."
,oberlerchner123,2010-05-14T21:16Z,"Just keep the CD image mounted or even better write it on a CD.
No-CD cracks will kill Multiplayer."
