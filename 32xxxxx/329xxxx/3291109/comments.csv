,ur2ezy,2005-07-19T13:41Z,"Hi,
Since I can't read swedish...? I was wondering, is this season 1 or 2 and which episodes ...are they in English and with/ or without swedish subs???? 

An answer would be appreciated!"
,k11u,2005-08-15T00:15Z,"Yeah downloaded this a while back, It's all the 18 eps that had aired when the torrent was uploaded so all 12 eps of S1 and the first 6 of S2. All the eps are the same good quality if memory serves me right and looking at the torrent details I'm thinking they're lol-rips, maybe someone else can tell what feed they used for these, but yes they are in english without any subs"
,mrmojo,2006-04-21T18:21Z,can someone seed please?  stuck on 98.4%!!
,twiddledee,2006-07-12T17:54Z,"Since no one is seeding this you may want to try just getting the season 1 or season 2 downloads. They are both seeded. Besides, why would anyone want a season and a half?"
,grabbarnaskog,2006-08-26T18:40Z,är det nån som vet vart det finns subs till dessa underbara avsnitt
,bircoff,2006-12-14T17:25Z,Please seed people. anyoing to get over 60% and people stop seeding.
,emerton,2007-02-06T16:47Z,"IF THERE IS NO ONE SEEDING THIS TORRENT AND YOU WANT TO DL, JUST WRITE IN COMMENTS AND I WILL SEED. I WILL CHECK IN HERE FROM TIME TO TIME.THE SAME GOES FOR EPISODES 7-12 I WILL SEED THEM ALSO.

WHY? BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS SERIES TO GAIN POPULARITY SO THAT THIS SHOW CAN BE FINISHED. WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN IT YOU WILL NOW WHAT I MEAN. THEY CANCELLED THE SHOW, BUT THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THE SHOW WILL BE FINISHED IF ENOUGH PEOPLE SHOW INTEREST IN IT.
