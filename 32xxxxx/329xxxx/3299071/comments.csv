,justinr999,2005-06-24T08:59Z,How do i seed this!?
,justinr999,2005-07-29T23:54Z,"Wee-man, why would you rip Alien Dreamtime? Anyone who could appreciate that kind of movie would know that it is a very niche film and isn't going to sell a ton of copies. My friend and business partner who lives across the street from me is the person who made that movie and is unemployed and 3 months behind on rent while you are stealing his movie. Maybe you can explain it to me. Peace, Ian (ian@magiccarpetmedia.com)"
,thegands,2005-07-31T02:58Z,"please seed again if possible, thanks"
,tomyillnigga,2007-06-22T16:23Z,"maybe terence would just like people to see and hear hes thoughts not think about money.. :)

people need to hear about these things and everyone dont have the money or place to buy it.

this is probable way to get more sells if someone sees it and then is like i have to get the oringinal like it happens to me often.

spred the word so people can change themselfs and change the world..

peace !!"
