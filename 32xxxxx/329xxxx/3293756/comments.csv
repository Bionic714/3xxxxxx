When i searched ""Solaris"" I didn't find it, but when i searched ""stalker"" I found it because you wrote about stalker release in the info here... I think you should rename it because people know the film by ""solaris"" =)

Why is the download so slow :( Anyways, great to see this up, the DVD-R was taking up too much space on my HD :)"
,bjjo,2005-03-18T00:49Z,"I named this Solyaris as it is the original soviet title for the movie, and to not confuse it with the crappy Clooney movie that is named ""Solaris"". "
,fluddyflea,2005-03-18T19:15Z,"ok its just that everywhere else you find it as ""solaris"" =) yes, the soviet original. and even in the movie, on the rocket it says ""solaris"" :)

anyways... great release.... good quality and so on"

,Alf-Slayer,2006-02-24T05:12Z,"Naugas you winy bitch, even IMDB titles the film as solyris.. whats your problem?! If it was up to me it would be one movie-one title.. period. It surely sucks ass when someone makes an alternative title for a movie just trying to sell it better to a different country..  If your really so concerned  then seed it yourself under the wrong name."

,libraton,2006-07-18T06:52Z,"Alf-Slayer: You, my good man, is a moron! What naugas is clearly saying is that one should make it easier for leechers to find the goddamned film! It doesnt matter what name it goes by here as long as it is easy for people to find it. I totally agree that more search terms should be included in every torrent in order to easify search. In the end it doesnt matter what name it goes by, as long as the movie is worth watching. "
,gergmurkey,2008-09-11T13:29Z,"Regardless of title, thanks for sharing bjjo!"
,QuantumDriven,2008-10-26T19:03Z,"WTF, I'll give it a try again, but I'm not holding my breath.
It's like a ghost is in the machine when it comes to this original fucking 1972 Russian Solyaris(Solaris), god-damn-it-to-hell.
And unlike other torrents on here, this and the other fucking Solyaris torrents are making me start from son-of-a-bitching scratch.

bjjo, my man(or lady)are you SURE you and the other torrent hosts for ""Solyaris"" aren't fucking with me? 

Come on, I'm not cussing you, just give it up and tell me if you're screwing with my mind.  It's half funny, considering the theme of that movie, which is the presence of a massive plasma Intelligence that invades the conscious of the crew.

I'm losin' it here buddy, I don't know how long I can fight off the worm in my brain. I am ONE with my PC and don't want to live anymore.
bjjo, what did you do to me?  It's, like, something wonderful... and, my gawd, it's full of stars.....--- sonneymcdey@yahoo.com "
