,SuperHansen,2005-03-11T14:31Z,any one know where i/we can find a crack to this game ?
,renderb,2005-03-11T18:14Z,There is none. At least no propper one that removes the copy protection/emulation detection. So you'll either have to burn it and hope you get a perfect copy. or wait.
,SuperHansen,2005-03-14T18:08Z,"hehe.. shall i burn the hole game down, and reinstall it ?
do you know when it´s on so we can download it ?"
,nudnickii,2005-03-18T20:20Z,"Get these programs. ISO Buster, and Daemon Tools...
1) after installation of Daemon Tools, open D-tools up and on the bottom right taskbar on your desktop, right click on d-tools.
2) Go to Virtual cd/dvd rom, Device 0: and mount Image
3) Find your copy of constantine and mount the first image, when it askes for cd 2 during the installation, just go to device 0: and mount the 2nd cd, then hit ok. it will finish the installation.
4) When you are done installing, just mount the 1st cd again, and you will trick your cmoputer into thinking the cd is always in your drive, and it wont affect any processess on your computer or impair its ability to run.
5) If you still need a crack of some sort, it might be on the following website. This is one of the best websites i've ever found in my life. They will give you registration codes that normally require credit cards, and its all free...
