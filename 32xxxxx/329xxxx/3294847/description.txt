Frontier : First Encounter (Elite III)

Probably the best game ever to any system. (This package
is fixed, updated and ready to play on all windows system
including XP.) But for those who's still young and don't
know what this game is check these links:

I went through alot to get this game. First I Searched
the web and found it on Ebay. Then I went through a week
long auction. When I finally won the auction I had to
create an account on PayPal because the owner wont accept
other payment. Then I had to wait three more painful days
before it finally arrived by mail.

This pack contains:

FFE.rar   : The game files.
DATA.rar  : This is the video files.
ReadMe.txt: This message.

I have splitted the game into two parts incase you only
want the game. It will work without the video files but
it might feel lonely in space so it's recomended. Besides,
it's quite impressive what they could achieve back then.

I have inserted some files to make it work on Windows without
Dos and Dosbox and found out that it also works on XP without
Dosbox. I also changed some sound FXs to more exciting ones.
If you want the old ones just check the FX folder and extract
the original over the new ones.

Installation:

1. Extract "FFE.rar".
2. Execute "ffewin28.exe" to play.

To use the video files extrct "DATA.rar" into "FIRSTENC"
folder. Then turn it on via the in-game configuration.

For those with impressive soundcards (not the motherboard
inbuild) might need to edit the file "ffewin.cfg" under
[SOUND] parameter, to make the mid music use your soundcards
sound library. Just change the 1 to 0 or something. I'm
not sure how but I got it to work on mine.

That's it!

Happy space warping.
