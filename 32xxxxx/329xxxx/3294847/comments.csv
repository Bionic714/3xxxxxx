Thank you."
,deejayrandom,2005-02-25T05:07Z,"Superb, I've just heard their finally starting work on Elite 4 too!"
,Frezzno,2005-02-25T05:21Z,"They have been working on Elite 4 for a quite some time now (since 2000) and when I just started to loose hope I found this:

,Frezzno,2005-02-25T10:27Z,"Well, that's what TPB is for. So much joy it brings. I wish I could do better then this, but this is all I got. I bought this game because it's a good game. And good stuff should be shared.

Your all welcome."
,Frezzno,2005-02-25T10:40Z,"I know that Elite is shareware and you can get all versions from the net. But I think you need win98 or at least Dosbox for it to work. Mine is ready to go on all windows.

Besides, only FFE PC-CD version offers 500Mb of animations and this version is rare. Now I'm the lucky owner and for you all to enjoy."
,Frezzno,2005-02-25T18:26Z,"You are just a harmless rookie and I am way beyond you with 400 kills. No seriously, the ""ffewin.exe"" fixes all bugs plus it makes it harder, you even can't do the jump and dock a station trick. Make sure not to sell your lazer to have more cargo space or the pirates will flock around you. Also follow the newspaper missions att the beginning for easy cash and pirate free space. If you still find it too tough you can run ""firstenc.exe"" under Dos for an easy ride."
,Corelian,2005-03-01T19:20Z,I'm definitely not going to download some modified crap. Why don't you just upload a CD-image?
,Frezzno,2005-03-02T23:18Z,"It was a painful experience to make it work on Win98. Install the game, then edit some files so that the update could be patched. Then you need to edit some autoexec.bat and config.sys to free some memory. On XP it just didn't run that good on Dosbox. But after some thirdparty updates, installation of ffewin28 and modifications of some files it now works on all windows, just as good as the original on Win98 with all updates. Plus you can enjoy score composed by Dave Lowe in full midi output from any soundcards instead if adlib. I have spared you all these troubles just so that you easily can enjoy this classic ride."
,tztys,2005-03-09T13:02Z,"This is one of the top 5 games ever made, thanks. However nowadays the grafix suffer alot compared to todays standards. I found some interesting clones on the internet and x2 the threat is very interesting and it would be great if someone could upload it to TPB. Take a look at the demo at http://www.egosoft.com/"
,Frezzno,2005-03-09T21:19Z,"If you want state of the art space simulator I can recommend Freelancer, if you haven't heard of it already. The game it self is superb, closest to Elite you can get plus extra feature. The game gets even better when you install a free mod called TNG.

From this site http://www.starfyrestudios.com

Freelaner can be found here at TPB and there are still many seeders despite that this game is rather old.

Personally I think this game is better then X2.

,Mystic_Canadian,2006-09-10T22:12Z,seed plz!!!
,Mystic_Canadian,2006-09-10T22:12Z,I have to agree that this game is one of the best of all-time...and most of the time it's under-rated or forgotten!!!
,bepees,2006-09-18T15:20Z,is there anyone that has a seed for this one?
,g323515,2007-01-12T02:46Z,"somehow I allways come back to this one  8P

,big111,2007-09-13T21:51Z,SEED PLZ
,thingf1sh,2008-03-26T20:09Z,What an upload! I have been trying to get this for yrs thanks a lot you are the man hail frezzno
,3261dan,2008-03-31T01:08Z,"This is one of the greatest games ever made, I have to say.
Wont be downloading coz I still have this baby on 3.5 inch disk hehe, but had to comment on how awesome the game is.

Also just incase the torrent dies and there are no seeders anymore, its totally possible to play the full game using the Shareware files and a copy of JJFFE or GLFFE. And all of those files are freely available on the web."
,Amazing69,2008-08-18T03:35Z,"I wil keep this game alive.. it will always have a seed with myself :) as mr frezzno said, good things deserve to be shared :p"
,Fuktup_Fez,2009-01-28T22:39Z,"cheers for this dude! i remember playin elite on my C64! YAY!  although i have got to ask.  why is it that when games used to take at least half an hour to load (what with them being on cassette tapes) i used to sit there patiently, happily waiting with no real garuantee that it would work, and yet now if my ps2/xbox whatever takes more than 3 seconds to load i have a fit of  something akin to road rage? hmmm.  ;-)  "
,nuclearfusion,2009-05-02T01:07Z,"Sorry guys I need to online and just to slow while uploading with my speed, will be back in a few hours and will seed for you....Btw i've a share ratio of 10.0 on this just in case you think im a leecher."
,Thomson486,2010-02-01T20:57Z,Anyone know how to make it work on Vista?
,Thomson486,2010-02-01T21:06Z,"Ops, forget my comment. It seems to work now"
,Thomson486,2010-02-01T21:07Z,THANKYOU!!!!
,Thomson486,2010-02-05T07:24Z,"ONE more question: I run it on Vista no problem, but it only runs in a window that is not resizeable and the resolution is pretty low. Is there any way I can run it in higher res and the entire screen?"
,s20dan,2010-11-17T01:52Z,"@ Thompson.
 Both JJFFE and GLFFE allow you to play in higher res. GLFFE allows up to 2560x1600 I believe.
 Set the res in the ffewin.cfg"
,s20dan,2010-11-17T01:54Z,"Btw, ffewin that comes with this is also called JJFFE."
,chobbler,2010-12-03T22:30Z,Thanks for the upload.. havent played this in years
,tofnuts,2011-06-05T09:17Z,"you, sir, are a prince among men. #nostalgia"
,fslaker,2012-05-08T21:02Z,"Does it run on Win7 64 bits?
I'm gonna give it a try and post the feedback here :D"
,fslaker,2012-05-08T22:30Z,"well it looks like it's working but the ground is weird, it's gray :S
Is that normal?"
