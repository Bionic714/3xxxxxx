Plot: Seibei Iguchi, a low-ranking samurai, leads a life without glory
as a bureaucrat in the mid-XIX century Japan. A widower, he has charge
of two daughters (whom he adores) and a senile mother; he must
therefore work in the fields and accept piecework to make ends meet.
New prospects seem to open up when Tomoe, his long-time love, divorces
a brutal husband. However, even as the Japanese feudal system is
unraveling, Seibei remains bound by the code of honour of the samurai
and by his own sense of social precedences. The consequences are cruel.
