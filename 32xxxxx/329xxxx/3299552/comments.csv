,kappaknight,2005-07-06T04:22Z,Do I have to wait for the complete torrent to download before I can play the files?  I guess some are still incomplete while others are saying the codec is not compatible.  (But episode 56 from the other torrent worked just fine.)

It is a shame you don't get quality cartoons like duck tales these days, all the crappy cheap American cartoons you have these days, sponge bob is just one example of how brain dead cartoons are these days and how stupid we program our kids to be."
