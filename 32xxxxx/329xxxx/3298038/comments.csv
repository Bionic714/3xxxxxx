MĂĽnga skiter helt i att informera om vad de delar ut."
,TheAbsorbant,2005-03-07T01:09Z,"Do you have ""Part II - The Metal Years"" as well?"
,malco23,2005-03-09T05:15Z,"No, I don't have part II. Sorry!"
,blownchunks,2006-07-13T08:28Z,could we get some seeders? thanks!
,hothcanada,2006-12-17T15:48Z,this has to be one of the slowest torrents I've ever seen.....why bother leaving a window open if you're not willing to give even 3mbps??
,acoustic_kitty,2007-04-05T09:59Z,"I'd appreciate if someone could seed. 

Thanks"
,gringopig,2007-12-26T22:20Z,"Yes, thx for this! Will download/seed...

Rollins ruined Black Flag. I love the earlier stuff.

:-)"
,spankyblu,2008-04-06T22:53Z,"rollins ruined black flag??? you dumb fuck, Glen Lockett ruined black flag... think about it, Rollins was the longest frontman for flag, and he was picked by greg... I highly doubt ever notice the live shits better than the cds????

jesus christ get a life"

,skatepunk89,2010-02-04T01:33Z,Rollins killed it. Jealous Again or GTFO
,jerry6669,2010-03-23T00:18Z,to add to the Rollins debate. Keith Fucking Morris!
,cronj0,2010-11-01T12:41Z,"I'll seed this until it dies completely. Hell, I'll probably indefinitely seed since it appears to be that slow. I can only get about 3MB/ps up, but I'll be glad to contribute to keeping this movie alive!"
,bob5354,2010-12-23T07:03Z,"adding to this, Rollins fucked up black flag, there old stuff was fast and aggressive. Rollins turned them into shit. They started to play 3 mins songs :/ the band was good but he made it lame as fuck. damaged was ok had a couple of good songs but the rest of rollins was terrible. "
,hattaman,2011-05-17T21:39Z,"you hold your fucking tongues, you classless shits. America was lucky to have Rollins. he was a great influence on hardcore and american 21st century music in general. he was to hardcore as sid vicious was to 77."
,kat96,2011-07-29T02:45Z,"Does anyone know where I could find part three?
Also, I don't really know enough about Black Flag to have an opinion on Henry Rollins but does comparing his impact on hardcore to Sid's on '77 punk really mean much? I mean, Sid couldn't even play the bass (very well) and he didn't join the Sex Pistols until after Never Mind the Bullocks was released, so I've always considered him to be more of a mascot than a pioneer. Johnny Rotten, on the other hand, would make a lot more sense to use as a comparison, don't you think?"
,kat96,2011-07-29T02:53Z,"Actually, correcting myself, Sid was only a part of one Never Mind the Bollocks song, Bodies, according to Wikipedia. Whoops. Also, I spelled Bollocks wrong. (Guess I should learn to google before I type.) I don't think the slip-up changes my point much, though."
,MLGKLK,2011-12-22T14:20Z,"Kat96
 I managed to get a copy of part 3 through ebay or something like that and not for $150.00 either, but I was somewhat disappointed there were NO bands being followed it was just a bunch of kids talking throughtout the film although it was interesting stuff it just wasnt what  I was expecting, also to mention it is prolly one of the hardest movies to find unless your willing to pay through the nose for it. As far as this Rollins debate goes he did his thing for Black Flag and did it well but I love Keith Morris the best."
