,dumonde,2005-03-08T15:46Z,"Hittar ingen info om filmen?
Är det SF/skräck eller?"
,Blodhosta,2005-05-26T20:58Z,Is it just me or is the subtitle file not working?
,Blodhosta,2005-06-12T17:32Z,"What's with the retard? 
Anyhow, I'm still wondering what the deal is with the text file. I can't get it to work, and it's never recognized as a working file..."
,AdInfinitum,2006-04-01T16:43Z,"If there's anyone around who still has the full file, I'd be most grateful. File's only for 64% around these days. I'll upload for a couple of weeks without probs, Uni line's fast enough :)."
,thewise1,2006-08-16T07:40Z,"I'm stuck on 96,6% Does anyone still have the whole file?"
