Why can't we all stick to the same set of standards AVI, MP3, MPEG.....instead of peddling every fucking new piece of shit. MKV's SUCK!!!

All this does is make some avi/wav conversion developer a little money fomr us poor wankers who are constantly being fed more and more compressions and crap we don;t fucking need!

Fuck this shit already!"
,Rootsman,2005-02-16T08:30Z,"just because you're an stupid asshole, it doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer. Keep your insufficient old standards, because if you're actually so stupid that you don't know what  is matroska by now, then you shouldn't download movies at all.

http://packs.matroska.org/
Go there and download the pack, retard."
,Rootsman,2005-02-16T08:31Z,oh besides...... Matroska doesn't cost money. It's open source (Unlike DivX5 & avi).
,pax,2005-02-16T14:13Z,"how does .avi cost money?
""AVI is an acronym of ""Audio-Video Interleaved"", meaning that streams of audio and video information are interspersed togeteher to form a file with an defined structure. AVI is merely a container describing the structure, it says nothing about whether or how the audio and video data is compressed.""
if weÂ´re in the business of calling people dumbasses, why not get things right ourselfs :)
just relax, sticks and stones may brake my bones, but words can't hurt me...just keep saying it out loud when ever you guys feel like bitching 'bout something with someone for no reason ;)

peace"
,digirom,2005-02-21T17:36Z,"Sorry for the date, I wrote the date when dvd was out, not the date when the film has been done.
The real date is 1973...

MKV is actually the best video contenair (AVI is very old and not the best, maybe just mp4 could be discutable).

And, if you want to try, test to make an AVI release (so only VFW codecs for video and mp3/ac3 codec for audio) for this film, 2h25, with 2 audio tracks... in 700Mb... Good luck ;-)

Sorry if my english is not good, I'm not english :)"
