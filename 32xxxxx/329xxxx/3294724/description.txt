--- Release Notes 
In my opinion, Gawi (Nightmare) is one of the stronger Korean horror entries, 
standing well above other similar genre flix (Ring Virus, Phone, etc.) Released 
just as the Asian Horror Resurgence seemed doomed to fall into a vortex of 
half assed copy-cat money grabs, Gawi is a stylish and solid flick. At least 
that's my opinion, so after what seemed like an eternity of encoding error 
hells, and unplayable DVDs I finally located a decent, *not perfect* but good, 
copy of the film and now pass it on to you.
