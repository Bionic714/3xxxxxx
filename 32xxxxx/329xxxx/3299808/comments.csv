If you post the torrent on http://www.TorrentMind.com/ you can use the TeamMind service: they will spread the torrent for you on a bunch of other sites so you get more people on it :)

,johnnytoobad,2008-03-01T21:14Z,"Wow, that was incredibly fast! And the best part is that the tags are good. You have no idea how many Complete Discography torrents I've downloaded where the tags were either incomplete or altogether nonexistent. Very good torrent. Thank you!"

,LeeEtta,2009-02-20T10:01Z,"Fuck all!  This is worth downloading!  Are you fuckin' kidding me?

Thanks.  You don't need a best of if you have this!  Well, unless you are truly a hardcore JD fan.

Some of these songs are hard to get, i.e. live shows.

Listen to the music...let it ring on!"
,bmth1991,2009-03-27T01:52Z,looking forward to this download Joy division are one hell of a band
,fac051,2009-03-28T14:23Z,cheers for all the positive comments ... as pointed out there are a few tracks missing .. if you wanna know why its a RAR file its because i didn't want people picking out the odd file here and there and letting the torrent die out .. having said that it looks like the torrent is still going strong .. so thanks to all you seeders out there !
,fac051,2009-03-30T01:21Z,4 years on its still going strong .. due to the excellent seed / leecher ratio you should get the whole file in less than a couple of hours with a half decent connection so please don't bitch about it being a RAR file :-)
,Yoggie,2009-03-31T13:29Z,I hate rar files.  Waste of space IMO
,lesathscorpii,2009-04-08T00:19Z,"fuck rar files, man"

,fac051,2011-08-07T18:49Z,"tags and files should be all in order .. i spent enough time doing it !""! "
