Star Wars Republic Commando is a squad-based first person shooter 
       that lets you explore the elite world of the Star Wars military. 
       Leading a 3-man squad of Republic Commandos, your missions take you 
       deep behind enemy lines on over 14 intense and challenging levels 
       through three different campaigns where you will face more than ten 
       brutal enemies. 
   
       You'll have more than a dozen deadly weapons at your disposal, but 
       none    more lethal than your squad. What makes the squad in Star 
       Wars Republic Commando so unique is the game's innovative 
       One Touch Squad Control system that allows you to engage your squad 
       with just one button.
