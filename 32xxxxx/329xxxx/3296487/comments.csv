,Clas72,2005-07-04T17:41Z,"Great Stuff Dude!!!  Thx :^) It blew my socks off. More like this, it's way too scarce with ""true"" singer/songwriter music like this out there. If anyone like this U might also wanna check out: Iron & Wine / David Gray / David Kitt / Jack Johnsson / JosĂŠ Gonzales / Kings Of Conveniance / Mark Lanegan / Mason Jennings / Nick Drake / Etc etc...
