"Rolling Stone (4/15/04, p.151) - 3 stars out of 5 - "Sounding like the work of a high-pitched Tom Waits, Banhart's second album is full of alternately fragile and quirky folk songs..." Q (p.94) - 4 stars out of 5 - "[E]ven more mesmeric and deep into Nick Drake territory: intense and slightly damaged, especially on the stark love songs..." Mojo (p.106) - 4 stars out of 5 - "Banhart wraps his songs in a gorgeously quavering warble that seems lifted right off some blues mama's dusty 78. A nearly flawless left-field folk." Uncut (p.90) - 4 stars out of 5 - "REJOICING...feels like the work of a man in the midst of a prodigious creative spurt." Uncut (p.74) - Ranked #26 in Uncut's "Best New Albums of 2004" - "[A] mystical trip into an eerie neverland of joyful bohemian blues." Magnet (p.87) - "With his trembling tenor, Banhart continues to traverse the surreal, telling the tales of laughing lemon trees, milky suns and dancing teeth....It's a mesmerizing journey through the dark heart of Brooklyn's lost boy."
