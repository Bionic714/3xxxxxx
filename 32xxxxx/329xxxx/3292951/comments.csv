,kaealy,2005-02-21T16:22Z,"Kan va svårt att få igång på senare versioner av windows över win 98

Can be heard to make this game running on windows above win98 like XP or 2000"
,dilligafftw,2005-02-21T19:48Z,"Try DOSBox on Win 98. It is a Win 32 program so it should work, depending on your CPU.
I know I had Syndicate running on Win 98 without DOSBox but I can't remember if there was any sound."
,fewt,2005-02-22T19:00Z,Fungerar den att köras i kompatibilitetsläge i XP ?
,dilligafftw,2005-02-22T22:28Z,"If I translate what you said right, the game is NOT compatible with XP. You need to download and run DOSBox to make it work. DOSBox is a program to emulate DOS so you can run old DOS programs."
,mindscape,2005-02-24T22:18Z,"Great game, i still have the original.
Sound was always a problem with this game.
manual says: 
1>log on to cd drive
2> Type CD SB16
3> Type SYND
choose language press enter 
select sound on
set soundboard settings press enter
maybe it works !"
