"Liquid Crystal Vision fuses the ancient and the future. It blends scenes of exotic places such as Ankor Wat, Goa, Laos, Japan, and others with superb graphics, sounds, performances, and channeled interviews. LCV presents dancing as one of the means to initiate a far-reaching personal evolution. It contrasts control versus freedom. The impact of the mystical arts movement on planetary consciousness is highlighted during the 60 minutes play time. Liquid Crystal Vision makes an artistic and political statement that leaves a strong imprint on the audience"
