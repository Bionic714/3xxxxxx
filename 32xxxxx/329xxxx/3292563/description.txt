<b>Synopsis</b></p>

Nine-year-old Sam Paretta is dead, killed in a plane crash. Even though it´s been fourteen months since the accident, his mother Telly (Julianne Moore, "Far From Heaven"), still grieves over the loss. But suddenly, her husband (Anthony Edwards, "ER") swears they never had a child and her psychiatrist (Gary Sinise, "C.S.I.: NY") insists she´s delusional. But worst of all, there is absolutely no evidence to prove Sam ever existed. Haunted by the memories of her son, Telly´s search for the truth propels her into a dark mind-shattering conspiracy of unearthly terror.</p>
