,Shaffyre,2006-03-20T12:21Z,"I donate a big chunk of my relatively good income to various charities including Unicef, Amnesty Intl, the PRAY Foundation and others. All who help the poor of the world. If I bought the Live Aid DVD's part of my money will go to the store, another part to the wholesaler, another to the DVD manufacturer, another to the distributers, another to the record companies and in the end there's little left for the poor. In general only about 5 to 6% of the price of a CD goes to the artist/s. For DVD's it's even less as a part also goes to the filming company. If u want to make a difference then donate money to 1 or more charities that help the poor in the world or go and help the people in Africa like I did. Well, I actually did both. Posting here urging people not to download the DVD's but to go buy it won't make one bit of a difference to the poor people of the world. Peace be with u and may God bless u!

Oh, I almost forgot! Thank u very much psychopink for seeding the DVD's!"
