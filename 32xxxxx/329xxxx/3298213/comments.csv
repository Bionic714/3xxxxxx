,Ntsu,2005-03-14T23:32Z,"I dont know about you, but the files I download from this torrent are all messed up. I never had any problems with other files, so I dont suspect my client or my player. To put it simply, some parts are missing from the tracks. And (but this is just my opinion) the voice-talents are a bit over-enthusiastic."
,cranial2,2005-03-16T03:53Z,"hmm yes I noticed that there's one problem with the 3rd file. for 2 minutes it goes all scratchy. sometimes that happens when you make mp3's really dont know why. And in book 01 and book 02 some of the files are a bit louder or the sound is a bit muffled cuz they are made from a tape rather from a CD. Don't know.. it's a pretty old release from 2001. Anyways i really dont mind that. The rest of the books are 100% ok.
