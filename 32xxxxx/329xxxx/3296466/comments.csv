,oskarbull,2006-04-20T20:50Z,"Ryan: Piratebay.org is a swedish site, so the swedish, danish and norwegian users often write in swedish, danish and norwegian. We're fucking multilingual!"
,affi_kaffi,2006-07-23T21:04Z,"need seeds,, går treigt... :("
,attackinghampster,2006-09-16T06:36Z,I really wish the morons on dial-up would get off the torrent sites.  It really bogs things down.  Normally a 2 gig file with 23 seeders shouldn't take more than a few hours tops.  but because there are so many dial-up seeders/peers I can't get above 50kb/sec.  
,john_john_john,2008-03-22T03:53Z,"y are some of these eps mpg and some avi 

and also theres 2 awesomo episodes (its a duplicate)

,Hansen09,2008-04-09T16:24Z,seeding in progress
,Fragcat,2008-06-27T00:17Z,Not one seeder! Not even one!
,Zanarky,2008-09-03T04:00Z,"For anyone wondering about quality...

- Resolution is about 400 x 500. Differs slightly between certain episodes.
- NOT DVD rips, these are TV rips. Expect certain parts of episodes to be cut off by ""Next up, Chapelle Show"" and other junk like that.
- About 23 frames per second
- About 124 to 175 bitrate"
,hustaddk,2008-12-01T00:00Z,genial upload. takker. :) 
,mo4the,2009-01-22T16:04Z,god dammit is the god damm movie in English or not?!!!!
,misspooky,2009-01-24T18:12Z,"the reason ppl ask if its in english or not is because it hasnt been noted under language, so relax guys, and answer the question instead of saying rude words lol. I asume its in original language, english yes, and its not a movie its a season with many all episodes in it.
nice seeding ppl ty:)"
,bob_94,2009-03-13T15:12Z,"its norweigan, fuckstick"
,HataBlattingar,2009-03-28T12:01Z,Thanks.
,jimmyeat,2009-05-12T18:45Z,"BE AWARE OF that the episodes are not in the right order in this torrent, it should be like this:

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121955/episodes#season-8

Also, the mpg-files are of pretty low quality. Just warning you, but thanks for the upload anyway :)"
,dandeedan,2011-10-24T17:50Z,@ least this one is safe compared to that other one floating about=)
,ipodmonesta,2012-04-13T10:42Z,"try this one:  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5019847/
