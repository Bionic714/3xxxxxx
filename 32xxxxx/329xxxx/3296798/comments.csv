,Mr_Modern,2005-03-01T22:28Z,"VERY well said Hitech

come on face it julanissen - you are a hypocrite!"
,Mr_Modern,2005-03-01T22:28Z,"sorry not julanissen, REBL!  : O)"
,hi-tech,2005-03-01T22:29Z,"Oh yeah,  Rebl, if you do decide to share your ignorant thoughts with us yet again, I would like to hear a solid argument for why you have anything against cannabis, but not complaning about alcohol!"
,Zenzei,2005-03-02T01:00Z,"well cannabis is one of the top strongest plants in the world.. it could easily replace cotton, oil, clothesindustry, world hunger.. but well.. i don't think alot of people read the World Health Organisation Reports =) otherwise everybody would know this =)

,hi-tech,2005-03-02T04:40Z,"WarLord: The reason I brought it up, is that you can't really direct a single complaint against cannabis, which isn't equal or worse when talking about alcohol.
And I'm willing to bet a finger that this guy don't have the slightest thing against alcohol!
Therefore it would be interesting to hear a good argument from him.

Even though it's two different things, I do indeed think it's very relevant. Alcohol is legal, cannabis is illegal - where's the logic in that?
I speak very strongly for legalising cannabis, but even stronger for a ban against alcohol! -But I know that will never happen, therefor the comparison is a excellent argument."
,goastyle,2005-03-09T00:17Z,Ganja for life!!
,Kifen,2005-03-30T12:54Z,Legalize it. Now !
,RoboSnut,2005-04-03T20:58Z,"Thanks for the seed m8's :) 

yea.. Leaglize it and then everyone can do as the want."
,Marcaul,2006-06-13T14:19Z,"The reason for cannabis being a relatively new phenomenon (is it?) in scandinavia is due to climate, not culture!"
,mrgreen2007,2007-04-13T02:07Z,"Cannabis is the worlds salvation!! I love it too;-)
Alcohol ain't good for nothing, makes crazy people with their minds left at home...
PS. Please seed!!"
,thiskidney,2007-05-28T16:22Z,"""...the only video circulating around showing nordic outdoors cultivation""

it sounds scientific, but it's just closeups on the plants. i'd like to see more of the surroundings and the cultivation process, and the results. this film is just pointless as it is now, but I appreciate the effort of putting it on torrent. great work!

there are lots of people growing cannabis outdoors in scandinavia, and it isn't the ""cold summers"" that is the major problem, but the short summers. you can get a regular sativa to grow perfectly, but it will probably die before it starts producing buds. just get hold of an autoblooming strain that blooms in 7weeks and it's no challenge for the nordic climate. cannabis ruderalis has its origin in russia, so a ruderalis/indica hybrid is perfect, though it does produce a lot less yield than in warmer climates."
