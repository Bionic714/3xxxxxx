A family rule forbids her from dating until her unpopular, rebellious, boy-hating older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) gets a suitor of her own. In an attempt to win Bianca, a potential boyfriend (Andrew Keegan) desperately attempts to set Kat up with Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), another rebel whom may just be able to win Kat's heart.
