Yea I blame you...

If You did know something about Bruce Lee and his movies, you would have checked this movie fore some non understanderbel reasons to cencured so many scenes on a so old movie from 1973, before uploading it... 

All that many scenes they have cencured, is scenes who is legal to children toodag on maby 8 years...  For me ( and 100 % for all other Bruce Lee's freaks ) this movie is totally destroyd. 

The only thing I can do with it, is to give it to some one I do not like...

Shit..."
,Oldschool,2005-03-01T23:58Z,"Well then go ahead give it to whoever you want you

Bry dig inte om folk som klagar!  99% är garanterat glada åt uploaden. Visst jag blev också besviken att den var censurerad, men så var det på kommunist tiden i Sverige och knappast ditt fel! Tack gode gud är den borta nu.

Tack för filmen."
,DARKVIKING,2005-03-29T22:49Z,"I am happy to finally get this on DVD, but was also a little disapointed with the cuting. I have the ""real"" Enter the dragon on VHS, and i counted atleast 4 scenes which were cut. And cut BADLY.
So thumbs up for a ""limited"" Enter the dragon DVD release, but i will still show the VHS version to my friends, because the cuting really dragged the overall experience down.
If you should come by the original release on DVD, then please post, gonna make many bruce lee fans real happy. (Me inluded)

And i also read and understood the swedish comments, if anyone was wondering.

Keep up the good work, and i guess you couldn't know this was a cut version when the DVD was labeled Extended."
,OlegL,2005-07-06T05:29Z,"Hi! Hopefully, one day someone will upload the uncut version of Enter the Dragon. Until that day comes, I am happy to start downloading this extented version soon. Thank you for providing the file! I am glad it is in the DVD MPEG-PS format because it makes it easy to watch all the pieces in a partially downloaded file unlike the avi format. Avi sucks! "
,bøttefortwo,2005-08-14T00:55Z,"Kio(San): You are an idiot! Since you know so much about BL, I guess it's no problem for you; you can tell right away it's not the film you are looking for. Furthermore, being such a vice guy, you should be putting up a torrent yourself with the ""real"" deal. If what you find here doesn't suit you, shut up and / or buy the movie you are looking for!"
,lookensee,2005-08-15T23:58Z,"Good Luck getting the uncut version, I saw the this when it came out, next time I saw it a few months later in the US and it was different. I think the only original version is the asian version, with an extended ending, (compared to the usa version) it had the soldiers landing with helicopters and rushing out with bruce making cracks to the ambasador, there was a few other scenes that weren't in the US theatre version either."
,liamster,2006-02-20T20:17Z,"I have the FULL dvd version of this movie...
AND I SEE THAT MANY OF YOU GUYS WANT A UNCUT VERSION!

So in a day or two i will put up a new torrent with Enter The Dragon the FULL version /cheers

You will find the link here..."

,LionSword,2007-11-27T22:20Z,"Den här filmen är klippt i den scen där Lee fightas mot O´Hara. Hur kan den kallas för ""extended"" då?

This movie is cut in the Scene where Lee is fighting O´Hara. How can It then be called ""extended""?"
,kpsalidas,2008-01-22T10:44Z,In this movie Bruce Lee is a mystic agent and goes to a tournament of martial arts and find out that the commander is criminal...Very good movie by the master of martial arts Bruce Lee. For more information go to http://www.wing-chun.ws/Enter%20the%20dragon.html
,The_Hermit_1971,2008-06-05T07:10Z,Is this NTSC or PAL?
,turnul,2008-07-20T22:55Z," I am very disappointed in this DVD because is a CUT VERSION!!! The scene when Bolo kills the incompetent guards is totaly missing from the movie! I'm not watching it anymore, I will simply delete it from my drive! It is worhtless! X("
,lol_davve,2008-08-30T00:17Z,"Kan någon lägga upp Fist To Fist från 1973? Det är en Jackie Chan film och John Woo har gjort.

Can anyone lay out Fist To Fist from 1973. It is a Jackie Chan movie that John Woo made!"
,The_Welder,2009-02-16T08:37Z,"This is NOT the Extended version, it's not even the FULL version!!  It is cut during the fight sequence between Bolo and the guards and cut again in the Lee and O'Hara fight sequence.  Further, there is a scene missing whereby Lee has a conversation with the Shaolin Master about Han which is also missing from this version."
