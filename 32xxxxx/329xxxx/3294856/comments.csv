,Bluesoul,2005-02-25T17:23Z,WTH is this? Demands a VODEI codec from a website that doesn't even exist/work? ....
,M0vieMan,2005-02-25T21:04Z,"You can get the codec at http://www.vodei.com , it's free."
,Bluesoul,2005-02-25T21:59Z,"Thanks. The site wasn't working through the day and I could hardly find any info about this codec on the net, thought it was a scam! :)"
,bosshogg,2005-02-27T09:12Z,whats needed to burn one off these with this type of codec
,Digital_Exc,2005-02-27T19:42Z,I consider this a bogus file and ought to be removed!
,jallaballa,2005-03-23T09:42Z,"Agree. Won't work withoout downloading a completely new program. Not a codec, but a PROGRAM. At least that should be cleared out in the info about the torrent."
,urban hype,2005-07-22T04:55Z,The Vodei Codec sucks.  It will work error free for one day.  After that it starts up nags and crashes the media player if you turn off the nags.
,RDCMrT,2007-10-24T19:42Z,You dumb fuck the VODEI CODEX is a virus and if you are lucky it will demand you paying or will install a dialer
,zarcadia,2008-02-27T17:30Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD! 

This should be removed by admin as requires installing an external program (which is dubious to say the least)
