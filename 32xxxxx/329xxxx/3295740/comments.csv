25 years ago I bought an album, Living Chicago Blues  Vol. 2 1978, on which he appears with 4 songs.
The song ""Stranded On The Highway"" is still one of my favourite bluessongs.
Thanx for seeding!"

can you please help a swede that really got the blues. After harddisk crash I lost my Magic Slim CD:s. Can you seed Blues Guitar Summit, Snakebite and Black Tornado. I always seed back at least 250 %. Hope for the best.
PS what country do you live in, and have you listen live to mighty Magic Slim ?"
