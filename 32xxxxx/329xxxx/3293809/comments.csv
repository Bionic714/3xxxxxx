Take care pirates and don't forget to run Protowall when filesharing."
,yourdaddy,2005-02-23T07:56Z,On this archive foobar2000 failed to run the conversion when all files were selected at once. Running the conversion file by file worked better although Sheep gave me some trouble. After it failed I opened the archive with WinRAR and pressed Alt+R. I added all the suspicious entries to the archive and opened it in foobar2000 again. Now the conversion of Sheep.wav to FLAC worked.
