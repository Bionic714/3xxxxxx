,HaLo2fn123,2007-08-02T02:02Z,"Hi,

if you all are wondering how to install this,

1.download a tool called: DAEMON TOOLS!

2.And when it is done installing a red icon should appear on the right of your screen

3.Right click it and go to Virtual CD/DVD-ROM

4.Then go to Device 0: [J:]

5. Then browse for cds.nrg, then install, and there you go! You just got yourself Conflict Desert Storm!

Note: You do NOT need any kind of cd to burn this to, hoped this helped :)

""Mission 7"" file seems to has a problem.
I skip it but later intallation corrupts.
Did you intall the game properly?"

,cptd13,2008-07-16T19:49Z,Dont bother downloading this because it doesnt have the cd's to mount so it wont work..
,-wraithguard-,2009-03-09T01:29Z,"For fucks sake!!!! Noobs!!! its simple use a torrent downloader to download (share! seed afterwards) then use a cd/dvd mounter Deamon tools/power iso, then install! if a crack is required explore your mounted disk image and copy and paste the cracked file to the programs folder.......... if you have trouble blowing your nose or wiping your own arse just google it!!! "
,syncrjr,2009-07-19T00:34Z,"Uhh Can i have a link to crack? Because whenever i try to play, it says please enter the correct cd rom and press ok to try again. or something like that. help"
