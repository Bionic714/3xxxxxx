The video quality is great the whole time this time. Enjoy.<p>

Last time, people wondered what codecs I used - it's DivX, and the audio is Microsoft ADPCM. Sorry if the codecs cause any problems, but I'm using proprietary software for my DVR card and these were the best options available.<p>

<b>Please consider <a href=http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/knuckle50/torrents.html>donating</a> to keep this effort going. I need a new hard drive, because this one is almost full and is corrupt and about to go. I also need new cables, and if I get enough donations for them, quality of the uploads will be greatly increased. I will be uploading all the episodes this season (and maybe longer) if I can keep my computer going. Thanks.</b>
