,tbraybrook,2011-10-29T02:51Z,"I get a black screeen. Only hear an intro after clicking the coolpool appliction icon. I have to bring up the task manager to close it.
My Nvidia GE Force driver was just updated too so that is not the problem. I also put the application icon file to Windows 95 compatabilty and that didn't do anything. Guess I will unistall this now. I will try at a later date if anyone has any suggestions for me on how to get this working.
Oh and I even upgraded the game from Sierra and that didn't work.
