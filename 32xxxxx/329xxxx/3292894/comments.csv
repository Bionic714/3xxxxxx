,affect,2005-02-21T01:35Z,Är lite nyfiken över vad folk tycker om PeerGuardian VS Protowall nu när jag ser att PG inte drar så mycket kraft längre. Vilken är bäst? 
,ancientone,2005-02-21T02:37Z,"Cheers mate....

However, some people may not know or have the MSCVP7.dll that is required to be dl'd and copied to the winnt/system or the windows/system folder

That'll hopefully aid those who will get error messages...

Blocks legitimate users, making your download slower. 

And offers NO PROTECTION WHATSOEVER from the MPAA/RIAA/etc -- who can easily bypass this (easiest way: buy a dozen new IPs every day. They have several BILLION DOLLARS to spend, yanno.)

If you use this, you're just silly."

,DizzyPoet,2005-02-25T21:40Z,"I have WinXp and it crashes my system when updating lists . 

I received an email from PG stating that their Methlab server went down shortly after launching . I am not saying it's the program or it's my system , I'm just saying I have trouble running this version . 

Azureus has a built in IP blocker but I can run it all the time ( the bloating issue ) . I hope when this comes out of beta , I'll be able to use it .
