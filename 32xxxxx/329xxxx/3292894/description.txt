This version is the same beta version that Methlabs are using, the only difference between this one and theirs is the icon and logo (made my own cause theirs sucked)  ..PG2 (unlike PG1) only use about 3-4MB of the system memory and 0 (zero) from the CPU ..even though it's a beta i havent found or had any problems with it ..so now u can download illegal stuff securely (well, ur not 100% secure but ur more secure than if u didnt used it)

<b>Note:</b> By request i've made a installer for this release, enjoy

<b>Note 2:</b> The seeders/leechers stats are a bit flaky currently, so there might actually be seeders even if 0 is displayed on the web page.

<b>Note 3:</b> If a torrent has very few peers, it may take up to 15 minutes for your client to start the transfer. This is normal.
