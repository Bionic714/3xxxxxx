,VinceIP,2009-01-14T19:46Z,"Better than the other 3 cd collection torrent at least, but the filenames are still lousy. I don't know what the tags are like next. I really recommend you Google mp3tag and download it. Free software, and it automatically updates hundreds of tags and filenames at once.

I have to keep my music organized!"
