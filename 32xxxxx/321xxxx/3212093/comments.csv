,saknad,2004-04-08T14:42Z,"Jag tycker att 160 kb/s är helt okej, men helst ska det vara Ogg Vorbis."

,Sura_Espen,2008-11-11T17:05Z,"?When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown,
The dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.?"

,coolmagicdude2,2010-11-06T05:52Z,"If you should go skating,
On the thin ice of modern life,
Dragging behind you the silent reproach,
Of a million tear-stained eyes,
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice,
Appears under your feet.
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind,
With your fear flowing out from behind,
You as you claw the ice.

I love how I get 160kB/s on a 153kB/s connection xD"
,sk8dwn,2011-02-16T03:10Z,"Pink Floyd will never die all around the world. Listened to it when I was 7 when my Dad brought back tapes of The Wall in 94. I listened to it before i knew how to speak English. In 95 We moved to US, I was 8 and still listening to Pink Floyd 15 years later. Just now i Speak/Understand English haha. Thanks for the great download. "

Remember how she said that

Does anybody else here
Feel the way I do?"
