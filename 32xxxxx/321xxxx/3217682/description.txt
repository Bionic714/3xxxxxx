This album is a pure classic in the EBM genre. It is also Front 242`s best release. This is claimed based upon both my personal opinion and what I believe is a widespread view. Includes the hits "Headhunter" and "Welcome to Paradise", but also the manipulative "Until Death" as well as two versions of the experimental and underestimated "Work 242". This album is the best start to F242 and captures the essence of the true 242-feeling. (Amazon)
