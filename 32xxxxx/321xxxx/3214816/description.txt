Point one: Pop music is mostly a repetition of two types of musical and lyrical phrases, the verse and the chorus.

Point two: These elements usually repeat three times in a three minute song, the type usually found on top-40 radio.

Point three: Cut out the fat and a pop song is only one minute long. Then record albums can hold their own top-40, twenty minutes per side.

Point four: One minute is also the length of most commercials, and therefore their corresponding jingles.

Point five: Jingles are the music of America.

Conclusion: This compact disc is terrific in shuffle play. To convert the jingles to pop music, program each song to repeat three times.


This was before Demolition Man, folks! The Residents are VISIONARIES!

Bonus tracks: Yet four more 1-minute songs, three covers of American commercial singles and three more since the Residents thought there should be 50.

Format: 256kbps average bitrate Ogg/Vorbis.
