Got this in my inbox on streamload the other day, liveset recorded on minidisc from a club in greece..

Nfo says:

"Another maaaaasive party is over. Thank God for mini-discs!!
This is a very different mix than the previous M.T.G style mixes. Better in quality and blending (since i wasn't that drunk this time ) and of course free for all ya from the bottom of the nominal level.
Funky,Disco,Tribal,Deep House mixed by M.T.G ........

P.S This cd includes a very special live remix dedicated to Phoenix & Phebe!! God these girls are gorgeous!!"
