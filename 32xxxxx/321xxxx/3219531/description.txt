This is a very rare and beautiful bootleg. With the exception of Beach House Reality ( working title for 6:00 ),
Lifting Shadows Off A Dream and Caught In A Web all of the demos on this two disc set are previously unreleased .
The aforementioned three songs were originally pressed on the rare silver ( internet only ) bootleg Scenes From A
Memory ( Prism/PR-0496) some eight years ago ( indeed before 1999 there was already a Dream Theater CD called 
Scenes From A Memory , a bootleg though , but still :-)
With the release of this bootleg we're at last given the chance to hear ALL the songs that Dream Theater demo-ed some 
months prior to the official recording of Awake in the best sound available . 
This is the second Dream Theater release on this Japanese label ( the first being First Season , Langley Ultimate Series - 180 ).
I'm wondering how on earth a Japanese bootlegger could get hold of these very rare recordings and with a small run of only 
300 copies it's fair to say that this title will be one of the rare and most sought after bootlegs in Dream Theater land.
