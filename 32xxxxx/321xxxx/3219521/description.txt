Dream Theater international fan club CD 2002 - 'The Atco Demos'

'These Three songs were recorded as a demo deal struck with the then Atco label. The basic tracks 
were recorded by producer David Prater, in a single session at Beartracks Studios, Suffern, New York, 
in May 1991. Guitars, keyboards, and overdubs were recorded at Prater's 16-track basement home studio 
in New Jersey. The demo's were then submitted to the label, and on the strength of these three 
tracks, a recording deal was immediately struck. Here, for the very first time, the original demo 
is offically re-issued, in 2002, as a strictly imited edition - which is only available through 
the Dream Theater International Fan-Clubs - to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Images 
and Words album.'
