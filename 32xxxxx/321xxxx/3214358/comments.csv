,kizofieva,2008-06-08T15:02Z,"... RoN:TaP is an expansion pack to Rise of Nations. You have to have the original game before downloading this file, because this file is only the expansion pack."

,streetwisedevil,2008-07-03T13:31Z,"@Jaycce
Did you applied a crack on the original Rise of Nations? If so you have to replace it with the original nations.exe, then you can install, because the installation of Thrones And Patriots will now find the .exe
If not I don't know :P"
,Jaycce,2008-07-09T15:32Z,-_-' i didn't use a crack but i dont have a .exe file ethier
,SaorEire,2008-10-01T10:01Z,"Aeravel, well said.

This place is full of incompetent mutants, that need their arse wiped for them, and like getting spoon fed. If you can't work out what to do, or at least, civilly ask for help, why don't you fuck off? 

Us normal folk who can change the language of a fucking program don't benefit from your presence whatsoever.

KanchiX, and RiseofLegends, you're both tosspots."

,jayjay191,2011-04-02T03:58Z, naitrok you have to mount the cue file on a virtual drive (dameon tools alcohol 120% are two that i would suggest) then you just install it like normal game it reads the cue file just like you having the disk

,z7z,2011-12-08T19:46Z,"to open .bin or .cue, install programs like Poweriso or daemon tools lite. Make sure the file-type association is set correctly and then double-click... But the most convenient means is setting up a virtual CD drive(Both programs are able to do it, AND it's no more difficult than creating a folder). Hope it helps"
