   Notes:
   First of all, we apologize for our fuckup. It appears we had a
   transfer glitch which made the game lockup in level 4. 
   Props to Insomnia's working version, but too bad it doesn't work
   from hdd. For the people who want to finally play this game off 
   hdd, we present this fix.
   If you already burned the Insomnia release to dvd, this fix 
   does not change anything for you!

   Instructions:
   Either apply wam-007insomnia.ppf to the ins-x007eon.iso and upload
   it to your xbox hdd with your favorite transfer tool, or if you 
   already have the Insomnia release on your hdd, just upload the
   default.xbe and driving.xbe included in the fix.
