Game information:
   =================
   
   Telling the story of the North African campaigns of World War II from both
   Axis' and Allies' side, Desert Rats vs. Afrika Korps is Real-Time Tactical
   game in full 3D boosting single- and multiplayer mode. Uniquely, the game
   combines narrative-based missions with the real-time strategy genre. Across
   two campaigns and twenty missions inspired from historical facts, players
   follow the destiny of a German and an English hero, who were once friends
   and who are now constrained to fight each other in this "war without hate".

   Missions range from reconnaissance operations in the desert and urban
   flush-out missions to large-scale sieges of desert fortresses. Each mission
   starts with a briefing and a recap of the historical background to the
   ensuing battle. More than 30 units can be allocated to each side, selected
   in the army management system. Desert Rats is characterised by a high level
   of combat realism and varied combat tactics. A pause feature allows players
   to think over tactics if necessary.
