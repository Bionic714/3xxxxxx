Revolution OS tells the inside story of the hackers and computer programmers who rebelled against Microsoft and the idea of propietary software to create GNU, Linux & The Open Source Movement. Shot on location in Silicon Valley on 35mm film and in widescreen, Revolution OS captures an offbeat group of characters who are three-parts libertarian, two-parts communist, and one part-bad garage band.
