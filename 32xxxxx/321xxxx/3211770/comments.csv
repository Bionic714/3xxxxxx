Är denna dokumentäran skyddad av upprätshovslagen?"

,WeeZ,2006-06-26T07:30Z,"dslight, shush. You dont use a .tk site if you are serious with something. -.-"
,Tatsh,2006-06-27T18:03Z,"Great stuff, but unfortunately ripped improperly. If you have a widescreen monitor or if you watch this on a widescreen TV (I have both), use MPC and press numpad 9 to zoom in properly to 122%. Then it will look correct."
