Hiya everybody!

First of all I want to thank you for downloading this rip;). I hope you'll enjoy it!

This movie doesn't seem to float around too frequently on the internet, which is why I decided to make a rip and share it with you. And which is also why I hope and would very much appreciate if you would be so kind and keep sharing it with others as well:)


REVIEW:

Sam and Molly are a very happy couple and deeply in love.
Walking back to their new apartment after a night out at the theatre,
they encounter a thief in a dark alley, and Sam is murdered.
He finds himself trapped as a ghost and realises that his death was no accident.

He must warn Molly about the danger that she is in.
But as a ghost he can not be seen or heard by the living,
and so he tries to communicate with Molly through Oda Mae Brown,
a psychic who didn't even realise that her powers were real.
