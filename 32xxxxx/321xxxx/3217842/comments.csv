The Duke certainly deserves the title ""Greatest American Composer"" - together with Frank Zappa.

Thanks to The Pirate Bay, I've now a (nearly) complete Duke collection and a (more than) complete Zappa!"

I have finished downloading and the sound is great; only some extremely minor organizational issues on album naming (eg ""Duke Ellington Centennial Edition"" vs ""Centennial Edition"" makes different folders in my music player, but it is easy to fix, AND SO WORTH IT!!!!!!"
