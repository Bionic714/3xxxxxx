You’re Garrett, master thief, seldom seen and never caught, the best at what you do in the dark and dangerous City—which is mostly rob from the rich and give to yourself. But it’s how you do it that makes this long-awaited sequel from Ion Storm an amazing third-person stealth game. 

The depth of gameplay and sheer range of options is tremendous. You’ll decide whether to sneak quietly past the patrolling guard, sap him from behind and climb the wall, or break cover to lead him into a deadly ambush. Select from a full range of gear, including weapons, a series of specialized arrows, and noise suppression equipment. Picking locks is a complete minigame itself, requiring careful manipulation of the thumbstick while detecting subtle variations in the controller’s vibration feedback to operate your lock picks. 

In addition to being more fun than is legal in the City, Deadly Shadows looks simply gorgeous. The interplay of light and shadow, key to any thief’s survival, is rendered in jaw-dropping detail, as are the shadings and textures of the objects that make up Garret’s interactive world. Although the action takes place at night, this is one game that won’t hide in the shadows!
