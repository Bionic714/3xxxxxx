Something otherworldly is happening to the north near I-285. A doorway opens up in the midst of a ball of energy and out steps a man, who quickly learns how to avoid traffic to stay alive. The next day our boys are offering themselves as a snow shoveling service to make money. After Kyle has made his point to Cartman about his lack of work, he has bloodied Cartman's nose the boys see a newsbreak. The newsbreak identifies the otherworldly man as someone from the year 3045 and tells the reporters that he has come back from the future to find work. At the time portal, which follows the one way "Terminator" rules, another man has come back citing the success of the first time traveler's look for work. Stan is intrigued and wants to meet one of the men from the future. More and more immigrants and their families begin to come through the time portal. The boys plan to do some more shoveling when they find out that all their jobs have been taken by time immigrants. The problem starts occurring all over America, time immigrants are taking all jobs for almost no pay and now the present day workers begin to protest the loss of their jobs. The door to the time portal opens wider and many more time immigrants come through the doorway.<br />

Stan comes home from the protest to find out that his parents have hired a time immigrant. Stan complains about the arrival of the "Goobacks" and his parents try to enlighten him on the issue and end their discussion by calling him a "timecist." On The O'Reilly Factor in the "no spin zone" both sides of the issue are presented by a "pissed off white-trash redneck conservative" and an "aging hippie liberal douche." At South Park Elementary Mr. Garrison now has to teach the children English and "future speak." Stan protests his need to learn how to speak their language, they came here to our time, and they need to learn how to speak our language. The intolerant red necks decide to take matters into their own hands when the government refuses to help. They decide to stop the future from happening. Someone suggests that they get that "Global Warming" thing going and usher in a new ice age. Stan tries to order a double cheeseburger at a fast food restaurant but can't make himself understood by the "Goobacks" behind the counter and gets pissed off. Unfortunately for him, his parents here the expletives he uses and he gets in trouble. Back at the protest meeting one redneck suggests that they all turn queer to stop the future from happening. The leader of rally embraces the idea and gets the crowd of men to follow him to the "Little Future" neighborhood, where they all get naked and start making love to each other.<br />

As part of his punishment Randy brings Stan to work, only to find out when they get there that he has been replaced by a "Gooback" who knows something about geology. At the time border, the naked unemployed rednecks (including Randy Marsh) are trying to get national attention for their cause. It is Stan who suddenly realizes that the only way to get rid of the "Goobacks" is to make the future better for them. His speech sets into motion a series of events (to a musical montage) of the present day people working to make the present pleasant. The plan begins to work as the time immigrants begin to fade away. Soon Stan realizes that doing "this is gay," "this is really gay" says Kyle. Cartman says "this is even gayer than all the men being in a big pile and having sex with each other." Stan apologizes to the crowd and calls for everyone to get back into the pile.<br />

NOTE: This episode was originally listed on southparkstudios.com as "Wetbacks from the Future." It was then changed to "Goobacks from the Future." Finally, the day of the premiere, the episode was changed yet again to "Goobacks." Most likely the "from the Future" part was removed because it was a play on the movie title, "Back to the Future," and it didn't work very well.<br />
