One of the worlds most popular female DJs, Baby Anne, has made her mark on the nation.  Her hi-octane sets of breakbeat energy, fused with heavy doses of Miami bass has rocked many a dance floor at clubs and raves from coast to coast.  

Encouraged by her good friend DJ Icey, Marianne started spinning in 1992.  Icey had seen her on the dance floor â€œbusting out great moves and they became instant friends.  He encouraged her to start spinning so she bought her first set of Technics and never looked back.

Her signature sound which fuses Miami bass and electro with funky breakbeats makes DJ Baby Anne a lot more than just a DJ it makes her one of the greatest female DJs in the world. 

2003 marks the year that Baby Anne stepped up to the plate to join an exclusive group of DJs (including Carl Cox, Tall Paul and Donald Glaude),  on Moonshines Mixed Live series:  The only live DJ mix in 5.1 Surround Sound.  Mixed Live is a true test of a DJs skill.  Theres no room for mistakes, and Baby Anne showed the packed crowd at Club Ra  Las Vegas that she can hold her own with the worlds best.
