,Max_Hardisk,2004-10-13T14:28Z,":sick: SEVERE DOWNLOADING PROBLEMS with this torrent?
I have the solution! :yay:

the problem occurs in Creedence Clearwater Revival - Boxed SetDisc 1 - 1961-1967 Pre-Creedence

the problem stems from the 2nd-to-last and 3rd-to-last files in that folder... the ones with the names CREEDE~3.MP3 and CREEDE~4.MP3

those are old-style 8.3 filenames!!!
(as shortened automatically by the O.S.)

and thus they come into conflict with the 6 files having the full song name spelled out, because those too get an automatic 8.3 name, even in XP Pro under NTFS ...
and those names are of the form CDEEDE~x !!!

all this *^%()*&%*&$#&^$#! crap with BitTornado freezing up in this part of the DL has been simply the result of Duplicate File Names!!! GRRRRRRR!!!!!!!

soooo.... my plan is to get all the other files downloaded first, then go back for the affected ones, making the ones with the full file name last of all.

that way, the CREEDE~3 and CREEDE~4 names will have already been used, and the operating system will not attempt to re-use them for any of the fully-named files. :D

It's been working fine for me this way, I have made much progress beyond the point where it always blew up before!  :thumbsup:
