,trombonist15,2007-08-07T22:02Z,THANK YOU for posting this...  On amazon it costs $120 for a used copy and its not available anywhere else!  I will seed this as long as I can.

It is strange that ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" & ""And The Last Crusade"" is easier to find than the second soundtrack in the Indiana Jones series. All of these soundtracks should be available all the time since Indiana Jones is still very popular. After all it is composed & conducted by John Williams. One of the best composer in the world."
