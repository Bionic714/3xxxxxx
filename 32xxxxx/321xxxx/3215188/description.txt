      [Product Description]

      Virtual PC is a powerful software virtualization solution that      
      allows you to run multiple PC-based operating systems               
      simultaneously on one workstation, providing a safety net to        
      maintain compatibility with legacy applications while you migrate   
      to a new operating system. It also saves reconfiguration time, so   
      your support, development, and training staff can work more         
      efficiently.
