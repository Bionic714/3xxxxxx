MOViE iNFO:
Harry Potter actress Emma Watson makes her TV debut in this feature-
length adaptation of Noel Streatfeild's classic novel. Set in London 
during the 1930s, it tells the story of orphans Pauline, Petrova and 
Posy Fossil, who are adopted by eccentric explorer Gum ? although it's
his selfless niece Sylvia who does most of the hard work involved in 
raising them. The girls face further upheaval when their guardian 
disappears, and the cash-strapped Sylvia is forced to take in lodgers, 
but despite their impoverished circumstances, the sisters still have 
grand plans. Pauline yearns to be an actress, Petrova dreams of becoming
a pilot and Posy is a born ballerina ? but with no money, it looks like
some of their ambitions will have to be sacrificed if they want to stay 
together. Victoria Wood, Richard Griffiths and Marc Warren also star. 
The script is by Heidi Thomas, whose period drama Lillies aired 
in early 2007...
