if this is the same as other uploads it might be worth saving your bandwidth for other uploads"
,umphire,2008-01-01T23:19Z,Does it boot ?
,pushf12,2008-01-08T20:57Z,"Yes, this ISO is bootable if you can burn it properly.  It installed cleanly on my G4 Windtunnel computer.  (Thanks.)"
,kgulaalex,2008-01-09T20:09Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL
i have succesfully installed leopard on 
Sempron64 2600 2x512 ram ati9550 256mb
IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR HARD DRIVE
IT HAPPENED TO ME. IT IS NOT A JOKE. THIS WILL CRIPPLE YOUR BOOT FILES:
""invalid partition table""
WITH LUCK YOU CAN INSTALL VISTA BUT NO XP
if you have already installed... leopard is stuck on 60hz refresh rate with no ati drivers and it is IMPOSSIBLE OT RUN WINDOWS APPS ON IT. You will get error.
.
.
.
YOU RISK PERMANENT DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER WITH ANY LEOPARD INSTALLATION.
I am not a n00b and i will not touch os x again after what happened. I AM STILL UNABLE TO INSTALL XP and writing from vista

""invalid partition table"" at boot. BEWARE AND DO NOT DOWNLOAD. i had a perfect case install and still...

DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL ON YOUR OWN RISK. COMPUTER PERMANENTLY DAMAGED WITH ANY LEOPARD NOT JUST THIS ONE. it`s because of hfs.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
i wrote this to prevent otherf from experiencing what i have gone through."
,Wingreen,2008-01-09T20:31Z,"This, OS is only ment to run on a mac. So buy one instead of trying to install leopard on your pc's out there..."
,hipauliee,2008-01-10T15:34Z,"when i try to mount it it says ""no mountable file systems"" what should i do? i dont want to waste
a perfectly good dvd dl if this iso isnt going to work.
can anyone confirm that it works after burning?"
[T],mm3_hellraiser,2008-01-10T20:07Z,"@kgulaalex:

Are you that blunt? This is not for installation on non-Apple hardware. Trying to install this non-patched, non-osx86 disk image will probably damage your system.

You must be a 'n00b', because everyone knows that setting a new disklabel on a hard drive will fix that problem. What's a disklabel, you ask? Right. n00b.

I think kgulaalex  is a little stupid.. He say or call him self "" Im noa a n00b"" .....But is so dum fucking stupid that he is installing the OS in Sempron64 2600 computer... Lol
What a fucking dum stupid idiot.. !!!"
,boyfrom75,2008-01-15T16:05Z,"@@@ kgulaalex @@@

Do you know what a MAC is ?

=Do you know the difference between MAC Intel and PC.?
=Do you know the difference between those processors and what are made for before make that comment and call your self "" Im not a n00b?

Is so funny that he even post the type of computer he is trying to install the OS..

->Sempron64 Prossesor ? lol LOL
->ati9550 Video card ? LOL LOL

If this OS was original designed for Pentium everyone will be happy to have it !!!

Not even the ""OSX86 Project"" have successful installed a xOS on Intel Computers..Not even a AMD can run a xOS Not to mention with the 100`s of hacks that they have try it. 
From ever 1000 computers that have installed OSX86 one or two may work 50%..

Go to the store and buy a book called ""Macs For Dummies""

Bye bye n00by "
,micoozy,2008-01-15T19:38Z,"Hey I am a bit of a newbie, any instructions on how to burn successfully please?"
,Qym,2008-02-11T14:18Z,"
1) Plug in your ipod or mass storage device via FIREWIRE (must be able to store more than 6.56gb durh)

2) Go into a little application called disk utility (found in the utilities folder in your applications)

3) Click on your ipod or mass storage device in disk utility shown in the left column, go to the erase tab and call it Mac OS X Leopard Install DVD and erase it (any journal neither matter)

4) Now mount (double click) the leopard disk image that you illegally downloaded.

5) You should now see the mounted Mac OS X Leopard Install DVD in the disk utility. Return to the erased ipod and click the restore tab. drag the image of leopard to the 'source' section. Drag the erased ipod or erased drive to the 'destination'. DONT click 'erase destination'. Hit restore. Leopard will now copy to your drive. It may take up to 15 minutes so make yourself a cuppa tea and have a little rest.

6) Go into system preferences and click 'startup disk' you should see your current OS and a folder that says Mac OS X 10.5 ...etc. select it and hit restart. It will restart into the installer, now install .The installation will happen faster than via a disk because of the direct firewire connection. I really hope this helps some of you out there. Spread this about on forums if you want, try and help others."
,WOLFTTBB,2008-02-17T04:57Z,"isnt it a reseed ??? from this one here ??? :http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3859875/Mac_OS_X_Leopard_(full_final_release) and more seeders there , much faster download !"
,iouzioufds,2008-02-21T09:23Z,"@Qym: I tried that (before I read your comment actually), but my Tiger must be screwed, it fails with a segfault or bus error. I tried doing it from Terminal with /usr/sbin/asr, same difference."
,phlx,2008-03-22T18:23Z,you don't need a CD key or anything ?

,Omakayd,2008-10-01T01:52Z,"uh, boyfrom75 you are retarded.
you need to learn a bit about osx86 before you open your mouth about it.  there are plenty of people running Mac OS X on their ""non-apple hardware"" including systems with AMD cpus.  I have been using leopard on my Dell optiplex gx520 for almost a year now.

n00b.
also, thanks to new hacks and workarounds you CAN install a retail copy of Leopard on your PC, but at the moment only ""Core"" cpus are supported, meaning... if your cpu has ""core"" in the name you're good, just use google or visit insanelymac"
,SloSnoLeo,2009-01-11T07:36Z,"Hey... Only 49 days left of downloading at 2 KBps...
SEEEEEEED
You should really look out around you... Theres a way of using modified bootloaders to load a vanilla copy of Leo... Thats why ppl download these torrents ('cluding me).... You can Google that."
