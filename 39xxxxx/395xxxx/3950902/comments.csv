it is opening the thing, so i think it's working"

,brainspew,2008-08-13T00:21Z,"This does 100% work. However, there are a couple small issues.

It does not come with any video fx or transitions as mentioned above. Also, it seems to not be able to import as many types of video files as it should. It only wants to import .avi files for me. It's not that big of a deal for most people, just get a converter.

If anyone knows how to get the missing plugins, please say so."
