I stumbled into these street musician when i visited Barcelona this summer. I was so impressed whit what I heard, that i bought the two CD`s they had to offer. They have really captured the balance between the analog and digital, and blends it perfectly.


Here is the CD they call Proyect 2006.
Enjoy
