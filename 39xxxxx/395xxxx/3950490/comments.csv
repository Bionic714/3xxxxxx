but where to get STEAM VERSION OF HALF LIFE 1.

I downloaded half life gold. and i dont know how to run, too. pls help"
,CPeanutG,2008-06-16T01:02Z,"Either get Steam and get Half Life 1 (Not going to say how to get around buying it).

Run hl.exe with the arguments ""-game recb"" (i think it's recb, whatever the folder is that Resident Evil : Cold Blood Beta 2 installs to, just place it into the Half Life directory I think."
