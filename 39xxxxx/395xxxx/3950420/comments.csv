,jeromedevine,2007-12-29T17:36Z,You could have at least given credit to the uploaders that provided this stuff in the first place!
,Beonaam,2007-12-29T19:35Z,"Sorry.
I believe I gave credit in the ReadMe file included which basically is a copy of the description. I thought I updated the description to include you and jeffknight, but apparently not. Apologies."

,rbaleksandar,2008-03-26T14:56Z,"What is the bitrate, cause I've downloaded 2 LOTR OSTs already with very crappy (128 bitrate is NOT good for such music!) quality... ? 10x in advance :)"
,sinister.dexter,2008-09-09T15:04Z,"Dear fans:

please be aware that while this is a great collection of sound track pieces, it is not complete.  Missing from it are e.b. the wonderful ""Evenstar"" or ""The White Rider"" pieces from ""The Two Towers"".  If you want it all, you need the original ""original sound track"" too, e.g.

,soZexy,2008-11-29T13:10Z,"This is a great torrent but it is not without a glitch here or there. Someone please check The Two Towers: Aragon's Return around 1:05-1:12.

I'm not complaining too hard though. This is excellent for listening enjoyment."

,Draco211,2012-02-17T22:16Z,"Awesome torrent!
However, my antivirus software was reporting adware viruses from this torrent, so be wary when downloading this.
Also, the audio clips at 1:10 on the 'Aragon's Return' track. Any fixes?"
,MaxKohler,2012-02-26T15:30Z,"well I downloaded the first track from each and they were all different quality settings...

the first one was VBR ""standard setting"" -V 2
2nd was VBR ""extreme"" -V 0 (the best setting)
3rd was CBR 320"
