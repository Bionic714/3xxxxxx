2/10
Author: Hendu from Wilton, Maine

I watched this whole movie, but I'm not sure why! The idea is that an army sargeant can whip a bunch of convicts into shape and send them on a likely suicide mission to take out some terrorists on a boat. Cynthia makes an appearance as herself and teaches the convicts how to fight. That was the best part and it only lasted about 5 minutes. The boat exploded at the end of the movie and the simulated computer generated explosion was so pathetic I was embarrassed! Please watch this only as a last resort! Rating 2/10 "
