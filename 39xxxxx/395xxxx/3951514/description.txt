Track # 2 from Metronome MEP490, a 45 rpm vinyl EP released in 1959. Swedish vocalist Siw Malmkvist sings "Midnattssolen" (The Mignight Sun Never Sets). This track can't be found on any of the CD releaes. This was picked up from a decent record. Audio was restored as best possible using Adobe Audition, for picking up the audio I used an Ortofon MC20 moving coil pickup connected to a Ortofon MCA-76 moving coil preamplifier. These are great stuff for capturing the true dynamic sound of the old vinyl records.
This is my first uploaded torrent file ever so I cannot guarantee it will work.

Enjoy this track, tributing one of Sweden's finest vocalists ever.
