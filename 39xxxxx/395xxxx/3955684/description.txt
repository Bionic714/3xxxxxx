NOTES:
This is a re-encode off the original source prevail used,which was 1.36gig in size..hence a bigger file
to keep the bitrate.
Decided to do this because the ilt2.0 version was good but had cam sound not direct.
A warning this still contains the auto focus problem which now and again.....but i watched this last
night and for a TS it's good (in my opinion).


WORK DONE:
Done my normal stuff and ran it through a few filters.....changing colour and contrast mainly.
The audio has been taken off prevail releases,to give us direct sound.
Yep this is the same has prevails bit encoded properly and this is how theirs should have looked if
done right.


Ps PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD MY RELEASES IF YOU DON'T LIKE RE-ENCODES OR IF YOU THINK BY SOME
HOW ME RE-ENCODING THEM IS GOING TO MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE R5'S....BECAUSE THEY DON'T!!!!!

Anyway enjoy the movie,it's free!!!!
