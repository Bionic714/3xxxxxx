,SK977,2008-01-04T18:00Z,"Please seed just a little bit more!! I'm at 85.2% after downloading for 6 days...
I will keep on seeding this if I get to 100% so others can get it as well!"
,some_dumbass_in_canada,2008-01-05T16:14Z,SEED THIS SHIT PLEASE....
,some_dumbass_in_canada,2008-01-09T04:41Z,"This is the slowest download ever. 
There is no one seeding this therefore we are all stuck. I've been downloading since this shitty torrent came out and I am getting very pissed off. I've uploaded more than I have downloaded. I think I will scrap this download and get it from a different user.

SEED YOUR SHIT keblarman ..."
