,gomer1000,2007-12-30T22:00Z,Somebody want to seed this? Passware??
,navcho,2007-12-30T22:08Z,"Yes ,I want seed, please"
,hitmeupz,2007-12-30T23:25Z,"What are you talking about, there's a shitload of seeders. This is the real deal Ladies, much thanks to Jetmouse for his hard work & to Passware for uploading."
,Eggmond,2007-12-31T00:07Z,"For MapSource on PC, use the Unit ID 0000000001. Then generate the map unlock code for the map that you want to read in MapSource. 

I've stumbled upon it and it works (at least for Friluftskartan Pro Götaland [id:798])."
,bjornmus,2007-12-31T15:41Z,Tackar för den här ! Den funkar mycket bra .jag har låst upp 5 kartor ..
,Passware,2007-12-31T18:43Z,Where did you get the Pic?
[T],NightyNinetY,2007-12-31T20:12Z,"Dont be too fuckn greedy now..

The new 1.3 means nothing new at all, that was not hard to do manually do before either!

Do just be glad of thisone as long as it lasts!"
[T],NightyNinetY,2007-12-31T20:59Z,"Passware: have you read the message of the owner to this keygen!? It goes here: 
We already have a new version of keygen that is fully compatible with MapSource and passes online registration check. However we crackers and PPCW admins have decided not to release it wide public. I am really sorry to say that guys, but you must understand that we must somehow protect our hard work, and mainly ourselves! This keygen has draught much much more attention that I initially anticipated, and I think releasing fully working keygen wide public would hurt Garmin business pretty hard. I have no (and never had) an intention to harm their business, more or less I was just trying to break another algo (as a hobby of mine) and I don't want to face any legal issues with such a powerfull company as Garmin. 

I think you show very little, or no respect at all! this is NOT YOUR WORK & DECISION TO MAKE!! and u could at least have posted a non fuckn Nazi German version of this keygen, we should have been glad for the simple solution that was out here for everyone, but thisone will for sure destroy upcoming garmin maps to be unlocked..

Just for you knowledge..

,Passware,2008-01-01T13:43Z,"You will find the ""jetmouse 1.3"" using google!
No reason to say things like NightyNinetY does! "
[T],NightyNinetY,2008-01-01T18:17Z,"ok, if it was released public by the author then i am sorry for what i said."
,Nitrox_Diver,2008-01-01T22:24Z,"Guys, is it the ""GPS Unit ID"" or the ""SD Card ID"" you should use with Jetmouse? I´m a little bit confused after reading some topics around...
I have the GPSMAP 60 CSX."
,a13xand3r,2008-01-02T06:19Z,"I am having some problems understanding how to impliment this, can somebody please help!

I have unlocked the mapsource, but when i put the maps on an sd card and put the card in my gps it says ""can't unlock maps""...

What do i need to do to fix this??

~thanks"
,ordepselva,2008-01-04T02:10Z,"I have a GPSMAP76c and I still try to unlock maps (BlueChart Atlantic v9.5)for my gps unit. The problem is that this gps doesn?t allow to access to his directory in any way (I Think), doesn?t let enter the unlock code via the unit itself and doesn?t support sd card, so I think the only way to unlock is via MapSource.
Can anyone help me? If so please send help for pnvsag@hotmail.com
Thanks in advance and best regards."
,ChazInMT,2008-01-05T00:02Z,"DO NOT DOWN LOAD THIS!!!!!!!! 

It works OK, But,
The 1.3 Version of this is available here,
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3957154/GarminKeygen_v1.3__IMEI_Converter_v1.0.rar-ShareAll.rar

and Here

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3959462/The_Ultimate_Garmin_Crack_Pack

The 1.3 is for sure better. Version 1.2 is admittedly ""Buggy"" its creator has written, so why chance it.

Let this torrent ""Die on the vine""

If you're seeding this, quit doing so.

Peace"
