It does have some risque songs by one of the guys starring in the movie and some memorable lines like an old guy hitting on a chick who gives him a price for a date: He replies ""Are you kidding, I don't pay for it."" And she grabs his chin in her hand playfully, looks him in the eyes real close and intense and retorts, ""And I don't fuck fossils for free!"""
,RubberTow,2008-05-04T22:10Z,"To: ChuckUFarley. FU! there is no real DVD of this. I did it from used VHS I bought on Ebay(all that is available) and defy you to do better. If you can't play it, it's yer damn player. The ""DVD"" available of this title on Ebay and Amazon is nothing but a converted VHS rip that was  inferior to the actual VHS tape I got. Furthermore, this is in hi-res Divx, which means it doesn't expand as much to fill the screen and therefore minimizes the many flaws that a regular resolution rip doesn't do. It's in 960 res or better. and you can take your recommendations and shove them because there is nothing better than a Divx rip. I know because I've been doing this shit for years. This is the best damn rip available for this title, bar none. I've researched, downloaded, rented bought copeis of this before and after my rip. Mine is the best. So again, FO!"
,RubberTow,2008-05-12T22:21Z,"RE: The worst part is this was not inverse telicined so there are duplicate and double-image frames.(not if you play it with a decent player, shit for brains, like WMP, VLC, ATI Divx, which I used to create it)

Considering the damage done by converting it to 29.97p AND the upscaling, a higher bitrate should have been used.(Damage, fuck you idiot. this is 10 times better than the original VHS and the same quality original digital rip that I did before restoration you brain-dead bastard)"
,wrocnrob,2008-05-30T20:00Z,"Excellent quality for a VHS source.  It looks as good as some of the poor commercial DVD transfers.

As for the movie, I thought Hardbodies was really funny when I was twenty.  Still, there are some good scenes in it.  I enjoyed watching it again.  I don't know how you did it, but I looks great.

 Thanks, RubberTow"

.....meaning that there is no sound at all in parts of the movie on VLC and 
no left audio in parts with win Movie Player.

I checked the download and I still have 100% ......

...and my players are working fine.

It's possible that you could burn it to DVD on Mono and get all the sound, I haven't tried."
