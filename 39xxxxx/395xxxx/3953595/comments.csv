,Werm,2007-12-30T19:12Z,"Please Read!!!

You and your family are now going to die within 6 hours since you are reading this. You should not have read this. I have tricked you. The only way not to die is to sit on a jar of peanut butter while facing Mecca while naked. Do so within the next 6 hours or your life will end. 18 people have already died because they did not listen and believe. This is so true!!!

Thanks for the post hossahot!!"

,Dick Jerkins,2007-12-30T21:35Z,He stopped seeding. Why the fuck would he stop seeding?
,Dick Jerkins,2007-12-30T21:41Z,"Nevermind, its rocking now."
,dr_whoopass,2007-12-30T21:46Z,"My fault Dick; I had to cut it to 300k and stop for a bit, you leechy bastards were killing my computer :) What speed are you getting (since you are obviously linked to me)? Just for the record for the first hour or so of my download attempt i was only getting 5k a sec then it picked up a lot."
,OleKristoffer,2007-12-30T21:57Z,how much time does it take before it starts speeding up? Mine haven't moved for 15min yet.
,Dick Jerkins,2007-12-30T22:02Z,dl @45    ul @42
,Dick Jerkins,2007-12-30T22:05Z,leechy bastards      LOL!
,dr_whoopass,2007-12-30T22:09Z,"Nice. BTW quality is pretty good (not HD but i hear this wasnt broadcast in HD) and it works on Xbox 360.

Ole: no clue, especially if I am the only one seeding right now. The 800 seeders vs 80 leechers thing has gotta be backwards"
,dr_whoopass,2007-12-30T22:23Z,"I'm kinda new to this so I am looking thru stuff in Transmission and found out there are OVER 12 THOUSAAAND! leechers, 900 seeders, and 2500 Completed(?) downloads. I'm only uploading to 17 ppl for some reason. So a lot of ppl are being assholes and not seeding when they finish. TWATS!"
,Dick Jerkins,2007-12-30T22:29Z,"I see 40 leechy bastards, 5 seeds"
,dr_whoopass,2007-12-30T22:36Z,"Be right back- gonna reboot and try to bump it up to 400k (i'm experimenting with the awesomeness of my connection)

Dick- yeah i only see ""uploading to 17 out of 50"" but i saw the real stats in the details"
,OleKristoffer,2007-12-30T22:38Z,"SEED FFS!!??

1,2 % IN 50 MINUTES!?!!"
,dr_whoopass,2007-12-30T22:46Z,400k u/l now you leechy bastards
,Dick Jerkins,2007-12-30T23:08Z,Holy Shiite! Its smoking now - THANKS.
,dr_whoopass,2007-12-30T23:24Z,"it's a running gag from earlier dude, no offense. "
,buckweet1965,2007-12-30T23:35Z,"Sorry to complain but this is bullshit. Over 1152 ""seeders"" and only 2 are seeding. Yeah, I've done my share of hit and runs, but come on......UFC 79!!! It's shit like this that will be the downfall of torrents, not MPAA or RIAA."
,mudking101,2007-12-31T02:05Z,17 dn 40 up for me
,slippery1,2007-12-31T02:31Z,took about 50 minutes for mine to get good amount of seeds (says 9 out of 1500) but after bout an hour i'm DL'ing at 50kb/s which is good enough for me
,dr_whoopass,2007-12-31T02:35Z,I'll keep seeding at 300k for another few hours but then some others better step up
,axegrinder87,2007-12-31T04:20Z,"i apologize ekbworldwide, i didnt mean to anit-semetic, but come on, this is bs.

nonetheless, a big thanks to the uploader and generous seeders such as dr_whoopass"
,axegrinder87,2007-12-31T04:22Z,"dr_whoopass, how did you play this on xbox360? is it modded, cause as far as i know the 360 wont play avi, and im not calling you a lier btw, but i am very intriqued"
,slippery1,2007-12-31T05:03Z,axe grinder-- download the program DVDsanta (free i believe) and you can combine/convert .avi's into DVD's that will play on any machines.. it is very easy to use  
,slippery1,2007-12-31T05:10Z,an i gave u that advice even after ur ethnic slur toward my people 
,bird113,2007-12-31T06:07Z,c'mon people i have been waiting for this for a long time can we please get some seeders please 
,chronicpayne,2007-12-31T06:22Z,"this is a very poor quality rip, honestly the worst quality UFC match i have watched in about 5 years of downloading them. gg"
,chronicpayne,2007-12-31T06:23Z,"even the sound is not great.

video 5/10
audio 7/10"
,chronicpayne,2007-12-31T06:29Z,"if you havent downloaded this already, wait for another rip imo"
,dr_whoopass,2007-12-31T06:51Z,"Funny I thought the quality was OK, but this is my first download of a UFC in .avi. And axe, 360 can now play xvid and divx thru USB HD, burned disc, and streaming with windows media or connect360. "
,mudking101,2007-12-31T07:00Z,i seed at full speed all day tomorrow if a few seeders will step up for a couple of hours
,laponist,2007-12-31T07:03Z,"happy fucking new year fight lovers.....

Remember to beat the bitch if sheÂ´s hiding the remote"
,Dick Jerkins,2007-12-31T07:20Z,chronicpayne may be Dana White in disguise.
,Dick Jerkins,2007-12-31T07:32Z,"The video and sound are 9+
I used VSO."
,chronicpayne,2007-12-31T08:00Z,"lol ok. maybe i was harsh with 5, but if you can seriously rate this a 9 you have some loooow fucking standards.
 even just now just quickly watching my copies of ufc 77 &78 (both aaf rips as well..) the quality is much much better, and it feels like cotton veil was lifted.

this is a 6 for video TOPS, the sound i really could care less about. "
,chronicpayne,2007-12-31T08:01Z,"and i would never shave my head bald, wtf seriously.. if your bald you better juts have had an almost life threatening dose of radiation otherwise your a faggot."
,axegrinder87,2007-12-31T08:27Z,"well first off let me say that i have downloaded many fights, and this was no less quality than any ive gotten. also keep in mind that i just watched it on my 60"", which makes everything less than hd look like pure shit, but it was fine.

2nd i wanna say that again i apologize for my first comment, i meant no harm in it, just the stupid american coming out in me. and thank you slippery, but i was asking about the 360s ability to play avi formats, as originally microshit wouldnt support its playback of anything other than bullshit mpegs.

3rd, i am so fucking ecstatic in learning that 360 can now play divx and xvid, so thank you so much whoopass, you have truly made my day"
,axegrinder87,2007-12-31T08:38Z,"one last thing, thanks to all the seeders for not giving away the outcome of the fights. 
i watch about 90% of ufc events live on ppv, but the ones i cant catch, i get here, and it pisses me off when i read the comments for verification of either the quality or authenticity of the upload, and some jackoff runs his/her mouth about the outcome of a particular fight.
so thank you all for not being those jackoffs, and remember to try and support the growth of the ufc by at least occasionally ordering a ppv.

and i think dana looks better bald"
,10deeplarger,2007-12-31T12:40Z,the quality of this rip to the 1.47GiB version is incomparable i'd rate this at least an 8 for video and sound ... took almost 18 hours but still thanks a lot hossahot 
,slippery1,2007-12-31T13:51Z,"im seeding at 300kb/s

yeah i agree wit axe about the quality .. i'm gonna watch on a smaller tv and it'll look good.. it's only 1.37gb so you cant expect HD or for it to look great on anything above 36 inches 

thanks again for the upload ,  talk to u all next time another UFC drops.. holla "
,Claudinho69,2007-12-31T14:41Z,"Been looking forward to this, finally a great fight card.
Big thanks to hossahot, and all seeders!"
,OleKristoffer,2007-12-31T16:23Z,"Guys tell me, how is the quality?

I downloaded the ufc 79 from torrentspy whole night, and the quality on that was unbeliveable bad. 

So now I'm downlaoding this for tomorrow. So, any hints?"
,chivas2x,2007-12-31T17:54Z,Great Fights...Good Quality...seeding..:)
,laponist,2007-12-31T18:37Z,"3912 seeders and 7kbh

,MehdiSara,2007-12-31T18:52Z,"Tanx loader, I'am happy. 
And Happy new year."
,nathanielmatthias,2007-12-31T19:50Z,thanks but the quality is no good but i look in t4 sport yesterday so iÂ´m happy
,uhexed,2007-12-31T20:12Z,I'm clearly a idiot and not very skilled at this. I've opened the file but all I've got is the audio file. How do you get the video? I unzipped it... It made the little DVD icon and whenever I open it with Windows Media Player or Nero all I'm getting is the audio that is it. I had this same problem with 78 and just gave up. Help anyone?
,Lugubrizione,2008-01-01T06:21Z,"http://www.videolan.org/

...the best video player, and it is free! :)"
,laponist,2008-01-01T11:58Z,seed please
,slippery1,2008-01-02T22:34Z,"uhexed : try downloading DIVX player , it will give you a lot more video codecs... you should be able to play it after you install it... if that doesn't work , try installing other video codec packs.. but DIVX should take care of it "
,slippery1,2008-01-02T22:37Z,"PS-- the quality of this is 480i/p .. it is ripped from digital cable quality it is not 'HDTV' , but I'm not complaining, it's free and it was posted immediately after the fight so I'm very gratefull.. just watch on a smaller tv , or watch on your bigscreen and STFU "
,Dick Jerkins,2008-01-05T00:50Z,The Bryte are cool. I too have a band - perhaps you've heard of Dick Jerkins and The Spreading Cankers? We're a metal band. We ain't got no website.
,syfer42,2008-01-14T05:34Z,Please Seed!!!
,Faldune,2008-02-28T06:01Z,"Hey you guys, my download speed completely sucks, but I've heard that you need to open a port or something to make the download speed faster???? How do I go abouts doing this??? Can anyone help PLEASE!!!

BTW....my OS is Windows XP Home Edition."
