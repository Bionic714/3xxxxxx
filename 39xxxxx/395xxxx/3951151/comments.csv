This uploader clearly lacks musical knowledge from which decade he's uploading. If you also remove the songs from Rod Stewart and Rolling Stones ('Angie' an 80ies-song, my God!!!!) you've got a half decent collection of 80ies stuff, but missing most of the gems. Look at the actual songs in this torrent before downloading it."

Why, whenever anyone posts an 80s compilation, there's always a smartass to come along and post a comment about how so-and-so song was actually released in 1979, or 1993, or how DARE they make an 80s collection without  in it?

If you want it, download it. If not, don't. But DON'T be a pedant and DON'T be an ungrateful ass."
