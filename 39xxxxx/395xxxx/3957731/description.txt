 BBC - Stalin and The Betrayal of Leningrad

 On the night of October 1, 1950, five high-ranking Soviet Communist
Party officials who led the city of Leningrad through its tragic
wartime siege, were marched out into the cold night and executed.

The death of the leaders under Stalin's direct orders, was part of a
witchhunt that started three years after the war ended and became
known as the "Leningrad Affair".

Based on a series of bizarre allegations, Stalin executed not only
the city's senior party leaders but purged the whole city from the
top down. More than 2000 Leningraders were arrested and fantastic
efforts were made to conceal historic records of events in Leningrad
during the siege.

Stalin And The Betrayal of Leningrad features documents stored in
Stalin's personal archive for 60 years. They reveal the post-war
paranoia that led him to take the brutal steps against those who won
the war for him. Stalin feared they were a danger to his power and
that the war lessened the mass Soviet belief in his central
leadership.

Stalin and Betrayal of Leningrad also tells the real story of the 900
days under German siege, when more than one and a quarter million
Leningraders perished. It features interviews with the last survivors
of the siege, documents and original film material from the period.
