,stinger839,2007-12-29T06:20Z,"thx to the poster for this classic!

some Trivia:
-(for those of you who don't know Italian) ""The Mask of Satan"" was Bava's original title choice, but this was too fierce a title for some audiences (e.g. UK)
-""Black Sunday"" is not to be confused with another Bava flick ""Black Sabbath""
-the film is a favorite of Tim Burton's, who has said it's something he'd like to remake"

Although I wish it had the original Italian dub, this is one of the best dub syncs I have ever heard!"

,nhughes5,2012-01-27T15:33Z,"Don't know if it is dubbed but it is either in Spanish or Italian, not in English as stated by poster. It does have English sub-titles though. Nice clear rip for movie being so old. A10/V10"
,nhughes5,2012-01-27T15:36Z,oops. Sorry for my previous post. I had downloaded this same video from 2 different torrent sites. That review was for the other. Bygones...
