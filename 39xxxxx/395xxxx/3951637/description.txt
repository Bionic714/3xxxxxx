Black Sunday (Italian title: La maschera del demonio) is a 1960 Italian horror film directed by Mario Bava, from a screenplay by Ennio de Concini and Mario Serandrei. The film stars Barbara Steele, John Richardson, Arturo Dominici, and Ivo Garrani. It was Bava\\\\\\\'s directorial debut, although he had helped direct several previous feature films without credit. Based very loosely on Nikolai GogolÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â¢Ã?Â¯Ã?Â¿Ã?Â½Ã?Â¯Ã?Â¿Ã?Â½s short story \\\\\\\"Viy\\\\\\\", the narrative concerns a vampire-witch who is put to death by her own brother, only to return 200 years later to feed off of her descendants.

The movie was considered unusually gruesome by early 1960s standards and was banned in the UK until 1968 due to its violent content. In the U.S., some of the film\\\\\\\'s more gory moments were censored by American International Pictures prior to its theatrical release. Despite its minor censorship problems, the film was a worldwide critical and boxoffice hit, and helped initiate successful careers for both Bava and star Steele.
