FR33DOM TOOL Presents: THE WITCHER Censorship Fix.
################################################################################
The Witcher is a brilliant RPG game that takes player back to the RPG roots,
with it?s cool storyline. At the same time it shows few fresh features that
you haven?t seen in RPG game so far, like it?s combat system.
The setting is based on books by most famous Polish fantasy writer, Andrzej
Sapkowski. And yes ? it?s a Polish game, made by CD Projekt RED. Quite a nice
start for a debut title!
################################################################################
Case: American?s rating board (ESRB) wanted the game to be free of all nudity,
thus making it the only censored version worldwide (excluding Chinese one).
Oh well, you had to say goodbye to all nipples and pubes etc. Until now!
This little nifty patch brings all the naked chicks into your US version of
The Witcher. As seen in EU version of the game. I just took the nudity out of
EU version and put it in here.
################################################################################
Installation: Just run TWCFSetup.exe and it should find and patch your game
automatically.
################################################################################
NOTES:
- you need to have the game installed before running this patch :)
- I only tested this candy on my computer ? I don?t support it!
- you cannot uninstall this patch ? reinstall the game to get rid of nudity
- if your mom grounds you for this, don?t blame me ? this game is rated M!
################################################################################
Message: I?m no cracker, no hacker, and no fucker. I love freedom as much as I
hate censorship. US is as good country as any other and does not deserve to be
treated like retards.

,freedom-tool,2008-01-04T20:57Z,regarding that ascii art - it's quote from NFO file included inside torrent. the ascii art is there :)
,A737,2008-01-05T01:21Z,Has anyone tried this one with the T3RROR version patched to 1.2?
,AnarchyX6942,2008-01-09T08:58Z,What version of the game is this for? All?
,Nyson,2008-01-09T20:54Z,US got a Bush and a Dick in the White House and complains about nudity in games? What a silly country. 
,Matri,2008-01-10T08:29Z,is it possible to get a non-EXE version?
,Callistox87,2008-01-10T17:19Z,I have The Witcher version 1.2; WILL THIS FIX WORK?
,mikeums,2008-01-14T02:50Z,"installed fine but doesn't appear to do anything.
when i have sex with the girls, it still just shows one image of the girl covering herself with a blanket, smiling. just like the original version of the game. weak. i have version 1.2"
,swalker23,2008-01-17T02:11Z,I scanned the file with McAFee and no trojans/viruses found.  I'm just starting the game so don't know if it actually works.  If you kinda worried about this file make a system restore point.
,Maniacle,2008-01-23T04:55Z,"I don't see any changes. The little card in the front shows nudity which i don't think they did before, but the backdrop is still going to be the same.

So if your looking for a porn movie, go download one. :P"
,asdaa1,2008-01-28T23:23Z,"This works on dopeman version too, i have version 1.2.
Yeah, it only removes the bras from dryads and the cards show boobs. 
And the sex scene IS supposed to be like that, as in totally pointless.
And the first woman you do will always be under a blanket with a pussy cat near feet. :D"
,Sunagwa,2008-02-28T00:57Z," Does this add ""swearing"" as well?

 Censorship is suck a fucking drag..."
,Rumour,2008-08-01T00:59Z,"GOOD NEWS PEOPLE!!

THERE IS NO NEED TO INSTALL DAEMONS TOOLS TO PLAY THE WITCHER TO GET AROUND THE TAGES PROTECTION SYSTEM.

The story goes like this I've played about a quarter of the way through The Witcher on an older computer using Daemon Tools Advanced and decided it was time to get a more powerful games system. 

The problem was my new computer (probably the OEM installed drivers) refuses to play with the latest DTA. My system hangs when it is installed (the STPD problem) and I can't even get to the desktop unless I uninstall DTA in safemode.

Woe me ...woe me I will never get to finish the Witcher. Damn, and it was good too. I tried everything to try and get DTA to work but to no avail (and I know my situation is not unique- just google Daemon tools+system hangs, among other problems). Soon the Witcher was becoming a distant memory...a happy memory.

That was until I updated my copy of UltraISO to ""UltraISO Premium Edition version 9.3.0.2600"". I know for a fact that my older 9.1 version could not play it in its one virtual drive (I think it was more designed for playing DVD.iso's than getting around games protections).

I was able to install The Witcher to my hard drive (load the .iso into the virtual drive and press the magnifying glass symbol by the side to autoplay The Witcher.iso). I then updated it to v1.2 patch and replaced the witcher.exe with a no-cd crack.  

I have no idea why it was able to work as UltraISO is not a dedicated games .iso emulator like DTA. BUT IT WORKS...DAMN IT...IT WORKS.

No more DTA for me. In contrast UltraISO is non-invasive on your system and I've had no incompatibility problems or issues with it at all.

NOTE: I'm not sure if Witcher.mdf format works with this program so play it safe and use a rip that is a Witcher.iso. I downloaded this copy of UltraISO with a serial no. You can get it anywhere on the web: most torrents. 

I won't divulge the exact site simply because there are some silly fuckers out there who think it's a great idea to start forum threads with good sites names posted all over it. Over exposing good non-torrent sites and getting them shut down in the process. 

Hail me for I am the new King...long live the KING...long live the King!.

BTW I got my version of The Witcher from

(just for reference)

I will spam the other Witcher torrents here to spread the good news."
