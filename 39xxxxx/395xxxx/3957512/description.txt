*** JUST WHAT IS THIS TORRENT? ***
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Some folks seem to think that my NFO\'s are a bit vague, so here is the lowdown 
on this DVD. It\'s a fan edit of the second Halloween movie in which the made for 
television scenes re-edited back into the theatrical version of the film.  


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** FEATURED PRESERVATION ***
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


HALLOWEEN II: The Ultimate Cut - A Fan Edit

Sadly, the editor is unknown and this DVD was created from a VHS of this edit. I 
do not take claim for the edit only the VHS2DVD transfer.

Picking up right where the first film ended, this sequel begins as Doctor Loomis 
pumps the evil Michael Myers full of lead, then watches helplessly as the maniac 
killer stands up again and runs away. Laurie Strode, the teenager terrorized by 
Myers is taken to a nearby hospital to recover from her traumatic ordeal. But 
Myers isnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t thought with her yet, and the fright-night monster works his way 
through the sleepy town leaving a river of blood in his wake. Determined to get 
his revenge on Laurie, he eventually descends upon the hospital - and the dark 
secret that binds the two of them is finally revealed. 

This once obscure fan created film edit is the theatrical version of the film 
with the made for television scenes edited into it so you get the gore you donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t 
see in the TV version and the added scenes you donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t get in the theatrical 
version.
