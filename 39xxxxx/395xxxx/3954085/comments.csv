[T],_Maelstrom_,2008-01-14T20:26Z,"paulauster47, I do not know if it works on a Mac but I normally use the Subresync function in the popular VobSub program. It is a bit time consuming though because you have to enter a value for each letter, it's capitalized version, punctuation and numbers. I doubt I would do a good job with French but if you have 15 minutes and a bit of patience you should be ok."
[T],_Maelstrom_,2008-01-14T21:15Z,"I should also mention you could also get a player that decodes vob/idx subtitles and works on a Mac , like VLC (http://www.videolan.org/vlc)."
,paulauster47,2008-01-15T07:04Z,"Hi maelstrom, my problem is for listen on my TV..

,Smash_TV,2009-02-09T03:37Z,"Might I ask what the purpose of splitting the film in two is? And more importantly, what program can unite them into one file?"
,grandpoisson,2009-04-12T14:55Z,"the point is that you can brun it 2 cd's.... to watch in you divx compatible dvd player.

dont worry, since cd's will cease to exist in a few years and we will only use dvd's this wont happen long anymore ....:)"
,maini4ka,2009-08-07T11:14Z,"_Maelstrom_, many thanks for your efforts.

For Mac Users: to convert [text] .sub files to .srt use the freeware app Sub2Srt.  It won't work with .idx/.sub files though."
