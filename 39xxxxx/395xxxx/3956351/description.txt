Publisher's Summary

Beloved by readers, Sophie Kinsella's national best seller, Confessions of a Shopaholic, introduced the 

irrepressible one-woman shopping phenomenon, Becky Bloomwood. Now, in this hilarious follow-up, Becky and her 

credit cards are headed across the Atlantic.

With her shopping excesses (somewhat) in check and her career as a TV financial guru thriving, Becky's biggest 

problem seems to be tearing her entrepreneur boyfriend, Luke, away from work for a romantic country weekend. And 

worse, figuring out how to "pack light." But packing takes on a whole new meaning when Luke announces he's moving 

to New York for business - and he asks Becky to go with him!

Before you can say "Prada sample sale," Becky has landed in the Big Apple, home of Park Avenue penthouses and 

luxury department stores.

Surely it's only a matter of time until she becomes an American TV celebrity, and she and Luke are the toast of 

Gotham society. Nothing can stand in their way, especially with Becky's bills miles away in London.
