The Invasion.SweSub(2007)

crashed space shuttle brings a form of bacteria to earth that becomes catalysed during r.e.m sleep, and turns the infected host into an emotionless human. A psychiatrist from New York becomes infected whilst trying to find her son, and therefore must not fall asleep lest she become like them. She and her current boyfriend discover that one of her patients and her son are immune to the virus, due to a severe strain of chicken pox they had in a previous year, and so they fight their way into a quarantined area where they are subjected to testing, and a year later almost all infectees are normal again.
