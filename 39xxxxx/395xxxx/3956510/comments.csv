,illumi405,2008-05-13T08:23Z,Are the Clan War and Four Winds Saga novels included in this package?
,woozy8,2008-05-13T20:22Z,"If you click the number next to where it says Files at the top, it will give you a full file listing beneath 'download this torrent'.

It looks like it is roleplay only, no novels."

Sorry, as noted by woozy8, this is RPG materials only.  That said, there are some interesting compliments to the novels in the various sourcebooks, given that the tone is of a non-fiction work as opposed to a story."
