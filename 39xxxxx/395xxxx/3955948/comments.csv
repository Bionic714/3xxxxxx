,raziel1313,2008-01-19T07:33Z,how do you access the mkv file? when I try to play it in videolan there is only one episode. this there a way to split them up into the full series? thanks
,crotchxpheasantx,2008-02-28T05:03Z,"the subtitles are cut off, at least for episode 15.  video quality is good, but translation qual is really poor."
,unholytiger,2008-04-21T05:37Z,Any news on the subtitles? Because I would really like to watch episode 15 now.
,Veritias,2008-04-29T20:23Z,"In order to access .mkv files you need CCCP + MPC.

Anyways thanks for upload!"
,arestice,2008-05-10T22:49Z,The Bullet Speed Subs episodes aren't as good as Order. I guess it's possible it's my PC but audio often lags off of the subtitles. 
,olufmcdude,2008-05-29T02:45Z,"Quicktime says that all the .MP4 episodes need a sampling description or something along those lines. I can swear it's just Apple acting up, any suggestions for a different player? Also, from the ones I can watch, it looks great. Thanks heaps."
,olufmcdude,2008-05-29T03:18Z,"Sorry, disregard that. In case anyone encounters the same problem, try converting the video files to, for example, .avi."
,valiar,2008-06-08T11:15Z,"You can play .mkv (matroska video) files, as well as just about any others, easily in VLC, which you can get free here:

,KovBoj,2008-08-04T23:13Z,"DEWDS!!
I really need subs for those episodes from #15!!!"
,deception01,2008-08-12T07:02Z,"Hey,

Can a couple of people who have these files completed seed them?  The tracker shows 160 seeders but only 2-3 people seed them at 8kb/s max.  

Thanx"
,RichSpoon,2008-08-16T08:13Z,"For those who can't see the subs download GOM player at: http://www.gomlab.com/eng/GMP_download.html The first time it will ask you to download a codec (which it automatically finds, so no searching!) Then it will work fine. 
PS, GOM player is the VERY best player to watch movies anime and other video's"
,Matterman,2008-08-26T16:00Z,actually for mkvs you want to use the CCCP that contains Media Player Classic. SEED please!
,Vercious,2008-09-11T22:28Z,"Are these the Japanese DVD versions of the episodes, or just the HD TV versions?"
,hpdarkman525,2008-09-17T06:28Z,"@Vercious

While I'm not 100% sure, judging from the facts that there are multiple formats and subbers used and that at the beginning of at least the first episode, the ??????? stuff appears at the bottom, I would guess it's the HD TV versions"
,vics666,2008-09-27T04:29Z,"I tried all players and codecs that suport matroska, but I just cant play episode 15 or any of the othe .mkv. Im the only one whos having that kind of problem?"
,laxflip,2008-10-29T07:17Z,"man i can play all the episodes and everything in VLC but all of a sudden episode 15 doesnt have subs??? thats kinda wack ill see whast plausible from some of the other comments and if i find a way to either get the ""hidden"" subs to show or find better subs ill let yall know this is some bullshit"
,laxflip,2008-10-29T07:24Z,gentleman i figured it out..... VLC you have to turn the sub track on for episodes 15-27... the subs are included they just arent part of the video if u get what i mean. I.e. 1-10 the subs were acually on the video itself while 15-27 they are seperate. In VLC got to video then subtitles track and you should see 1 english select and enjoy.. sadly the damn subtitles are like way off the screen so good luck i for one dont give a fuck cuz this anime is owning my mind right now enjoy kiddies
,laxflip,2008-10-29T07:30Z,"i fixed the bullshit with the text being fucking GIANTIC also.. in VLC go to settings>preferences

then expand the video section click expand subtitles  click text renderer shoudl be the first option select text size to smallest sadly because the orginal size of these is for hd quality if ur comp or lappy cant go to that size you can sacrifice size for a clearer better picture and having the words easy to read by clicking video>zoom>half

my work is done here now to enjoy the last set of episodes"
,laxflip,2008-10-29T07:41Z,"ok fuck it half the fucking subs in episode 15 are way the fuck out off the screen... fucking shitty subs... i got tired of the bullshit so here

^^^^subbed decently for your viewing pleasure and actually visible for the whole screen not just like choppin off half the damn sub^^^^^

,xoddx,2008-11-09T04:47Z,Worth the download?
,baka316,2008-11-14T09:56Z,"Great upload sir, the quality is fantastic, definitely worth my bandwidth & hard drive space, highly recommended you watch this masterpiece of a series."
,Spartan745,2008-12-13T20:08Z,Does anyone know where I can get subs for episode 23? all it has is the lulz subs. It's getting really annoying how I've just spent half an hour looking for sub files. 
,sschtauffen,2009-01-19T00:56Z,"Hey what the fuck is with subs in Epi 15, you fuckin jokers? "
,natsanugi,2009-01-24T04:21Z,"sschtauffen, howabout learning to read sometime? There are many posts above that say how to enable the subtitles. Since they are mkv files, they use subtitles almost exactly like your dvd, so the program puts the words in at runtime.

Since you probably won't read it anyway....

JUST DOWNLOAD VLC MEDIA PLAYER
http://www.videolan.org/
IT RUNS NEARLY EVERY TYPE OF VIDEO

I'm not saying it's the best, but it works well, it's free, and so far it's run everything I've put into it without having to dl any codecs. 
To get the subtitles, just right click the video while it's playing, go to video, subtitles, and select english.

Now, was that hard???"
,starsauce,2009-03-12T09:29Z,"Well my VLC won't play the subs at all even though they are selected but as RichSpoon suggested i downloaded GOM and it works perfectly, subs look great, really liking this media player."
,slizer454,2009-03-20T08:47Z,"FOUND IT!!!!!!!!!

okay i have solved this issue with a VERY lucky find, just like Matterman said before, you have to download the CCCP codec pack. now this isnt just a codec pack, when you download it you will want to install it along with the zoom player, and after the installation is done, you can view the video through the zoom player and the subtitles are corrected and put in its original spot.

Cheers!"
,hachibukai,2009-03-20T18:41Z,"No matter what you need CCCP codecs, unless you use VLC which needs no codecs(but not my preference) Zoom works really well for most but not all! My all time favorite that works 100% of the time and has best features is GOM player(you can fix any subs that are off in timing, and completely edit the subs size, color, timing, font etc!!!) For me Gom always works BEST!(as long as you DO have CCCP codecs!)"
,velveetaavenger,2009-03-25T03:56Z,Is there any reason why order didn't finish the entire series? BSS-Anon has entire lines dropped out of their subs.
,killa132004,2009-06-02T05:08Z,"The best of all media players for anime, and any type of movie or flash is The KMplayer its a nice proprietary freeware that can play any format, dual audio, subtitles surround sound, optical out all, haven't found anything like it so many options too."
,ashfromevildead,2009-06-24T23:52Z,"Order (I.E. Black-Order) eventually subbed the episodes 1-19

,Vhan8765,2011-09-06T03:22Z,"I have a major problem. I downloaded this and was going to watch it on my Xbox360. The .mkv files didn't work on my 360, so I converted them to .avi. I then checked them to see if they all worked, they did, so I deleted all the originals. When rechecking them I noticed episodes 15-27 didn't have subtitles. I came back to this page to see if others had the same problem. I figured out that all I had to do was turn on the subtitles. That didn't work, so I'm assuming that the subtitle files were deleted while converting the files. So now I have 13 episodes without subtitles. Can somebody help me please?"
