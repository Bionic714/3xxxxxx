Unlike many of the numerous Dolly Parton hits collections, 16 BIGGEST HITS covers the entirely of the diminutive powerhouse's career instead of focusing solely on her early traditional country material or her later slick pop hits. Here, "Jolene" and "Coat of Many Colors" sit comfortably next to "9 To 5" and "Islands in the Stream." A budget line compilation with fine sound but minimal packaging, this is a nice one-stop beginning for newcomers looking only for the biggest singles.
