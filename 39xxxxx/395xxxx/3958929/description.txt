Midsomer Murders
60. Shot at Dawn   
First aired: 1/1/2008 in the UK

Take your pick about how you number this episode - none of the guides on the Net make any sense IMHO - even the Wikipedia guide has gone off. This is the 60th available episode with the pilot as 01 and including bit torrent. Conceivably this episode could be S10E07, S10E09, S11E01,S11E02 or (and even more bizarre) S12E01, but who cares? Enjoy!

Synopsis (www.tv.com):

A 90-year-old feud comes to a head when the name of a soldier shot for cowardice after the 

Somme is added to the war memorial at Midsomer Parva. A retired colonel is shot dead, and Barnaby and Jones discover dangerous secrets connecting two families.
