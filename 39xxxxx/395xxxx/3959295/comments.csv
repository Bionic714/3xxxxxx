,u_vant_i,2009-08-10T04:40Z,Please Please Seed. This ones taken a long time and now I'm stuck on 90%.  Thanks 
,u_vant_i,2009-08-13T19:42Z,"Thanks, to who ever is seeding!!!  - it's not showing seeds here but it started trickling down again at my end with two seeds. "
,Felicienne,2010-01-26T05:41Z,"dohduhdah - Thank you for your efforts and the great download speed.
However it would be nice to know that the list of pictures is arranged by the first names of the artists. I was never on the first name basis with them. LOL
Also some are lumped under the name of their country and not identified.
Probably this list belongs to a search engine, not included.
If you could define all of your gifts to us, we would appreciate.
Thanks again,
Felicienne"
,Pilanus,2010-01-29T22:11Z,The only way this torrent could be better is if the names of the pieces were provided.
