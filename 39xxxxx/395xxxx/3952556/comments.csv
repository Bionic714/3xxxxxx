,Ianp,2008-01-09T01:23Z,"crook file, re downloaded, works fine. Thanks Gomez12"
,fivekitten,2008-02-22T23:32Z,"Thanks Gomez! Downloaded smooth, rar files opened with no problems, I registered and got a confirming email.  I don't really know what thinstall is, but the thinstall directory has to do with registration. Thanks for your time! Just started the program, but looks like it's working fine! Everything went through my Avast virus scanner. "
,fivekitten,2008-02-23T01:26Z,Think I spoke too soon. sniff. sniff. Tried to open a blank new file and it couldn't find a .dll file...tried moving directories around to match cause I know netobjects is very sensitive to directory placement...deleting and starting over..but I don't see a lot of the program files? (yes i have my system files on view.) Help?
,fivekitten,2008-02-23T01:48Z,"Just wanted to add: www_thinstall_com for inquiring minds.  Just google, on youtube too. "
,fivekitten,2008-02-23T07:57Z,"Don't mean to be a comment hog. But I've been working on this all day and can't get it to work. Tried updating when it suggested (which made it start loading then just kept on loading and filled my cpu), tried turning computer on and off, looking for missing files. If I'm supposed to do something ""special"" or if I'm missing a step or anyone can help me in any way I'd really appreciate it.  fivekitten ZZ yahoo (substitute at for ZZ and add the dot com to yahoo).

Thanks for any help!"
