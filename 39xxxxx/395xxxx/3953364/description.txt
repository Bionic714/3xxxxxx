Description

Wolfenstein Enemy Territory is an online multiplayer game, where the players interact with each other over a network in two teams (Axis and Allies) to defend or destroy mission objectives. The game is playable over the Internet or a Local Area Network. Like many online games, cheating and exploit communities exist. To counter this, the game has support for PunkBuster, an anti-cheat solution.
