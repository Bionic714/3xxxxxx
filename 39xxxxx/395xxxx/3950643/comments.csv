This torrent has been stuck at 95.9% for a long time and unavailable elsewhere.....UNTIL I discovered the files being shared as Discovery Channel drivel and copied them here.

For the unenlightened, Discovery Channel is background noise for children.  Adolescents graduate to PBS or BBC.  Adults get by on The History Channel.

This series was produced by the BBC around 1994 which was during an era when the BBC fed the intellects of the free world.  There even came a time when Tony Blair was its leader.

This series is the pinnacle of documentaries putting ""The World at War"" into second place.  It is almost completely factual, overflowing with archival footage, less repetitious, and nearly devoid of hype.  In short, it is nothing like Discovery Channel and even better than The History Channel.

Probably, we should collect the 30 or so files and put them under a meaningful name. "

Discovery channel was much better five or ten years ago before they split it up and moved the good stuff off to make room for mechanics shows."
