,ronin1011,2008-01-07T11:27Z,Good Stuff! Thanks. So the 1.2 patch works now? And do I install it after this English fix?
,lacheflausat,2008-01-14T00:47Z,"Works (everithing : subtitle, menu, voices) anly if u use patch after the englis fix but anly till chapter 2 Wen chapter 2 starts the subtitles are, but no voices.This is a bug that can be fixed or is becouse the voices file is from demo ?"
,naix88,2008-02-04T17:37Z,i'm also facing the same problem. i've done all the instruction given and patched 1.2
,Leon_cze,2008-02-28T19:52Z,"same problem asa lacheflausat, no voices from chapter 2 (some voices form chapter 1 there are, but only civilians....) So i guess, the only way to make it work, is to buy the original game :-(...damn"

,zee123,2008-06-28T17:29Z,I dont understand Number 2. When you say registry you mean the instal directory right? if that is what you mean i still cant find HKEY LOCAL MACHINE

,zee123,2008-06-28T23:00Z,"when i right click on the language file there is no ""merge option"""
