Poem by: A.B. 'Banjo' Paterson (1864-1941)

"The Man From Snowy River" is a poem by Australian bush poet Banjo Paterson. It was first published in The Bulletin, an Australian news magazine, in April 1890.

The poem tells the story of a horseback pursuit to recapture the colt of a prizewinning racehorse that escaped from its paddock and is living wild with the brumbies (wild horses) of the mountain ranges. Eventually the brumbies descend a seemingly impassably steep slope, at which point the assembled riders give up the pursuit, except the young hero, who spurs his pony down the "terrible descent" to catch the mob.


The Man from Snowy River (1982)

The story of a boy suddenly alone in the world. The men who challenge him. And the girl who helps him become a man. 
Jim Craig has lived his first 18 years in the mountains of Australia on his father's farm. The death of his father forces him to go to the low lands to earn enough money to get the farm back on its feet. Kirk Douglas plays two roles as twin brothers who haven't spoken for years, one of whom was Jim's father's best friend and the other of whom is the father of the girl he wants to marry. A 20 year old feud re-erupts, catching Jim and Jessica in the middle of it as Jim is accused of letting a prize stallion loose. He rides off with the crack riders to bring it back, back into the mountains where he was raised. Jim goes out with them because of the regard in which his father was held, and comes back having earned his own respect.

The Man from Snowy River II (1988)
aka `Return to Snowy River'

Young Jim Craig returns to the Australian high country, after being away herding the horses he caught and sold, in order to provide a stake for his future. He finds things quite different than when he left: his girlfriend, Jessica Harrison, is being pursued by a rich suitor, Jessica's father wants him out of her life, and the residents of the high country are being driven out by the wealthier low country ranchers. Jim definitely has his work cut out for him.

A Favorite, 4 September 2004
Author: from Lanham, Maryland 

The Man from Snowy River is a family favorite. The cinematography of this film was breath-taking. The love story was convincing and the acting was superb. Kirk Douglas plays both the father and the brother and although the plot is somewhat contrived, it is set up extremely well. All of the elements work to make a good movie and one that I watch over and over. The scenes of the Australian mountains and the horses along with the musical score make this a very picturesque, romantic, and warm film. A romance and an action-adventure movie rolled into one which can charm a woman and still be a manly film. The 2nd movie Return to Snowy River was a worthy sequel and Tom Burlinson as Jim Craig does an excellent job in both films...I would definitely recommend this film.
