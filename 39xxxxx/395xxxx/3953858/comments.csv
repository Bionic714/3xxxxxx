,antamony,2007-12-31T02:49Z,"Thanks for this. I've tried WinZip, WinRAR, Stuffit, 7zip, tGzip, repair options and dunno what else, but cannot unpack the zipped version of kalyway. The completed file is fine, it's the damned OS X zip method.

And that was the same problem many had with the kalyway 9a527 release as well.

Frankly, considering that it was made as an ISO - knowing that it is to be installed on a PC, but zipping it in a way that seems only accessible under OS X makes me think the ""kalyway"" folks are kind of perverse.

Oh well. I really have no right to complain.

,piratenanker,2008-03-06T17:47Z,"have downloades the zip-Version and problems to UNZIP? 
I had them, too, because it's compressed with some Mac SW and WinRAR can't unpack. It works with StuffIt, also available for Win; a trial version you find to download:
http://www.pctipp.ch/downloads/betriebssystem/14204/stuffit_expander_stuffit_standard_edition.html
so you get the iso at least."

Is this configuration ok to install the Mac?

Wat is this SSE2 and SSE3 CPUS??
Please respond any one of u guys... "
,ArcaynE,2008-04-18T21:02Z,"ok, to find out if it is SSE2 or SSE3, search google for CPU-Z.  Download it, and run it, and when it loads, it will tell you under CPU capabilities, or something similar.

For those that are asking, this is the ISO version of the torrent, so just download, burn, and install.

,sal4020,2009-11-03T06:54Z,Hey guys i need help every time i go to install darwin it just keeps restarting and i cant figure it out. some help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance 
,The-Blob,2010-01-02T01:19Z,"Thanks for the upload! Installed just fine! However, I've run into one problem. I have to have the DVD in the drive for Mac to boot up. If I take it out and try to boot I get a b/o error. Any way around this? Thanks!"
,kajchamajstor,2011-12-11T20:40Z,"I'd appreciate your help.
I have a Asus x51l laptop.
Intel core 2 duo t5750 @ 2.0GHZ
2GB of RAM
Intel GMA965 on board VGA
250GB of HDD

Can you help me in choosing drivers?"
,kajchamajstor,2011-12-12T18:41Z,"OK  HERE  IS  HOW  I  TRYED  INSTALLING  kalyway  10.5.1.
I used power iso to burn kalyway leo 10.5.1 on DVD
I inserted the DVD to my ASUS X51L laptop, and I
restarted my laptop... When it first shows white ASUS letters, you need to press F2 to enter BIOS
Go to BOOT and then go down to boot device priority. Set first boot device to CD/DVD and 2nd to HDD.
Ok save changes and exit BIOS.
Then your computer will restart and it will try to install osx86, by asking you to choose to boot from cd/dvd or to press F8 for additional options.
Since i have ASUS X51L laptop, i had to press F8
and then type cpus=1 (to boot from CD/DVD). I read about ""cpus=1"" on wikipedia (osx86 project or something).
So it starts loading Darwin x86. And then shows Apple screen and keeps loading. Both of these loadings take about 2-3 minutes each.
Then after Apple screen loads, it shows sky blue screen and stops there.
ANYONE  CAN  HELP?,  I'd appreciate it very much.!"
