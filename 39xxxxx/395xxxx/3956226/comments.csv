,n1nj4Lo,2008-03-20T09:35Z,"Uhhmmm can we say HELLO!!! No wonder why antivirus programs pick it up as a threat, Go figure it a webcam hacker... That should be explaination enough but I guess not so for the dullwitted and dinse minded... It's meant to hack and steal a live stream from your buddies webcams without them knowing it, In otherwords its a safe malicious program also a false negative.. So no wonder why do ya think your antivirus would wanna call it a threat, Becauz it is a program that runs illegal actions that it doesn't like... "
