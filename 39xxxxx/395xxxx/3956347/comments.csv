I am not Trent Reznor or affiliated with anyone from the NIN camp.

Some people at ETS asked me to upload this, so I did."
,cheese_procedure,2008-01-01T09:38Z,Thanx for the upload and giving The Fragile a breath of fresh air! If i had to choose a fave album The Fragile would be at the top of the list.
,SeedSum,2008-01-02T07:24Z,"Thanks for the positive comment.

To everybody downloading this, I've seeded to 7.5 and I need to give my computer a break. Don't worry though I will be back on tomorrow at 11AM."
