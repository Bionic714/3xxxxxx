This is my reimagination of the Nine Inch Nails' album, The Fragile. 

It consist of songs from The Fragile, Still and various singles. 

I tried to make it flow as best as I could with Audicity but there's only so much I could do with what I have. I only listed the big changes on the tracklist but almost all of the tracks have been slightly modified in someway (reconstructed beginning/end, silence clipped, fades, etc)

Happy new year!
