,desert873,2008-01-11T22:50Z,"i wanna finnish downloading tht 53gig hentai thing.but i realy want this so don't stop seeding
torrent r the best i got alcohol 120%, photoshop CS3, 3ds max, winAVS converter, and more.... 
they all work!!"
,StuShipp,2008-01-23T02:32Z,Please SEED!
,burftoo,2008-01-25T04:46Z,Thanks for the inuyasha but lovelyst you are bat shit crazy 
,anakin66,2008-01-26T23:22Z,"This is wonderful, lovelyst, but could you seed a little longer so we can get the missing few bits of the files? I haven't actually seen this seeded yet, according to utorrent, despite thepiratebay saying it has one seed. 144 leechers are eagerly waiting :)"
,anakin66,2008-01-28T23:24Z,Seriously? No one is going to seed the last 0.1% so we can finish downloading the files? That's not right.
,anakin66,2008-02-08T00:49Z,"Okay, so I don't know if anyone reads these comments or not, but this torrent has never shown a seed while I've tried downloading it, or gone above 0.999 availability. There is an alternative available on isohunt.com. It is a dual audio compilation (English and Japanese), all mkv files. The shortcut is: http://isohunt.com/download/27315587/inuyasha .

It shouldn't be necessary to post a link to a different site, just so people can finish downloading a very large torrent because a tenth of a percent is missing. If the guy who posted this torrent read the comments, or if piratebay allowed personal messages to the author (giving them the option to block unwanted messages, or only allow certain ones, of course), there would be no need since surely he could have provided the four damaged/missing files. This is pathetic.

I've found similar files on Isohunt, but when I copied them, they just got screwed up by the torrent again. There must be some minor difference. I'm going to take one last attempt, but I'd try the dual audio file."
,anakin66,2008-02-08T01:28Z,"Here is another link to a complete version of this torrent: http://isohunt.com/download/18780227/inuyasha+complete .

Unfortunately, whatever is screwed up in the torrent on this site prevents copying the four missing files from the above torrent. But it will let you download them separately. That's something. I'd still stick with dual audio, instead of this mishmash of file types and languages (all the AVI files are strictly Japanese, by the way)."
,LandraBlaze,2008-03-15T21:16Z,"I have never been able to see the whole anime, and i am at 99.9%. Please seed the last 00.1%! Please!!!"
,LandraBlaze,2008-03-17T00:04Z,"I have no clue what has happened, but its terrible! The last time I posted I was at 99.9%, and now I am suddenly at 1.8%! What went wrong?!?"
,anakin66,2008-03-25T00:03Z,"Landra, I you are using utorrent, I would suggest you manually stop the torrent (stop, not remove) then right click on the torrent and select force recheck. Hopefully, it will come back to where it was. However, this guy never seeds, so you will never get past 99.9% as some of the episodes have pieces missing.

Also, have you tried running the torrents from another site (I suggested one or two). If so, the torrents on the other sites are complete, and not compatible with this one. You may find that you have more than one copy of Inuyasha downloading. Check your download directory and see if Inuyasha appears under different directories.

That's all I can suggest. Unless you accidentally deleted your files, which seems really unlikely, I think you just got a glitch, or else you tried downloading a seeded version and it is going to another directory."
,anakin66,2008-03-25T16:35Z,"By the way, after the recheck is done, you will need to start the torrent running again, sinply by selecting start using the right click function beside the torrent name."
,ch.Kampfaffe,2008-04-01T08:36Z,"@ anakin66 i followed your link on iso hunt. the download is working, but i how do you play ogm files? i'd appreciate any help^^"
,anakin66,2008-04-02T00:10Z,"ogm files simply require codecs to play, like everything else. You'll may need to do a google search for .ogm file codecs. However, I believe the Combined Community Codec Pack at http://www.cccp-project.net/ has the proper codecs. It is free. If it works, you don't need to do a search. I believe k-lite also works with .ogm files.

So what was the problem, anyway? Did something happen to your files and they got deleted, or did you try running a different torrent? Just curious."
,anakin66,2008-04-02T00:12Z,"P.S.

Don't you hate the fact that this board doesn't allow personal messages, or give some secure way for one user to anonymously contact another? Oh well."
,anakin66,2008-04-02T05:41Z,"Sorry ch.Kampfaffe , got you confused with LandraBlaze. Just ignore the part about what happened to your files. By the way, make sure you select the .ogm file to play, and not it's corresponding .ssa file. The .ssa files are subtitles, I believe. If you don't want them, you can just move the files with that extension to a different directory."
,ch.Kampfaffe,2008-04-03T02:45Z,"wow. cool. and yes, i really hate it. this way i didnt even know if i would get an answer...^^ lucky, that u saw it. i'll try that codec pack. thanks"
,ch.Kampfaffe,2008-04-03T02:56Z,"another question. (i feel really stupid^^)

after i downloaded the codec pack, do i have to do anything? because media player classic says it cant render the file."
,ch.Kampfaffe,2008-04-05T03:17Z,"never mind^^ i realized that the vid was damaged, because other ogm files worked just fine."
,anakin66,2008-04-05T23:49Z,"Your luck continues, as I checked again today. After you download either of the two codec packs I suggested, you have to install them. Obviously, if they are in a zipped format, then you first have to unzip them to a temporary directory before installing. There should just be an install.exe or setup.exe file.

Did your file not work because what you downloaded was corrupt, or are you still downloading the file and didn't have enough to run. Most video files will play if a significant amount has been downloaded, even though you should wait until the entire file is done or risk crashing the torrent.

Regardless, if your file was corrupted after being fully downloaded, you could try downloading just that file again, and it wouldn't hurt to install the codec packs. You might find that with the updated codecs, the ogm file will work. In other words the file may not be corrupt, but may have been encoded with a more recent codec.

If you're using something like utorrent, you should have no problem downloading just a single file again instead of the whole file. And while no one ever seeds the torrent provided here, so some of the files are only partially there, the isohunt links I provided earlier are seeded, if slow.

I think one of the liks I provided was dead, but just look for the link to the [AHQ]Inuyasha Complete Dual Audio files when you click on the links. Or go to isohunt.com and do a search. I think I tried some of the MKV files in this torrent(I wish they'd just stick with DivX or Xvid), and they weren't even english audio, just Japanese. I can't understand why it says 138 people continue trying to download this file when they can download a slightly larger (40 GB file) with dual audio that is seeded, and now even a dual audio version with the four movies included from isohunt. They must realize by now that lovelyst doesn't seed this, and several files have missing pieces.

Maybe we're the only ones reading the comments. Ha Ha!!"
,ch.Kampfaffe,2008-04-10T07:33Z,"ok. first: yes, i installed the codecs. actually for all the player i have, in other words: zoom player, Gom player, media classic, and VLC didnt need one. and the files that i downloaded did not work. and the codec are the latest ones, since they came directly from each player's official site. (at least i think that this means that it is the latest^^) 

and then, i found another site (really nice) where you can download InuYasha (dual audio) as well as many other animes. 

you might be right about only us reading the comments. and earlier you said something about some of your vids broken or missing. you (and to anybody else who is actually reading this comment)

(i think you need an account for this - but its all for free...)"
,ch.Kampfaffe,2008-04-10T07:35Z,"oh, by the way, how come that this thing here is turning into a chat between us two?^^"
,anakin66,2008-04-10T23:06Z,"Like I said, I guess no one else bothers reading the comments, and that's why it has become a chat room between us. What's creepier is that I get the urge to check this torrent and it always turns out to be the same day that you post.

Regardless, I am downloading from another torrent, because several of the files, including the finale have missing pieces (utorrent shows you missing blocks if you click on the file and select files from the tabs on the bottom. Plus the files in this torrent aren't all dubbed in English. Many are just Japanese, and I only speak English.

What can I say, we've done all we can to let the others know what the problem is with this torrent. It isn't our fault if they choose not to read our warnings and check the file. Maybe they all have gigantic hard drives and can afford to waste the space and time. I can't.

I'm almost at 80% with the dual audio torrent I've been downloading (from isohunt), plus I already selected and have downloaded the four movies from the other torrent that included them in dual audio format, so it shouldn't be too long now before I'm done.

If only the person who posted this torrent had read it, there wouldn't be 127 downloaders stuck at .999 percent, or whatever it is. Of course, having posted alternate links, we've done our part.

By the way, if you are familiar with and like Eureka Seven, I have it posted on this site at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3950576/Eureka_Seven_Complete_Series_English_Dubbed_[C-W]_Rips . Plus there are megadownload links if you are the impatient kind. I got a lot of Flack originally for not staying online and for uploading so slow, but I've already lost one computer and am not going to lose another, and my IP practices torrent throttling to limit speed. But there are supposedly lots of seeders now, including myself.

And so our chat ends, because this is getting huge. It's been a slice! Good luck!"
,Enki88,2008-06-29T23:41Z,"Stuck at 99.9%. Please seed.

Great torrent. High quality video and one of the best anime series ever. Thanks for the upload."
,Nongulavu,2008-08-06T06:19Z,"anakin66 : Do you know any other simular Torrents to this one, as the last one you posted is ""invalid file ID"" :S

Really hope you can find one ^^"
,ch.Kampfaffe,2008-09-17T16:42Z,"oh man. i didnt think that anybody would comment here anymore. well for those who are stuck at 99.9%. you can download the missing episode(s)  at following link (direct download, register for free)

http://www.anime-eden.com/page/anime/inuyasha/series.html"
,Mr.Ninja,2008-10-26T13:03Z,"For those of you trying to get into Anime Eden with the links thta's been privided here, all you have to do is go here; http://www.anime-eden.com/
The reason why you cannot use the other link, is that you have to be a registrated member to enter that area.
Regarding the last % of this torrent, it's really a shame that most people are stuck with a near complete 34GB torrent, but you can view most of the episodes with VLC player.
Sometimes VLC shuts down due to... ehmmm, whatever, but all you have to do is to drag the timecursor in VLC just a few seconds after the error occurs.
This is a great anime and really worth watching.
Same kind of style as Samurai X, but a really good story with lots of adventure.

Hope lovelyst get's out of jail soon and starts to seed this one again.

Best regards from, Mr.Ninja."

,Rikuvampire,2012-04-04T19:39Z,"Does this torrent complete downloading or it stops at 99% or something like that?

Nevertheless, if it stops at 99%, can i watch any complete episode, or it stops in the middle of the chapter?"
