,newstips,2008-01-03T23:15Z,"Hi,
I tried today but at Mercurius website the Version available is  02.00.26 and the keyloader does not work for this version!
Please upload the setup for 2.00.23 as a new torrent.
Many thanks."
,nobian,2008-01-04T17:14Z,"Hi! I've uploaded it, please search for it!

Thank you. If you can't download it, please write again!"
,newstips,2008-01-05T04:19Z,"Hi,
I removed the 2.00.26 version and installed the .23 version in the new torrent. The keyloader still complains on a Vista system ""Code not found! Please check software version and instructions!"" 
I have tried a fresh 2.00.23 setup on an XP machine too but the same complaint is there! I have even tried to run the keyloader with Admin privilages. I am entering a username and then click OK at which Mercurius complains that the serial is invalid. At this time I hit ""Get Serial"" on the keyloader . I have also tried to close only the  warning message box and not the ""Enter User Name and Serial Number"" dialog. No luck.
Any suggestions?
Thanks"

With the Vista machine here, even in safe mode it is not working."
