[T],PARiSHiLTONCLUb,2008-01-05T21:28Z,just joking :)
,themostoriginal,2008-01-11T04:02Z,wouldnt it be faster to just get it off the official site instead of coming here opening the torrent file then waiting for it finish......
,FidelCastroRuz,2008-01-16T21:30Z,"Yeah but it's better spread a bunch of stupid links (SPAM) for those idiots who don't know this is free. That's what LegalTorrents always do with their little Robin Hood message.

LegalTorrents FUCK YOU! Shove ur SPAM up ur ASS!

Long Live the Revolution!"
,Etern1ty,2008-01-25T14:04Z,i dont think its ilegal downloading free programs like this one.. why the  hell upload it as torrent when u can get at www.videolan.org??? naab legal
,assgrass89,2008-01-25T16:47Z,Fuck you morons! c'mon upload trailers and shit? what kinda pussybrain would download trailers from TPB??
,fairytales,2008-01-28T23:22Z,"I down loaded from www.videolan.org at 33 kb/s ( it took nearly 6 minutes ) , but thanks for the uploader ,at least he told us there is a new version , and thx for Mr. Etern1ty for reminding me of the site"
,jaybee276,2008-02-02T22:17Z,I just downloaded it using Bitlord from TPB and it took just less than 3 minutes.  So I would say a definite advantage. Less than half the time than from official site.
,Domzilla80,2008-02-04T04:56Z,"I downloaded it from videolan and it took 15 seconds, no bit torrent is going to be faster when your getting the file from a dozen different seeders piece by small piece instead of a full file straight from the site. at 100 kbs its still going to take you 90 seconds here because its over 9 mbs."
,bigsniffer08,2008-02-05T18:00Z,"at 100 kbs its still going to take you 90 seconds here because its over 9 mbs.

Oh my fucking god no tell me it's not true it can't be true no no no not a full fucking 90 seconds.

Dont know how long it took me to get it of the web as it finished before download manager could even tell me how big the file is or at what speed it was going.

And to those that insist on uploading trial programs such as Nero and adding a keygen, why the hell not just let us get Nero of the web at a good speed instead of having to rely on dog cunts that dont seed. Add the keygen in a separate file so we can just download if already have the program.

End rant. Thankyou for your attention."

,djTeka,2008-09-28T07:51Z,"I don't like VLC that much, your PC has to either be recently upgraded or something. I can't do anything else other than use this thing, have to shut everything else down.

I have XP, it's just old... And Linux can go screw itself, I don't want to have to know something to make my computer work, just to have it work.

,finneusj,2010-07-29T04:59Z,"Bitch and whine all you want, I still see a use in this torrent. I'm on an extremely weak wireless network, and attempting to download via HTTP proves to be a lost cause, as it slows down more and more and eventually halts, whereas torrents do not. So, to LegalTorrents, I appreciate your effort if nobody else does."
