Two and a half years have passed, and a 15 years old Naruto returns to the Leaf Village. He\\\\\\\'s taller and has a new outfit, but still retains his prankster nature and hot- headedness.  To the dismay of many, some of Jiraiya\\\\\\\'s pervertedness seems to have rubbed off on Naruto as well.  Time has passed for many of Naruto\\\\\\\'s friends as well, they have advanced from Genin to Chunin and some even became Jonin.  In fact, Naruto is the only one who is still a Genin from his graduating class way back from the Ninja Academy.  But there is little time for reunions. Akatsuki is on the move and continue to pursue their goal to capture all nine tailed demons, Naruto\\\\\\\'s own Kyuubi included. Their latest target, Gaara of the Sand.
