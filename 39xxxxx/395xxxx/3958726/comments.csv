,nimq,2008-01-03T21:08Z,"The update works fine, it is only for OSX 10.5
If you have OSX 10.4.x install update 1.3.0 from the lightroom website."

Try not to be an idiot from here on out..."
,dwalk51,2008-01-31T01:00Z,"Awesome man, finished downloading in under 10 mins, which was awesome, because I was getting an average of about 110 kb/s. Which I think is pretty good considering I usually get around 60 kb/s at best.
It's an awesome program, and as long as you follow the instructions you can be on your way to using an INCREDIBLE iphoto alternative.
Bravo nimq

P.S. for the email in registration I used the spam guys email that he left in the comments. He deserves it  ; )"
,tellag,2008-03-06T09:25Z,"I do not have lightroom installed yet. I see the torrent has 1.1 and the 1.3 update. Would I be better off d/ling the 1.3 trial from Adobe and using this serial? Or should I d/l this file, install 1.1 use the serial, then install the update? 

Sorry to  be so anal about this."
,nleboe,2008-03-06T21:50Z,thanks for post
,scrapetorrent,2008-03-13T15:34Z,I've switched to Aperture when version 2 came out last month - finally aperture is on par with the gui and performance. Anyone can tell me what's better about lightroom compares to Aperture 2?
,HotRockets8,2008-03-24T03:25Z,works great for me. thanks
,maracan,2008-04-17T01:04Z,"This works perfectly.  I already had version 1.1, so I cannot answer the problems some folks here have had.  Also, there is a new upgrade 1.4.1 that I just downloaded and installed without a problem.  Thanks ""nimq""!"
,whowes,2008-04-21T15:07Z,"Well done fellow seeders, downloaded at nearly 2000kbps, arrived in 36 seconds! "
,alb1973,2008-07-09T17:35Z,The 1.1.1 program works perfect.  Anyone can download the latest update (1.4.1) from the Adobe website.  Thank you for the add-ons nimq - very nice.
