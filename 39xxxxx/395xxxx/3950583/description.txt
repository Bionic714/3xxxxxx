This Torrent includes the albums "[seven sins]", "Before I Die" and "Higher Than Heaven, Louder Than God" by the band HeavensDust; consider this as a one-time offer to the P2P- community as it will expire by the 1st of January 2008.

All three albums have been bought and paid for after we've realized that there is no cheap way to get these albums and to listen to this kind of music.

So enjoy while it lasts. We will take no requests; these albums are all we are willing to offer you, including one dedicated machine that will seed this very torrent until January 1st, 2008.

After that it is up to you people to keep this torrent seeded and alive as we will not offer you a re-seed or a steady seeder beyond said day.

The single songs are coded to 320 kbyte/s and encoded as mp3s.

Good day to you all, the clock is ticking for freedom. 
Our freedom.
