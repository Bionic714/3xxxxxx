Radiohead\\\'s new album plus the bonus disc, both ripped by me from the CDs in the disc box itself.  Ripped using a Plextor Drive (best for pure DAE), with EAC in Secure mode, encoded in Q6 (~192kbps) Ogg Vorbis.  Tags are verified to be exactly as printed on the CDs, unlike the shitty ones provided by the likes of iTunes and others*.  Please, as always support the artists.

* - One of the bonus tracks is named \\\"Bangers + Mash\\\".  Itunes tags it \\\"Bangers & Mash\\\", and in other places it\\\'s called \\\"Bangers and Mash\\\".  It\\\'s a little difference, perhaps, but if you\\\'re a user of such services as Last.FM, it\\\'s important to get the little things right.
