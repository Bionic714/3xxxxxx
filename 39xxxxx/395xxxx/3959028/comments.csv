,wormby,2008-05-07T04:52Z,what the hell am i supposed to do with a .ogg file? 
,jellings,2008-06-07T21:07Z,"Bangers & Mash - 157,242 plays scrobbled on Last.fm


Bangers + Mash - 18,189 plays scrobbled on Last.fm


but then last.fm also says that the track spelt with a '&' is 4.01 mins long, and with a '+' is 3 minutes long.

usually whatever has the most plays is seen as the correct one on last.fm, but i could be wrong.



by the way, why .ogg? it's like betamax or HDDVD - no-one uses it! if you want a low filesize and compatibility use mp3, if you want pointlessly high quality use flac. 


the only advantage of ogg i could find anywhere was gapless playback, and i have gapless playback on itunes with mp3s anyway."
,jellings,2008-06-08T15:23Z,"Also. if you're going to write such a holier-than-thou comment, please make sure you get your facts right. On the CD itself it is labelled as Bangers & Mash.
If you don't believe me this torrent has scans of all the covers and both disks so you can check for yourself."

Wrong, sorry.  I own the deluxe boxed set.  The track is written ""Bangers + Mash"".  I read it myself, off the physical packaging, no scans needed.

Everyone else complaining about OGG:
Don't complain about it being like betaMAX, just get a better audio player.  MP3's ""gapless"" playback is a sloppy work-around hack, the rips still aren't truly gapless.  I like OGG for several reasons, and it's my format of choice.  You are free to transcode, if you can bear the idea.  Or, preferably, go buy the 2-cd boxset yourself like I did =)"
,The_Drunk_IT_Guy,2008-11-17T17:45Z,"Props to Falco98 for purchasing the Box set, you've got more money than I do. I was just looking for the tracks from the 2nd CD as I've dam near melted my In Rainbows CD from so much playback. I do wish you would've used a higher bit rate and something other than ogg but beggers cant be choosers. MK1 was short but amazing!

I'm buying you a virtual beer, enjoy!"
