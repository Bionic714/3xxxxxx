How to install:
1. Put the 2 .jar-files in your phone (eg. in the "Others" map if you use a Sony Ericsson mobile like me. [k810i])
2. Install the first file (mcs 1.0 crack.jar).
3. Install the second file (Micro Counter Strike 3D 1.0.jar) and replace it with the old one.
4. Play the game. (Controls and all that stuff, you will find at the Help-menu inside the game.)

And don't forget to write as a comment if the game worked/didn't worked on your mobile phone.
