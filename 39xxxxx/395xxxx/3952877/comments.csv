,VeganFreak,2008-05-28T02:01Z,"The vegans who read your post, wordofdoom, are likely former meat eaters who understand 100% your point of view, and how you actually can't defend your actions at all, and so you resort to this baseless and offensive jibba jibba about how you are superior to vegans whom you clearly don't understand (and likely never researched such a lifestyle) in order to defensively feel better about yourself and secured in the society of ignorance you help maintain, same way conservative americans are running around hysterically about the next terrorist attack and how we need to nuke the third world. Well we've heard this rhetoric before, some of us have probably said the same things as you. Try to be original. Here's a tip: Intellectual evolution."
