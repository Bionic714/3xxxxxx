Summary:


Weaving together interviews with animal rights activists, agribusiness representatives, and animal welfare experts with archival and documentary footage (including some very disturbing slaughter house scenes), Jennifer Abbott has produced an extraordinarily compelling, powerful and visually stunning feature documentary. A Cow at My Table presents a story which is far more complex than one with only two sides: It is a profound and intelligent look at animals, meat, & culture.

Directed, photographed, and edited by Jennifer Abbott, and featuring (in alphabetical order) Carol J. Adams, Jeannette Armstrong, Gene Bauston, Karen Davis, Ian Duncan, Susan Kitchen, Howard Lyman, Jim Mason, Tom Regan, Joy Ripley, Susan Schafers, Vandana Shiva, and Peter Singer. This film has won over a dozen international awards and nominations, including the Media Commendation Award from the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies and the WorldFest Gold Special Jury Award. 

(Canadian movie; total playing time: 90 minutes)
