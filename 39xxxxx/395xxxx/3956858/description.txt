This CD Version (2.1) Is for Flight Simulator 2004 Only

Flight One Software continues its "commitment to authenticity" with it's rendition of the PC-12. The performance of the 1200 hp Pratt & Whitney PT6A-67B turboprop engine, along with its Hartzell 4-blade aluminum prop, will take you to 30,000 feet as you SCREAM along at 310 mph. The available range of 2,239 NM will allow sim pilots to go coast-to-coast, with just one stop.

The aircraft add-on features include: a visual model with and without a virtual cockpit/cabin, accurate flight modeling, advanced glass avionics suite and a custom GPS system.

The package also includes caution and warning voice alerts in 4 languages; English, German, Spanish and French which can be selected from the included configuration manager. Both high and low resolution virtual cockpit options are available, and Flight1's Text-O-Matic repaint utility will allow you to expand your fleet with customized paint schemes. Also included is a detailed manual, point-and-click interactive tutorial and much, much more.

Pilatus PC12 2.31 Update : This update revises the font used to help reduce loading issues in the avionics and corrects overhead arrow-buttons/lights. Reboot! after installation!
