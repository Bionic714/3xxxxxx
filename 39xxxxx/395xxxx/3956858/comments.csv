,gixxer81,2008-06-01T10:59Z,"flightsimFS9: FSUIPC is free unregistered... you can get it on avsim or you can go for one of the registered copies here, but I've personally unregistered my copy because it causes problems with other addons for some reason"
,Dark One,2008-06-06T19:25Z,"Thanks, was searching for this plane for a while."
