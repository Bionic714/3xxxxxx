keep trying serials from anywhere you can find. it might take a while, but you should be able to find one that'll work. also, save often. my doom 3 lost the key about a quarter of the way through the game, made me restart."

I 1.downladed the program  2. mounted the iso and installed the program using a valid cd-key 3.  copied and pasted the 3 files from the deviance folder to the quake folder, overwriting the original quake 4.exe file

Whenever i run the program, i get the quake 4 splash screen, then a grey screen with an hour glass, and then the program closes.  

anyone know how to solve this problem?"

,nuclearbunny808,2008-08-04T04:05Z,"For all who have crappy computers and want to run this game:
I figured out a way how to run it! I have a 863 MHZ processor and a GeForce 2 card and I could still run it! Try to lower the screen resolution - for me it was 640 X 400. If your computer is better than mine use a slightly better resolution. If you have a high-res monitor, try lowering the resolution a bit. Also, run it in 256 colors. To do this, just go to the exe file and right click, go to properties, compatibility tab, and check run in 256 colors. If you haven't already, also check the 640 X 400 thing. However, I don't recommend doing it this way 'cause it kinda screwed up my computer when I was trying to do it for RE4. Anyways, it should change the settings automatically to the correct resolution and color when you start the game. Since it closes, I dunno. If you can post your computer specs, maybe I can help you."

 then follow ""davy73davy73"" link to the safe disc,u get a crack with that aswell (also virus free!!), 
when u put them in DONT COPY OVER TOP OF CRACK,U NEED NO-CD.EXE AND SAFEDISC IN THE GAME DIR. the second 1 will try to overwrite the 1st cos they r both EXE's. gonna try the update now, will post if there r any hitches.

 i'd still recommend the keygen i got as i havent tried the game with the already mentioned keys since i put the fixed crack in (may or may not work).
If u have problems running in vista, try right clicking shortcut and run as admin, it couldnt makes its own files when patching or going online so i did that n it worked.
to people like ""genghis_khan_92 "" u do know u only need the Q4.exe, not the deviance.exe, or the nfo inside the game dir.the NFO is instructions (open with notepad) the deviance.exe is jus sum fancy splash screen of D's own making.FRAG U LATER!!"

,ajb1978,2008-09-04T16:57Z,"This ISO works great!  Installs like a breeze, and Deviant's included no-cd crack performs beautifully.  The only hang-up is when Activision checks the CD key, but an easy way around that is to rig your firewall to block Quake4.exe from accessing the Internet.  Then, when Quake4.exe attempts to contact the authorization server to validate your CD key, it fails to connect, and assumes the key is valid by default. :)  Obviously this makes multiplayer impossible, but enh...Quake 4 wasn't exactly known for its multiplayer anyhow.

first unrar it if its a rar
or zip if its a iso image, i think you know what to do
and if you need daemon tools mount it. 
after installing (if its needed to install it)
put crack in to the folder where the exe is 
and it should work if you need some advices for
installing games leave a message by messenger for me   messenger adress:joonashalinen@hotmail.com
