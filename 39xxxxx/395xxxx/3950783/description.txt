			WarioWare: Touched! features all the
			frantic five-second microgame action of
			the previous WarioWare games, but with a
			touching new twist. You can play every
			microgame with the Nintendo DS touch
			screen, making it the perfect game for
			the system\\\'s unique touch screen
			technology. Not only that, but you can
			even play some microgames with the
			Nintendo DS built-in microphone/

			Wario\\\'s latest batch of microgames are
			more insane than ever thanks to the new
			touch screen interface. In one game, you
			have to use the stylus to guide a twisted
			piece of tissue into an unsuspecting
			nostril. If the nose sneezes, you win.    
			In another, you use the stylus to carve a 
			statue by chipping away at a large stone
			block. The games are faster and goofier
			than ever, which will make this title a
			sure-fire hit for any WarioWare fan.
