,willdrumz,2008-01-03T08:40Z,What the hell are you people talking about? It's been corrupted as hell... by a 3rd party. IT WILL NOT OPEN IN iSERIAL READER!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
,orrefan,2008-01-03T16:59Z,This is the real deal! SerialSeeker/Reader is required to read the file.

,ardentflame,2008-01-16T13:22Z,"hey willdrumz... you have to install the new version of iserial reader so that your security certificate is valid, otherwise you will get the error you got"
