,Doomtor,2008-02-23T02:49Z,"This torrent is only missing
-The tome of salvation
-Nights dark masters
-Realm of the ice queen
-Lure of the lich king.

I can't find any of those here, does any one have them?"
,king_rat,2008-03-21T02:44Z,"Not me, not yet.  Still looking."
,mortishere,2008-04-13T02:09Z,"I can't even seem to BUY Tome of Salvation anywhere :-(
But i will attempt to scan and upload some of the others on your wish list Doomtor when i get a chance.
I look forward to looking though some of the old ones.

Thanks for the Upload King_Rat."
,wfrp_guy,2008-04-18T01:11Z,Those four books are on my list as well! Grrrrrrrrrrrrr. Can't find them ANYWHERE!
,wfrp_guy,2008-04-18T01:16Z,Forgot to say thanks for what you do have here though. This will fill in a few gaps in my collection. Thought I already had most of the first edition stuff...
,RampantAI,2008-04-20T16:15Z,"Great reference to complement the ""live"" books. Great to be able to bring all the books with me in just a thumbdrive or my laptop instad of carrying the whole ~50cm stack. Just bringing the really important books for the session. Tried to find the four books aswell, but no luck... "
,Doomtor,2008-05-02T13:04Z,"I have recently aquired a hard copy of the ""Tome of Salvation"". I have some time off coming up and I will hopefully be able to scan and upload it."
,high_sourcery,2008-05-03T04:54Z,Yeah Doom! Man would it be great to finally devour that impossible to find book. Much thanks in advance.
,Entomophobie,2008-05-07T15:51Z,I expect a lot to get the pdf version of Tome of Salvation.  I own the hard copy and it is a amazing book for warhammer universe.  It is as important as Tome of Corruption.  Nothing less.  Thanks a lot Doomtor for the share files.  I hope you will make a great quality pdf for ToS : )
,raxmm,2008-05-21T22:30Z,"still no news from tome of salvation? :'(
I'm also looking for Thousand Thrones, guess it'll never get printed in France :째

thanks for the upload btw :]"
,RampantAI,2008-06-01T19:59Z,"Still no Tome of Salvation, Nights dark masters or Thousand Thrones Campaign? Annyone? "
,RampantAI,2008-06-01T20:01Z,"Oh, and thanks alot for the upload! =)

(another book kit is found here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3536004/WFRP_-_warhammer_rpg )"
,Doomtor,2008-06-02T06:01Z,Unfortunetly I will be unable to provide The tome of salvation like I said I would. My scanner seems to have borked its self and scans seem to be just multicoloured swirls. If (and when?) I get around to fixing/replacing my scanner Ill try again.
,Entomophobie,2008-06-03T17:43Z,"Awwww, that's unfortunate : (  In all cases, keep us in touch if you succeed to have a pdf copie of it."
,Uulbaan,2008-08-20T19:20Z,"Here you go, you can get the book Tome of Salvation at this address:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4352866/Warhammer_Tome_of_Salvation

I'll seed it for a while then someone else will have to upload the file again to share it with the community, because I won't be able to seed it indefinitely.

Enjoy and support the wfrp products made by Fantasy Flight Games (FFG) if you like this book."
,tman_694,2008-12-31T07:39Z,"Here are 3 of the books.

Still looking for Lure of the lich king.  ToS & RotIQ scanned by me."
,joakimstahl,2008-12-31T13:38Z,"Thanks all for this great collection!

Anyone have access to ""The Thousand Thrones"" as a pdf?

Would greatly appreciate it."
,8ZSGwA,2009-02-19T09:15Z,"I'm working on a Renegade crowns generator/Border princes generator in Excel. Is it possible for any of you actually have their own paper book of this product to scan it in at least 300 dpi and put it on the priate bay?

appreciate "
,Luckmann,2009-03-28T22:57Z,"I'm looking for Shades of Empire, Career Compendium, Lure of the Liche Lord and The Thousand Thrones. It's the only ones I'm missing now, as far as I know.

Anyone have access to them? I'd love a torrent, but anything is acceptable."
,Shadowspoon,2009-04-16T20:30Z,"I too am looking for the Career Compendium, anyone?"
,egalor,2009-06-01T09:10Z,"The Thousand Thrones.pdf torrent is available at mininova.

Within a month or so, Shades of the Empire and Career Compendium will become online as well."
,egalor,2009-06-02T22:11Z,"Look, I've found The Thousand Thrones!

,Luckmann,2009-06-05T18:10Z,"Yay, Egalor! I love you! :D"
,egalor,2009-06-22T17:34Z,"Guys, you may want to know that FFG have released legal .pdf's for sale (http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=615). 

It's $25 per rulebook and $15 per supplement. 

One major thing is that the they _incorporate the official errata_.

,kriegtanzer,2009-06-26T04:11Z,"I just found Shades of Empire
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4965515/WFRP_-_Shades_of_Empire

I bought it when I came out but I love just having to take my laptop to gaming instead of a library worth of books."
,kriegtanzer,2009-06-30T00:35Z,Looking for Witch Hunters Handbook.  It is OOP.
,Gognar,2009-09-20T21:32Z,"Thx!

,Gognar,2009-09-21T16:49Z,Thx!
,Uulbaan,2009-10-03T07:41Z,"The Career Compendium is now available in official pdf format on rpgnow.com.


(The GM tool kit is also available over there.  The small booklet in this kit is useful for the numerous random encounter table generator.)"
,saturnine4,2010-08-02T14:54Z,Man I can't fucking find tome of salvation. That one link that guy had doesn't work anymore.
