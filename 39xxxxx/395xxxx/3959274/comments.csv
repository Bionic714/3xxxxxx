,desertlightning,2008-01-03T10:56Z,"Dear Dohduhdah,

Ta tanks tanx.
Are these the series of j peg shots put togther in a series titled ""Fine Art Photography"" by an uploader who also upped a ton of scanned prints of modern  paintings?

If so, this is a gorgeous torrent and thanks a stack."
[V],dohduhdah,2008-01-04T02:13Z,"on demonoid I think it was called ""contemporary masters of photographers(sic)"".. 
it's just a big collection of more than 22000 pictures from various famous photographers (about 350 photographers)"
[V],joshua13,2008-01-04T04:39Z,I think the uploader was xudong
,desertlightning,2008-01-04T12:08Z,"Yes, that's the guy, joshua13, Xudong. Do you or anyone else happen to have that/some of that collection? My hard drive crashed and I lost all my Demonoid jewels. In the meantime much thanks again dohduhdah."
[V],dohduhdah,2008-01-05T03:03Z,"Yes, I think it was Xudong indeed on demonoid. I have more art collections from demonoid and I will upload them to piratebay once the current collections have been uploaded."
,d34m0n1x,2008-01-06T07:33Z,"This is really great collection.
Thank you dohduhdah.
What else do you have :-)?"
[V],dohduhdah,2008-01-07T19:21Z,"I got various collections from demonoid (art and photographs) put them all in one folder, removed duplicates and that yielded a whopping 25 gb collection of over 122000 images. Nice practice material for photoshop but also great to shuffle in irfanview or acdsee."
,PeterAichinger,2008-01-15T04:39Z,"Why packed all together in a huge rar? I don't even think to begin of a 5 GB download (as I know I would never finish it), but I surely could finde some images interesting me that I have had downloaded if this were a download where one could dl just the photos he is interested in."
[V],dohduhdah,2008-01-18T08:41Z,"Dunno.. personally I have no problems with rar files or large single file downloads. Broadband internet is getting pretty common these days, at least where I'm living. Hopefully it will soon be as ubiquitous as television and mobile phones."
,desertlightning,2008-02-11T10:07Z,"Dear dohduhdah,
Over a month later and I finally finish downloading your superb torrent. The wait was well worth it. A thousand thanks. My screensaving will never be the same."
,bigtable,2008-02-16T17:43Z,"For what it is worth, the contents of this torrent are being converted to poster sized images (30"" wide @ 300dpi) suitable for photo finishing, large format ink jet, etc..  Some of it is here on TPB like piratebay.org/tor/4012697/Andy_Goldsworthy__forty-five_large_format_art_prints ... others can be downloaded at http://popartmachine.com"

,maffiakillen,2009-12-16T04:11Z,">> ButterBricks! ButterBricks....  

 You could view that picture om img sites like picassa  or another image-site, were it is free to uppload a photo for the public and then just post the link here on comments"
,blurth44,2010-01-07T03:20Z,Excellent collection of sometimes rare work - many thanks to those who compiled and uploaded it.  Highly recommended!
,navaneet,2011-01-22T09:34Z,"@darabuka If the file size of a single file is more than 4GB, you need an NTFS File system Drive in your Harddisk. You probably have FAT File System installed. Either you have to format your system to an NTFS Drive or check the file systems of all other drives you have in your computer by seeing it's properties. If one drive say 'E' is having NTFS File System, you can download this file to that drive."
,khaledmid,2011-04-16T19:39Z,"WOW, I have been Collect photos 8 years and i never see great pictures like this before......"
,khaledmid,2011-04-16T19:43Z,thanks dohduhdah.... but its not no demonoid i tried to upload this torrent to demonoid but its refused... 
,BirdFeed,2011-09-08T01:13Z,Not the collection of high res images I was hoping for. This torrent is all about quantity not quality (some of the scans are really bad). But it's an excellent resource to become educated on some of the most influential photographers of the last century. (I have no idea how this collection ended up being over 5GB though)
