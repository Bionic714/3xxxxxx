_____________________________________________________________Summary__

"I consider this tribunal false tribunal, and these indictments false
indictments. It is illegal." - Former Serbian president Slobodan
Milosevic.

And so begins Milosevic on Trial. The doco spans four years, from
2002 - 2006, during which time Slobodan Milosevic was tried at the
International Criminal Tribunal for genocide, war crimes and crimes
against humanity.

During this period the filmmakers had exclusive access to key
players: Milosevic's legal adviser Dragoslav Ognjanovic ("To be the
lawyer of a man like him, it is a great honor." and prosecution
attorney Geoffrey Nice ("This trial is about the accused's rise to
power - power that was exercised without accountability,
responsibility or morality."

It was the prosecution's job to prove that Slobodan Milosevic had
a hand in the deaths of 250,000 people across three wars in
Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. In the end, the charges were never
proven because Slobodan Milosevic died in custody of a heart attack.

As this intricate and detailed film shows, trying to prove the
charges was a mammoth task for the prosecution, given the
relatively short period of time allowed for the trial.

The film also grants viewers a fascinating insight into the mind
of Milosevic, a man determined to defend himself by attacking the
legitimacy of the court, claim that foreign powers were behind
the wars and use the media to his advantage.

It is a confronting film, one that compels you to listen in horror
to heart-wrenching testimony from massacre survivors and then see
the human side of Slobodan Milosevic: a devoted grandfather, a
kindly father figure to his lawyer and an elderly man whose health
ultimately doesn't stand up to the stress of the trial.

Milosevic on Trial is international justice in action with all its
successes, failings, twists and turns laid bare for the viewer. It
is gruesomely humorous in parts, as the accused and his witnesses
continually rant at the judges, and ultimately it raises the
question whether courts such as the International Criminal Tribunal
can ever truly achieve what they set out to do?
