,bjk22,2008-08-11T14:16Z,Uzbek is farsi based? Uzbek is not farsi based it is 100% pure turkic language
,Alisherxan,2009-04-18T00:12Z,"Hi remy1492, I would also recomend  ""Shahzoda"", ""Rayhon"", Nasiba Abdullaeva"" and ""Manzura"". These artists may not be as good as Sevara but definitely worth trying. Let me know if you liked them, or wish to know more about similar artists in Uzbekistan.
