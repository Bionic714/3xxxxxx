Uzbek music, Sevarah has a very nice clear voice.  Uzbek is farsi based but part turkish as well.  I heard her while in Uzbekistan on deployment to Afghanistan.  Then heard her on Hearts of Space.  Track #11 will calm you down.

Uber relaxing.  This might be in instrumental or folk or even new age areas of a store.

if you know any other artists like her let me know.
You might also check out the other Jalan Jalan upload I put up.

oops, was confusing Uzbek with Afghan, it was all in the same deployment that I visited the Stans.  But Uzbeks were the friendliest :)
