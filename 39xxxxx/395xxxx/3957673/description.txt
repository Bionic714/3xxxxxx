This is really cool and just for us XP users. Lust click on the WinFlip.exe in this folder and then make a quick circle with your mouse and watch as you scroll through your open windows, just like Vista but better b/c it is XP!

*To end just end the WinFlip.exe in the task manager.

Also see my TrueTransparency torrent, your windows will be clear like Vista
