If you think you need a TV Card to watch Television online?

Than I have come up with a solution. Watch Television and Listen to Radio Online. This software will enable you to listen to indian Radiostations Live as well as watch Television without spending lots of money on your DTH or Set top box.

This software is based as a Tool bar in your Internet explorer browser. Please note in order to have an enhanced performance and a good quality watching and listening you will need Microsoft Internet explorer 6.0 or higher version. This software will work with Mozilla Fire fox, but you will not be able to get any optimum results.

Enjoy!!!
