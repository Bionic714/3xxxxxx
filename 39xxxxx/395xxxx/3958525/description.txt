Description:

This X-rated film follows the adventures of Willard, a mild-mannered insurance investigator. He checks on the claim of an old woman, the owner of a tattoo parlor, who puts out a claim listing her as being dead. She tells 

him that her Ouija board gave her a message that she would be killed by a wizard. Willard tells her that she will not receive any money until she is dead, and, suddenly, she dies of a heart attack. Her will states that her 

killer would receive possession of her duck. The Dirty Duck takes Willard on a quest to experience life to the fullest.

Note:

The music and voices were created by Flo & Eddie (Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan), who were part of Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention. The same company (and director) made some animated sequences for 200 

Motels a few years earlier.
