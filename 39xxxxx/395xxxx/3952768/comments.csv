,Stronium,2007-12-30T07:15Z,"I got it yesterday and the quality of this screener is bad. There are huge ""TV scan lines"", bitmaps, and overall quality is like 4 of 10 ... wait for a better version."
,DrChandra,2007-12-30T21:30Z,"stronium is lying. the quality is rather good. it looks like an NTSC VHS copy (probably because it is) of a master.
it seems to be missing the intro text so it's likely an internal preview version but certainly watchable"
,DrChandra,2007-12-30T23:03Z,"it's like the atlantis eps that got leaked. it's missing final versions of special effects here and there, some post processing, credits, maybe some foley.
Mel Brooks was a visionary. Instant cassettes :)"
