,thedaf,2008-01-14T17:55Z,"7 anslutna och 27 i svärmen. Vad betyder svärmen??

Fått hem 71% och den ligger nu på 200b/s - 1000b/s

Har tankat dygnet runt i en vecka typ."
,Crusader66,2008-01-17T18:00Z,"!!!Warning!!!

F.Y.I. There is NO subtitles for the Native Americans in this movie. So ya it's in English and there is a dozen subtitle tracks in every damn language. BUT it is totally fucking useless to anybody that does not speak viking or ikea. 
Thank you to everybody that uploads.
This upload however wasted days of my download time and bandwidth. I also wasted the fist hour that I spent watching it. And now I want to watch this movie and I need to find it and download it again. 

You could have saved me this trouble by putting a note to this effect or just posting a file with one little English track.

,phusg,2008-01-19T16:48Z,"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Guys please include English subs for these releases. It's only going to degrade the video by 0.001% and you'll be making a lot more people happy..."
,mushroom77,2008-01-23T14:08Z,THANKS for the heads up guys i nearly download this!
,tubescreemer,2008-02-09T14:59Z,"Well... as stated in the nfo in the beginning of the thread... It's a Nordic release and it says...Subs: Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish. I don't know who said English subs... But i wasn't me :) "
,fergulix,2008-02-16T12:40Z,"tack som fan , har letat länge efter denna. :D"
,blackhog42,2008-03-04T09:00Z,thanks for the warning also!  saved me a lot of trouble
,jiopi,2008-04-24T20:24Z,"This isn't the 236min Directors Cut, this is the 224min extended edition."
,cotes42,2008-05-06T13:55Z,"yeah me too, glad to see the warning , been through 3 copies so far and no subs for the Native Americans. "
,xyz3352008,2009-01-13T12:29Z,"we need one with Englih sub at least
please redo it againg
thanks"
,7hirsty,2010-09-06T11:03Z,"99,9% loaded and then it stopped. FUCK!!!"
,531vx3,2011-03-29T00:26Z,Seed...!
,BlasterMas,2011-05-03T14:40Z,"Being in 99,9% for quite some time.. any seeders left?

For people want to watch this movie without waiting for that missing 0,01%, unpack it with winrar with setting keep broken archives (or similar to keep non complete iso-file) and it should be pretty much watchable."
