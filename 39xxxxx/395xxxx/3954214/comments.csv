Wiki says: : The Beaver Trilogy (2001) is a documentary film directed by Trent Harris, featuring Sean Penn, Crispin Glover and co-starring Courtney Gains.
The Beaver Trilogy combines three separate vignettes that were filmed at different times--in 1979, 1981, and 1985. The first, entitled The Beaver Kid, is a short documentary about the exploits of Groovin' Gary, a performer that filmmaker Harris happened upon while filming for a Salt Lake City, Utah news station. Harris filmed Gary, a rabid Olivia Newton-John obsessive, as he staged a talent show that featured Gary dressed in full drag singing the Newton-John song ""Please Don't Keep Me Waiting"".
The second installment, called The Beaver Kid 2 features Sean Penn as ""Groovin' Larry"" in a dramatic interpretation of the original documentary. The trilogy is completed with The Orkly Kid, in which Crispin Glover reprises Penn's role.
The film was also featured in the public radio show This American Life in the episode entitled, ""Reruns."" The episode first aired December 6, 2002.
