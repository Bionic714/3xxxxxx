* Don't worry about the mkv format, all you need is just Haali Media Splitter and ffdshow.
* If you want a all in one solution, I recommend Combined Community Codec Pack http://www.cccp-project.net/
* I kept the commentary track because I thought someone might like it. In case you hear someone talking over the movie, you should probably switch the audio stream. :)
