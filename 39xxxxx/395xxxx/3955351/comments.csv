Although, to be fair, Media Player Classic and BSPlayer will work fine too if the proper codecs are installed.

Use Google to find these players, if you're interested.

[T],metalcore.,2008-01-02T08:03Z,dude...avi ....mkv sucks shit and is incompatible for standalones....if you are gonna make rips do em right ;)
,gigivaluta,2008-01-02T16:21Z,"Mkv is a superior format to avi in almost every single ways, except it is not supported by standalone DVD players. This will probably change in a few years but because I only watch movies from my PC, I don't really care about that. 

As I made the rip firstly for myself, I can assure you that a x264/mkv combo gives the best quality at a given bitrate on almost everything."
,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-06T07:15Z,"I agree with *gigivaluta*. MKV is the best format for ripping DVDs. Nothing even comes close. There's the added advantage of muxing the subtitles with the rip. 
If you really want to watch it on a player, better buy the DVD? "
,oldtex29,2008-03-13T21:50Z,"  Can someone explain to me how can I get the english subtitles to work? I'm using Windows Media Player Classic.  I'm just getting the Romanian subs. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  

 BTW, it appears that I am the only seeder of this file so I will upload for as long as I can.  "
,gigivaluta,2008-03-16T19:46Z,"If you have Haali media splitter, you should be able to click on the system tray icon and select the language and/or subtitle language.

In media player classic you should be able to switch subtitle language by pressing the S key and audio with the A key. :)"
,oldtex29,2008-03-20T05:25Z," gigibvaluta - 

 Thanks a ton.  Not only for uploading this fantastic movie, but for monitoring the comments section and providing helpful advice.  You rock.  "
,zeinabqureshi,2008-05-05T12:18Z,"I very nearly made the mistake of ripping Andrei Rublyov... luckily I decided to check tpb, and noticed this wonderful rip. MKV is the best format for ripping large films...or any sort of film. I'd commented on this earlier, and if you're interested in watching this on standalone, you can burn a DVD using ConvertXtoDVD, which works well with MKV files. Available on tpb. 

Making an xvid of such a huge film would be a waste of time, especially as XVID doesn't compare well with Matroska.

Again, thanks for the upload."
,Esenin,2008-07-27T12:37Z,so is this supported by cyberlink Power dvd?

,slumcat,2009-09-18T14:25Z,This is by far the best rip of the full version I have come across. The quality is very good and the audio commentary is very useful. Thanks a million.
