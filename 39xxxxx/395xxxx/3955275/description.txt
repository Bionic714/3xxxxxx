Instructions on how to convert Nitro Stunt Racing Stage 1 from German to English.


1.) Install the game using the serial key located in the "Postmortem" directory on the disc. If you do not have the serial key, use the following.

*****-*****-*****-*****-*****-***** (Key does not work for English demo)


2.) Go to "C:\Program Files\NSR_Stage_1\System\Resources" and make a backup of the folders with the following names.

TextureBanks
Scripts

Renaming them would be the easiest way. e.g. TextureBanks_bak & Scripts_bak


3.) Copy the "TextureBanks" and "Scripts" folders from this package into the same directory where you made backup folders. If you've closed the folder, read step number two.

4.) Run the file titled "Game_Seed.reg" and click yes to add the information to your registry.

5.) Play the game.
