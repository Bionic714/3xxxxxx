Flac files are massive and senseless.
Look at the size of this album."
,JonnyDr,2008-01-04T00:26Z,Is that right? Are they massive because the author of compression algorithm is crap> Maybe he didn't know about lossy codecs. OR maybe there's something else to it? Hmm. Tough one.
,JonnyDr,2008-01-04T00:34Z,"You should let Mr. Coalson know that MP3 exists, and that it compresses much better than his ""sucky"" codec. He'll appreciate the time you save him I'm sure.
Has noone got a waffles.fm or what.cd invite going? I could (clearly!) do with one at the mo! *weeps*"
,abbey4000,2008-01-05T16:21Z,"Busker,

FLAC files are great if you care about preserving the original CD sound quality. Most people do. Obviously you don't."
,bigman1968,2009-01-21T23:10Z,Busker  you are just stupid. buy the cd dumbass
,VelcroT,2010-08-16T23:31Z,"You know, you can convert the FLAC files into MP3s and then delete the FLACs. 

Simple."
,ojaideadhead,2010-08-28T00:27Z,Please...If you don't want quality recordings go record it off the radio or something What's wrong with you?
