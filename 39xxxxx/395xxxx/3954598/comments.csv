,tang199,2008-01-05T14:39Z,"Sorry kind of a newbie - looking for suggestions on the best way to work with srt subtitles.

Thanks!"
,dkz-callum,2008-01-06T14:30Z,seed plz i am downloading at 8 kb 
,x_ile,2008-01-07T17:09Z,"Tang199, if you're still having trouble, dl & install  VobSub from
http://www.free-codecs.com/download/DirectVobSub.htm
Keep your language .srt in the same folder as the vid. (I'd delete the other langs, if any, just to keep it simple.)

I've no idea how it works, but it works fine for me (WMP 11 on XP). Good luck."

,Demordio,2009-06-16T23:26Z,Dos this film has the original audio? or is it in English?
,TrashCompaqtor,2009-06-19T20:38Z,"FIXED ENGLISH SUBTITLES HERE:

http://subscene.com/english/city-of-god-cidade-de-deus/subtitle-235956.aspx

The subs bundled with this copy are VERY flawed with grammatical errors, and also some timing.  I took a better copy and synced it to match the FXG rip of the movie.

Also, thanks for the movie!  Good quality for a 2-hour running time."
,miakolee,2009-08-14T16:48Z,thanks
,katzin,2009-10-15T16:53Z,"Great Upload!

and just a clarification: Elite Squad (Tropa de Elite) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4521878/The.Elite.Squad.2007.DVDRIP-ZEKTORM, is NOT from the same director of City of God (Cidade de Deus). 
ES is JosĂŠ Padilha and CoG was directed by Fernando Meirelles.

,mad0_o,2010-04-06T03:19Z,thanks.. what about the .srt file?
,mucgoo,2010-06-19T18:38Z,"The .srt file is in the folder.

You can't have this with English dialogue without dubbing, and that would ruin the film."
,kuttootta,2010-07-27T18:26Z,"Thanks FXG for the great movie.

The movie is originally in portugese and this also English subtitle with the torrents.

,StanleyTheManly,2011-11-17T14:32Z,"Subtitles are NOT hardcoded, just in case anyone was wondering.  If you're planning on watching this on a PS3 or burning it, you'll have to put the subtitles in yourself.  Here are some pretty easy instructions on how to do it.  Otherwise, the quality on this is great as always with FXG team.

,ash93,2012-04-18T09:17Z,"i tried playing the downloaded torrent but there was no sound. :( 
what should i do?"
,skbart,2012-06-13T08:18Z,"The real name of this move is Cidade de Deus, respect the real name of the movie!"
,stevesie,2012-07-06T18:03Z,"@skbart First of all, look in the description dumbass, it has the ""real"" name of the movie. Secondly, a point of a title is to reflect on the movie in some way, and since not everyone can speak Portuguese, it make's a lot more since to translate it then to leave it as is."
