,AdamsCrabapple,2008-01-17T09:27Z,"Seeder Seeder,
why hast thou forsaken me?

Seeder Seeder,
wherefore art thou?

The meek shall inherit the mirth
The geek shall inherit the girth
But the seeder that stutters
Who pulls down his shutters
Shall deformed ever be from his birth"
,AdamsCrabapple,2008-01-17T16:05Z,"Thankyou Canuk, whoever you are for seeding.
I'll follow your good example :-)"

Canuck-the-Noble-Seeder is back!
Thanks mate. Your 2kB/s is more than appreciated.
I'll curb my rash, impulsive desire to rant in the comments column.
Thanks to Swede-the-Seed who was there for a while last night :-)
