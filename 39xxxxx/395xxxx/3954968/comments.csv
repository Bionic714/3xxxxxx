,Docoptik,2008-01-08T17:02Z,Is there any change to find somewhere the game in English version?? Pleeeaseee...
,lieven2008,2008-05-13T21:55Z,"Docoptik, try this ed2k://|file|Evil.Islands.zip|815133158|95A2377E83AFC16597105767554C81AC|/
I haven't downloaded yet, but hope it's english."
,xqmxqm,2008-05-20T18:51Z,I have downloaded and installed the rar lieven2008 provides and can confirm it's a 100% workable English version. It's an excellent game; I don't know why it has never become popular.
,sid777,2008-06-08T13:44Z,"Can you provide another link? This one doesn't seem to be working. Or I just don't know the way to make this one work.
I've been searching for an english version for 2 years now,both on internet and in normal distribution. "

,CosmicKeys,2008-11-26T03:50Z,"Hi Guys - 

If you want to use the link you'll first need to download the P2P program eMule.

Next, head to - http://www.amule.org/wiki/index.php/Ed2k_links_handling

Follow the instruction for your OS/Browser. Then you're all set."
