,polarfox,2008-01-04T01:20Z,"I found Red Rabbit on my old HD.. HD is partially bad, so I would really like some feedback from this.. I tested some of the files and they sounded ok.. http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3960397"
,cdbaric,2008-01-05T11:01Z,"Sound quality is awful!

It is a huge audio download - it should sound excellent!

I DLed a couple of the mp3s and listened and then I shitcanned the whole thing - do not waste your time.

Total Crap!

Thank you to the Seeders.

But the sound quality makes it unuseable.
It sounds like somebody trying to read and eat Oatmeal while shoving a Soldering Iron up a Cat's Butt.

Try again."
,plasmaview,2008-08-13T15:42Z,"Dang, I should have read the comments first.  This is unusably bad audio.  Please remove this torrent!"
,b00b13s,2009-09-02T23:15Z,Not the best audio quality BUT you will NOT find this anywhere else! I've tried. I've even tried finding a legal copy I can buy but you can only get the abridged version.
,Irda,2010-02-04T16:48Z,"Yeah,the sound IS bad.But it is the real deal and I still enjoy the book."
,bjr2293,2011-03-04T09:23Z,The sound is not great but tolerable for most of the book.  There is a section that is pretty bad but you can still make out what is being said.  Thanks Polarfox and seeders.

Click on this link if you want the torrent directly ripped from the CD.  After much painstaking searching I finally found a torrent with good sound quality. 

Thanks for uploading this torrent polarfox and keeping it up as long as you have in the face of RIAA fascism :)"
