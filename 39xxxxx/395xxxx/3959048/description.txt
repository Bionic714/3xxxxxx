-David's Tool Kit: A Citizen's Guide to Taking Out Big Brother's Heavy Weapons-

Homemade thermite grenades, flame-throwers, smoke bombs, and the ultimate Molotov cocktail. Gil Scott-Heron used to say, "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," but we all know that he was wrong -- we've seen too many pictures of civilians armed with gasoline-filled soda bottles taking on tanks! Ragnar Benson explains how modern-day Davids can slay Goliath in his latest manual on making urban war.

This book shows how someone can effectively take out enemy tanks, APC's, fighter aircraft, unarmored vehicles, helicopters, and artillery positions. It truly is a fascinating and interesting book to read. 223 pages.
