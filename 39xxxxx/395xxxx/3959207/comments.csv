,mazon,2008-01-08T23:14Z,A question: At the end of disc 6 they tell you the program will continue on disc 7.... but this torrent only has 6 discs? Is there more discs?
,plasmaview,2008-01-12T05:50Z,"No, there are only 6 discs.  Here is what is on the Barnes & Noble web site:

(Compact Disc - Unabridged, 6 CDs, 416 minutes)"
[T],werty11,2008-01-24T20:01Z,How do you play these files???
,plasmaview,2008-01-28T02:03Z,"Go to http://www.speex.org.  From there you can download what you need for whatever OS you are using.

Speex is incredible.  Here it shrunk 6 full CDs down to 132 MB, with near perfect fidelity."

,atom224,2008-03-01T22:54Z,i downloaded this from my local library and it was in 9 wma parts. It is about 116 megs.
,samwood,2008-04-09T23:03Z,I own this book and I can confirm that disk six ends right in the middle of a story.  There is still another 2+ chapters remaining.
,plasmaview,2008-05-07T03:57Z,"I just checked with my local library and they carry it, and it's indeed 7 CDs.  Unfortunately I am #20 in the queue so it may be several weeks or months before I can get disk #7.  When I get it I will create a new torrent for just that disk and add a comment here with the URL for it."
,samwood,2008-06-03T23:40Z,Thatd be nice plasmaview
