,theredux,2007-12-29T22:12Z,"Bryce: the files are small in disk space because they are a small resolution. They were made for iPod or other smaller-screens (cell phones, etc.) -- 320x420 resolution.
As noted in the description, I tested these out on an iPod Nano (3rd generation) and it works great. "
,nleboe,2008-01-02T01:37Z,do you think it would look blurry on the iPod Classic???
,theredux,2008-01-08T20:32Z,"nleboe: it may look blurry if the iPod stretches the pixels to fit screen. I'm not sure of the resolution of your iPod classic! Give it a go, let us know how it works :) "
