,Ich1raku,2007-12-29T18:41Z,haha  you bought a black macbook its a total ripoff  theirs 200 dollars between the macbook i have and the one you have that aren't accounted for  i know because i wanted to get the black one. essentially the black macbook charges 200 dollars for a color change
,samsugar,2007-12-30T00:18Z,hmm... i must be missing something. is there a key for this?
,leopard_OX,2007-12-30T12:03Z,There isn't a key......this is an UPDATE to Guitar Pro. Download Guitar Pro 5 (or what ever version) then download this update I posted for Guitar Pro to work on the Leopard OS. Hope this helps you. 
,leopard_OX,2007-12-30T12:08Z,"Ich1raku......My macbook was free, and who cares anyways? Learn to write english better, you don't make sense. (especially if your going to make fun of people)"
,Gasolain,2008-01-03T22:31Z,"If anyone has the full version of Guitar Pro 5, upload plz."
,psykozz,2008-01-07T19:52Z,"Hello guys!
Thanks for this great up leopard_OX! ;-)

Here is the serial number for GP5, it works fine.

USER ID = 5INT9195505
KEY ID = ARAAR-B4BWB-4BKK9

Do not register the software !!!

You don't need to install GP5 before updating... You can install only and directly GP5.3! ;-)

Enjoy! ;-)"
,StxJimmy,2008-01-09T14:36Z,"Great tnx!

Just one question ... Does somebody has the 3 RSE ""files"" for me?"
,MAECX,2008-01-10T22:42Z,how can i run this thing on windows????? can somebody plz help me?
,kreo123,2008-01-11T23:05Z,"Did any get RSE running with this? I can't enable it in menu, it seemes it requires 5.3 compatible RSE library install... :("
,mirbeau1,2008-01-12T14:38Z,"Hi there! I need help... Could anybody PLEASE tell me how I am supposed to enter the serial number in Guitar Pro 5 for Mac. (I downloaded the demoversion which has run out by now and I just don't see any place where I could enter the serial) I`d appreciate any sort of help, pretty desperate... Thx"
,lemonjenny,2008-01-17T08:46Z,"For some reason these .dmg files all say ""failed to mount"". Anyone have any idea why?"
,2rri,2008-01-17T17:10Z,"you need Toast 8 Titanium to mount this. but that is not necessary. just double click the icon and it will open like all .dmg files on os x. simple as pie!

and for the one asking how to use this on windows, wtf do you want a leopard update for windows in the first place? second, this is the os x file. windows can't read .dmg files. like os x can't read .exe files."
,dillzaster,2008-02-26T02:28Z,Does this work on Tiger also? Probably a dumb question..
,Badical,2008-03-25T05:32Z,"Thanks so much for this, Works awesome."
,sparrowhawk13,2008-03-30T05:09Z,"@ Ich1raku

YOU are the moron, moron.  The black MacBook has a faster processor, and it comes with a bigger hard drive.  I have a MB Pro, but still, the fact that you let your blatant ignorance run around the internet without supervision leaves me little choice but to flame your retarded ass.

@2rri  
You do not need Toast 8 Titanium to mount .dmg files.  The default Disk Utility mounts them just fine.  I suppose that's what you meant by saying that double clicking the file would open it without problem, but there are plenty of n00bs on this site that would get their knickers in a twist and go download Toast 8 for no reason.  Although, that is a GREAT program that any Mac user should already have, so maybe it wasn't such a bad idea into misleading them...."
,sparrowhawk13,2008-03-30T05:10Z,into misleading them = to mislead them
,Behzad93,2008-04-25T23:14Z,Does this work on a regular Windows-based computer?
,plykkebo,2008-05-29T20:38Z,Thanks.... Works great on MacBookPro No...problem
,x2thaz64,2011-03-02T20:38Z,serial's dont work...
,atlastone,2011-06-06T18:12Z,"Not compatible on Snow Leopard 10.6.7.
