opportunity;)"
,JayceMJ,2008-03-07T20:22Z,You sir are a saint. I will seed this torrent for as long as I exist.
,king_rat,2008-04-09T14:15Z,The Scroll of Kings is available on the p2p networks; this torrent will not be updated to include it until at least after the release of the Abyssals book.
,Lockepick,2008-04-15T17:42Z,Which p2p network are we talking about? 
,Eunomiac,2008-04-16T16:58Z,"LOVE IT! Thanks! I've been waiting a long while to complete my Exalted collection. Just to keep ourselves up to date, this is my list of oustanding 2nd ed. books not included in this torrent:

Compass of Celestial Directions Vol. 3 - Yu-Shan.pdf
Scroll of Kings.pdf
Manual of Exalted Power - Abyssals.pdf 

And upcoming (with release dates set):

Exalted: Dreams of the First Age.pdf (Apr 30)
Compass of Celestial Directions Vol. 4 - The Underworld (Jun 25)

Also..... if anyone out there has a non-locked copy of the White/Black Treatises, perhaps we could update this torrent to include it ? I'd like to fix the #@*&ing bookmark views! :-)

Thanks again for this kick-ass torrent!"
