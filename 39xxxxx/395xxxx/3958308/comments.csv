[V],joshua13,2008-01-03T06:09Z,"can you explain what you mean by this contains an invalid task? It been posted to multiple sites and is working just fine. Currently I see 102 peers and availability is up to 1.9 - expect to see some new seeders kicking in soon. If the copy form TPB is not working please come to h33t.com and get it there, and PM me there if that's what you had to do to get it to work. joshua13"
