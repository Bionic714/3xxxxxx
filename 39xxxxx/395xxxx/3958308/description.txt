Justice League III (1997-2006) pt2

The rest of this series of torrents is most easily found by going to h33t.com, although it's elsewhere also.

This is the third era of the justice league. Once again they start over with issue #1, this time simply titled "JLA"
Once again the Justice League breaks up in the end. This time it leads in to the Infinite Crisis after which, of course, it begins yet again with #1 . They just do this to manipulate you you know. They want you to think "Oh wow issue #1 - collectors item!" I can get a complete run too! It's a cheap trick! Don't go along with it. Demand your local comic shop put stickers over the issue numbers! :lol:
