Sometimes I feel like I don`t know
Sometimes I feel like checkin` out
I wanna get it wrong
Can`t always be strong
And love it won`t be long
Oh sugar, don`t you cry
Oh child, wipe the tears from your eyes
You know I need you to be strong
And the day is as dark as the night is long
Feel like trash, you make me feel clean
I'm in the black, can`t see or be seen

Baby, baby, baby...light my way
Alright now...
Baby, baby, baby...light my way

You bury your treasure
Where it can`t be found
But your love is like a secret
That`s been passed around
There is a silence that comes to a house
Where no one can sleep
I guess it`s the price of love
I know it`s not cheap

Oh, come on...
Baby, baby, baby...light my way
Oh, come on!
Baby, baby, baby...light my way

Oooh...ultraviolet...
Oooh...ultraviolet...
Oooh...ultraviolet...
Oooh...ultraviolet...

Baby, baby, baby...light my way

I remember
When we could sleep on stones
Now we lie together
In whispers and moans
When I was all messed up
And I had opera in my head
Your love was a light bulb
Hanging over my bed

Baby, baby, baby...light my way
Oh, come on...
Baby, baby, baby...light my way

Oooh...ultraviolet...
Oooh...ultraviolet...
Oooh...ultraviolet...
Oooh...ultraviolet...

Baby, baby, baby...
Baby, baby, baby...
Baby, baby, baby...light my way

Baby, baby, baby...
Baby, baby, baby...
Baby, baby, baby...light my way

Baby, baby, baby...
Baby, baby, baby...light my way
