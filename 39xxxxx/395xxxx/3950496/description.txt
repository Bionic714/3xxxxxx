Hey Everyone!

Well A New Day Means A New Torren ;)

This Time You Got A Chance To Listen (To My Opinion)

To The Best Song Ever Written "Nothing Else Matters" By Metallica

With A Unique Point Of View, A WAV File Which Contains All 6 Channels

This Means If You Have A 5.1 Audio System You'll Be Able To Hear

Each Instrument In Each Different Speaker!

I've Ripped This Track From An Original DTS Audio CD, And Now You Can

Hear This Song In A Way You Could Ever Imagined - 6 Pure Channels Which Allows

You To Hear Every Little Detail As It Was Meant To Be!!!

Just Enjoy, And Don't Forget To Share!

Thanks!
