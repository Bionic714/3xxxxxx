,senseless06,2009-04-13T00:56Z,"I'm attempting to download this torrent.. My max upload speed is 10mbit.. If you guys open up your bandwidth so I can download faster, I'll be able to get everyone else caught up faster later on. Would be nice if this torrent didn't die.

,BWear,2009-04-13T15:18Z,"Why do I get ""Permission Denied"" on this download? I'd be willing to Seed.... but I cant even start leeching :-("
,BWear,2009-04-25T14:47Z,Sorry about the noob question: I'm now leeching (& seeding) with the best of them. Hope this one doesn't stop @ 44% like the 9Gig torrent does
,elkhart7,2009-09-01T05:21Z,Seed you bastards! I'm averaging 60kbs on a 12mbs connection? Weak...
,makerof,2009-11-15T15:19Z,"Don't download this shit, half of the files are mpg's and look like they were made of 150 mb avi's: blurred all of them. With 40 gB you should at least have 350 mB avi's here, but noways, the avi's are blurred too."
,floxy5433,2010-03-28T16:54Z,"Agree with makerov, the quality is terrible.  Don't bother downloading.  Someone doesn't know how to use an encoder properly."
,DarkHill,2010-09-12T12:53Z,"Avoid!

The quality is horrible for the file-size.

The quality might be watchable for handhelds, but nothing else.

A/V: 3/3"
