,david smith,2008-01-02T21:03Z,Eng. subtitles?
,Bohasusaa,2008-01-02T21:13Z,No english subs.Plain Russian
,No_Pants_On,2008-01-02T23:50Z,Is Genghiz' lesser known brother Larry Khan in this movie?
,Kon_V_palto,2008-01-29T15:36Z,Thanks a lot)
,FidelCastroRuz,2008-01-30T16:16Z,Language: Mongolian with Russian voiceover. Only Russians can watch a movie like that. Fucking barbarians!
,WonderSlug,2008-02-25T04:54Z,"Dudes, you expected English when the Writers and Director were Russian, and the film was Russian-made?"
,carolinawolf,2008-02-25T05:11Z,hell yes we are english and give them subs dumb as
,sovk_001,2008-02-26T06:13Z,"you can get subtitles from http://www.opensubtitles.com/en/subtitles/3159455/mongol-en
Not sure if it works though"
,nador2,2008-02-27T18:01Z,"Very good film, but very bad sound version !!! The russian dubbing is very very idiotic idea !!! Only original sound version is useful, author of this rip must be russian or big sod !!!"
,ophis9,2008-02-28T13:49Z,"Fucking Russian voiceover, suxx big time"
,WonderSlug,2008-03-04T03:39Z,"Those English subtitles that sovk_001 postd the link for above work fine.

Once you download them, extract them to the same directory as the AVI.  To have DirectVobSub automatically use them, rename the .srt file to the exact same name as the .avi file."
,Stekpet,2008-04-12T23:45Z,Kill the russian guy....Kill the russian guy...kill the russian guy.....kill the russian guy...i am losing it.....This version isnÂ´t dubbed its...its...its a russian interpreter talking the whole movie... I cant believe it... Think twice before downloading. But anyway tnx Bohasusaa for the upload!!! Kill the russian interpreter....kill...kill...
,Retrospec1,2008-05-05T02:21Z,"Great movie, but the voice over really ruined it horribly, making it unwatchable.  Is there a version the voice over? just the Mongol language and English sub would be the best"
,redox1,2008-05-22T20:35Z,"Russian interpreter talking over the top of the whole movie. Agree with previous comments

Unwatchable. Dont bother"
,mapoleon,2008-06-04T12:30Z,I am so tierd of every amercian there is. Always so stupid and lazy. 
,arsenal1001,2008-06-07T01:38Z,"this is the pirate bay, not el bay de pirato, english please. the russian is an insult to genghis kahn. any other movie, maybe."
,Dirty_Pretty_Thing,2008-06-08T02:14Z,"lol, went to see it this evening in the cinema coz i couldnt find a it ANYWHERE online without the russian guy and with english subs, it either has teh russian guy or when w/o him it has random hardwired subtitles.

im too lazy, so please, someone else do it!

,jengiscan,2008-06-12T18:07Z,"Well there is a torrent on 'mybittorrent'
that claims to be an AXXO rip with english subs.
I am downloading it at the moment but I am not too sure if it is the real deal or not, the site came with the subtitles suggested above, so if any one has a faster internet connection than me(512kb)(country dweller!)check it out and let the horde know!"
,jengiscan,2008-06-13T16:18Z,"Actually the above would appear to be a scam for some DOM-X decoder bullshit, they should'nt use aXXos name in vain!!!!!!!"
,Duckiey,2008-06-13T23:09Z,"yeah
20 seconds of ""STAMP OUT THE FAKE!""
fuck shit

and by the way,
DOM-X is malware and will KILL YOUR PC

DO
NOT
GET"
,Imanu16,2008-06-24T19:45Z,I saw this movie in antwerp in the cinema. there is a version WITHOUT the goddams russian bastard constantly dubbing the voices over. I think that'll be on the dvd released in the benelux. I'll put in online as soon it comes out.
,lukelomond,2008-07-16T20:32Z,I went to see this in the cinema great film with english subs ... but that annoying russian bawbag was sitting behind me  
,SpatatGermhorn,2008-07-18T01:35Z,"""I went to see this in the cinema great film with english subs ... but that annoying russian bawbag was sitting behind me""

I hope you savaged him with your ice cream spoon,and set fire to his hair?

to russian monotone guy: next time DONT GRUNT OVER AN OTHERWISE PERFECTLY GOOD FILM! you could at least kidnap some interpreter,lock them in a cellar and force them to write russian subs for you,if your too damn lazy to write them yourself!  "

But then, most of the working class never get ""the good stuff"". They've been drinkin' some ol' rotton potato rot gut since the baby bottle, and get too crosseyed to focus on subtitles.

I'll bet that idiot providing the voice-over goes home and uses the same vocal technique while providing instructions for a better BJ to his 300 pound wife - lol...
