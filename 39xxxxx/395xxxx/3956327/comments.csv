I'm no expert, but here goes with an opinion:
Video quality: 7-8
It looks like it's ripped from a DVD or digital TV.
I'm happy."

,Hadoe,2010-05-30T08:22Z,Am I the only one who notices the size of David Bowies package in this movie?
,PoisonRequiem,2010-06-08T00:29Z,@Hadoe How can anyone not notice with all the crotch shots? His package is featured so much that it should be a supporting character with it's name in the credits; David Bowie's package.

I myself extremely enjoy almost everything that I am able to download from pirate bay I wish that i had the knowledge to seed properly however I am computer literate and very concerned about leaving my computer open for connections when I am not actively sitting in front of it if one of you gentlemen or ladies would care to help teach someone how to seed good things properly  my connection is fiber optic and very fast please email beachbum37@hotmail.com"
