This is the Saab Workshop Information System for the Saab 9-5, specific to model years 1998 and 1999.  The parts tab and most extra features are disabled, however the entire program and database of information is completely intact.  

File compressed with "Winrar".  Use Winrar to unzip upon completion.  To run the WIS, in the unzipped Saab folder click on the "Tabman" application.  Select your model year and VIN range.  You're in!  Now click on whatever category you desire to find the related workshop information.

Enjoy!
