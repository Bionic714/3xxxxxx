  Hamas - Behind The Mask

  A film by Emmy-awarding winning director Shelley Saywell, 
Hamas: Behind The Mask is a journey inside one of the world's most 
secretive and controversial political organisations. Shot during 2004 
and 2005, it documents a transformative time as Hamas entered the 
political arena, even as its main leaders were assassinated one by 
one. Interviews with leaders in hiding, militants and activists are 
juxtaposed with Israeli experts and victims, as the film examines how 
Hamas turned the once secular struggle for Palestine into a 
religiously motivated Jihad. What emerges is a portrait of a starkly 
resilient group; when thousands of their members were imprisoned they 
turned the prison into a university for ideological discourse. When 
faced with Israeli fences and lock-downs against their attacks, they 
dug underground. When their leaders were killed, their recruitment 
grew. Their popularity in the Palestinian street kept growing, in 
part because of their vast social network and in part because their 
armed resistance appealed most when public desperation was highest. 
And even though they were put on the international terrorist list by 
the US, they were able to increase their funding. On the world front, 
Hamas has become a pivotal player in any real and meaningful peace 
prospects. As Hamas now enters the political arena they face a 
strategic question. Will they play inside the box? 
Hamas: Behind The Mask is a look at the people behind the stereo-typed
terrorist mask, who have become a major force in shaping the future 
of a Palestinian state and an end to the enduring Middle Eastern 
conflict.
