,pcsinfo,2008-06-30T22:30Z,How about some gratitude for free lunch?

,zombie_bomb,2008-07-17T23:03Z,"RAAAAAH YOU MUST TELL ME THE BIT RATE BECAUSE I AM RATED R, THE BIGGEST FAGGOT IN ALL THE LAND"
,dominatus84,2008-07-22T00:17Z,"Stop dicking you guys, just check the filesize and you can see the bitrate is more than 128Kbps.

Learn to use the internets or go outside."
,Zeppoleon,2008-08-25T03:44Z,"Wow...some people are really just DICKS. anyway, thanks a lot bro"
,Rated-R-Superstar,2008-10-20T22:30Z,"You little gay bitches... Unlike you, I like my MP3 in very high quality, and it seems pretty obvious to me that the basic info you should give is the bit-rate. Zombie Bomb, I will rape your mum, again, you little homo cunt. Also you can't always tell a bit-rate from file size because you don't know how many tracks there are in this. This guy makes no effort to give any info so how the fuck do I know it's not got bonus tracks or remixes thrown in, I'm not prepared to waste my time so I'd rather be given the info that should be given. I would gladly fight the lot of you, fucking little girls the lot of you. What's the chances of that, making one comment and 5 faggots write back, disgusting!"
,BoogieJay,2008-10-27T13:14Z,"Rated-R, you are the most ungrateful douche I have ever come across. Grow up and be glad you are able to download this album at all. Oh I get it, you're just a kid and not allowed in R-Rated movies so you have to download them here..? Grow up and get a life you whiny angry fuck.
If there's no bitrate, there's no fucking bitrate... Get over it. And the only ""fucking useless moron"" is you, but you knew that..."
,ScARfaCE_43,2008-11-12T09:52Z,"@R-Rated
why are you bitching?
if you dont like it. then gtfo.
its not hard."
,navynavy,2008-11-12T19:13Z,"Rated-R,

If you click on the ""files"" link, it'll show you all the names of the files and their correlating sizes. Just compare the file size of one song to that of a song you already have of a similar time length. if you don't know how long each song is, look it up on iTunes or Amazon or Google it.
"
,navynavy,2008-11-12T19:35Z,"For instance, the song ""The Girls"" is 5:15 according to iTunes at 7.01mb. I have a Patrick Wolf song at 5:15 that has a bitrate of 160kbps and is 6.01mb. So.... this album is AT LEAST 160kbps. My educated guess would be around 192kbps. And if you're gonna whine about how that would be a waste of your time, it took ME only 30 seconds to figure it out.
If you want a more exact figure, I'm sure you can find the formula somewhere that divides the file size by seconds to get you your bitrate. Just be mindful that file sizes are always rounded to the nearest hundredth on your computer.

BTW, it's OK to ask what the bitrate is. It's NOT OK to end it with ""fucking useless moron."" Speaking of ""fucking useless morons,"" what have YOU uploaded lately, Rated-R?"
,mufuti9,2008-12-14T10:50Z,"thanks for this, good quality and very fast download!

Rated-R-Child: seriously you fail. Be grateful your parents home supports you with an internet connection so you can get this stuff at all.

Yeah that is right, you dont fooolanyone. You are just one more pre pub teen trolling the internet. Hilarious how you talk about fighting lol. You would piss your pants looking anyone of us in the eye, then run crying for your mamma who failed you so terribly.

I would like to have a talk with her, maybe it is not too late for some kicks in your still developing boy nuts."
,mzfckar,2009-03-08T21:32Z,great!
,wollygog,2009-05-10T14:26Z,"@ Rated-R-Superstar

You are probably the rudest cunt I've ever seen on here... Learn some fucking manners or switch off your shitty old pc and get back to felching your dad. Peace."
,xaized,2009-05-28T17:07Z,"THE BITRATE IS 256-320 KBPS!!!


There's a single song with 128kbps, but else it's 256 or 320 - I don't get why people can't download one of the songs and check the bitrate, it is not that difficult..."
,spingo_is_dead,2009-06-22T19:37Z,"cheers for the upload fella
rated-r you are a terrible cunt. if you like your mp3's to be of a very high quality then buy the fucking album you screeching nancy boy. as for fighting anyone who has commented. i would beat you like a ginger step shild. be ironic if you were ginger mind"
,stevieb,2009-07-19T13:24Z,"Nice post ! Thanx :D

i guess r-rated woz havin a bad lol dont we all

Keep lucky !!"
,Rated-R-Superstar,2009-07-31T00:51Z,"LMFAO! You silly little people... Oh and for the idiot who thinks he is so smart to figure out I'm a kid, sorry to disappoint but I'm 27 mate. Sorry to burst your bubble there.

All the people saying you can know the quality by the file size are retarded, it's nothing more than a bad guess going by file size. You can't account for the possibility of a VBR, which I cannot stand. Also, in order to do so to even get a rough guess I'd need to research track lenghts and I have better things to do than research track lengths, when all the uploader has to do is write one little line in the description to say the bit-rate, it's hardly difficult to do so. I think it's lazy to not do that so that people can find the torrent, and check the bit-rate and download... Boom, 5 seconds, who the hell wants to sit here and calculate shit before downloading? Answer: Nobody. I'm pretty sure everyone, even the whiners would agree that it would be easier and more user friendly to take those few seconds to write in the bit-rate.

It's funny how nobody realises how inaccurate it is to guess a bit rate from a file size, variable bit-rates suck, and I don't wanna waste my damn time downloading shit to see what bit-rate it is first when they could have been less lazy and just written it there.

Cue the whining comments from the gaylords who think they know it all... Blah, blah, blah!..."
,Rated-R-Superstar,2009-07-31T00:55Z,"Loving the hate, it's great to see how I can command such an audience with one tiny comment. I own you all. To the cuntish bitch who asked what I have uploaded lately, my answer, nothing, and never have, never will. I simply use you lot to get what I want, and I love it!

Leech, leech, leech!"
,Durial,2009-08-05T01:09Z,"Is it really that hard to put in the bitrate in details? 

It causes much less distress, checking and arguments on here."
,Rated-R-Superstar,2009-08-09T02:24Z,"Durail... At last! Someone who sees my point as to how easy it is to spend around 1 and a half seconds extra writing the bit-rate in the details!

By the way, this is bollocks quality VBR, do NOT download this heap of shit from here."
,pigsikk,2009-08-14T22:32Z,rated r u loser get a life moron
,icedeath,2009-08-23T17:17Z,"Fuck of Rated-R you little cunt.

I'm the same age as you and a boxer, you keyboard warrior.

Shut the fuck up you cunt, don't smack talk people that actually contribute to the world. You can say ""I?d fight all of you""(not that you would, because you?d get laid the fuck out)... do you have down syndrome? Do you think that situation will ever happen? You can say whatever the fuck you want, unfortunately, you're a fucking retard, and yes, you can check bit rate, so not only are you a liar, you fail at being a geek, most likely the only thing in your obese nerdy existence you have to cling on to.

Ah man, you get owned so hard, why do you even come back to this page, you just fail so hard, I see your comments and just wanna BME my face.

(although imagine it would still be better looking than you even when i'm done with it).

Hope your daddy rapes you.

P.s. get fucking laid. Nerd rage. Jesus Christ."
,Ryan_surf4life,2010-05-15T08:08Z,Look at all you cool kids fighting over torrents... but yeah it shits me not knowing the quality and as soon as you rip something it tells you straight up. downloading shit quality sucks... its not hard to tell people the bitrate when you rip something....
