,jbbbarr,2008-04-04T23:48Z,"To (macwel99), you are right about the Mac thing, that's why I have an XP box next to it for these kind of things. The problem with some of the movies is that the Mac only Recognises about 10 secs, XP is fine. For the most part the Mac will rip and burn circles around XP, granted it is an 8 core with 8gigs ram, so it's not a fair fight even for a descent server. But you get what you pay for, or not :)"
