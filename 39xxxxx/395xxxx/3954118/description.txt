River City People was a folk-rock quartet formed in Liverpool, England in 1986 by vocalist Siobhan Maher, guitarist Tim Speed, his drummer brother Paul, and bassist Dave Snell.

The group appeared on Channel 4's The Chart Show and soon afterward signed with EMI, releasing their debut single "(What's Wrong With) Dreaming?" in mid-1989. The album "Say Something Good" followed a few months later, and in the summer of 1990, the band scored their biggest hit with a cover of The Mamas and the Papas' "California Dreamin'." "This Is the World" followed in late 1991, but the group disbanded shortly after.

Maher then teamed with ex-Bangle Debbi Peterson in the duo Kindred Spirit, releasing a self-titled 1995 LP on Capitol Records. She released a solo album in 2002 called "Immigrant Flower".
