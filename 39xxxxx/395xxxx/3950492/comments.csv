,TheFirstMan,2007-12-28T14:10Z,Thank you. It says it's a DVBRip. What exactly is DVB?
,Septimus1986,2007-12-28T14:31Z,"DVB stands for Digital Video Broadcasting, it's just standard definition digital TV as opposed to HDTV. 
Is this the version aired in America or the version aired in the UK? I have heard they are different and I want to get the proper British one."
,AHH,2007-12-28T14:42Z,"@Septimus1986, it is the UK version."
,Septimus1986,2007-12-29T19:06Z,"Cool, thanks."
