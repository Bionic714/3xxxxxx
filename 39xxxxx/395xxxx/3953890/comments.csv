,mistertpitydafoo,2007-12-31T05:05Z,"It works like a dvd player if you use divx ultra compatible player or use divx's free divx ultra player. You can select multiple audio tracks and subtitle tracks. Otherwise the default audio is what you hear if you use any other programs and unless I set a subtitle as being default ""on"" you wouldn't see any subtitles, the only way to turn them on and off and switch audio tracks is using divx ultra compatible dvd player or using divx ultra free software player. It doesn't work like VCDs where one comes out the left, the other comes out the right and you choose which you want to hear. It is like a dvd how it has multiple tracks. If you use VLC for example to play this, you would see no subs since I set none as default and you would hear the 5.1 english audio, you would have to change audio tracks or view subtitles on your standalone divx ultra compatible dvd player or divx.com's free divx ultra player.  Hope this helps!"

I haven't seen this version, but Leone's earlier movies had basically all dialogue and a lot of sound effects dubbed in during post-processing. This and the limited fund that comes with being a ""B-movie"" makes the sync be less than perfect, and is probably not the encoders fault and is most likely unfixable (unless you have lots and lots of time)."
