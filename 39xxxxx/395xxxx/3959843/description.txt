Anime serie, Macross Frontier 01 (Director's Cut), so StaticAnime's ripped off translation from Shinsen Subs & the combined translation with TV-Japan release. It in 1280*720p some say it only a upscale other say it\\\'s the real thing. But it better picture & great sound it only english subs that goes for so-so karaoke no japanese lyrics only english. Still great colour subs. It the release that won't go away, it just keep getting more seeds than ever.
