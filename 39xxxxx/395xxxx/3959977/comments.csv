,vims_213,2008-01-08T12:05Z,"Hey wajdin, it does work. Install the game in setup. Then copy/paste the crack into the file directory:
Program Files/Activision/Mat Hoffmann Pro BMX.
Then press the crack button on the file ""BMX_crk""

Thx for the game blantom anyway

,timmay86,2008-03-04T03:52Z,"I was wary of downloading this because of the mention of a possible trojan but checked with ClamWin antivirus and it came back clean.  Installed flawlessly and runs fine, but I have an actual CD (downloaded this because the CD is damaged but at least still plays).  You should be able to write the files to a CD and both install and play the game just fine using that.   I haven't tried the crack, but if you just do that it should work fine."

,redfury91,2012-04-27T00:23Z,"the problem with alot of these games is that the people who make these games available like blantom here,  they give the crack a different name than the actual executable. when they do this, of course its not gonna work. because it wont replace the exe. when these morons do this shit, just go ahead and delete the original exe and drag the crack into the correct directory. also, as a failsafe, just make sure you always extract everything into the same folder. works for me nearly every single time.
