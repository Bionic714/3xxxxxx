,Ugo2,2008-11-16T14:54Z,"Great up. I use this version at college. The desktop shortcut will not work because the file path is not valid. After copying the shortcut to desktop, right click, select properties, on the shortcut tab change  target path to ""C:\Program Files\multisim\MultiSIM.exe"" including the quotes!
Next change the start in path to ""C:\Program Files\multisim"" 
This will only work if you have copied the multisim folder to c:\program files"
