,devioustexan,2008-01-01T05:14Z,Is there a full rip of this?
,cucillo,2008-01-01T17:19Z,"@ sah0714....did you get the file playing yet? I played it on windows media player but I have plenty of codecs on my cpu and honestly couldnt tell ya which is required. sorry, hope ya get it working....just a shot in the dark try loading the ac3 codec if you dont have it already.

@devioustexan....i have a full rip of the event with the english commentary but it is 2GB and that would take me 1/2 a day to up with my slow upspeed so that is why I just opted to up a few fights here and there. "
