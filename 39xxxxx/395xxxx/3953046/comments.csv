,Almarenan,2007-12-30T09:23Z,"David George Green directed one film named ""Undertow"" with the cast as listed here but it's from 2004, not 1994 :
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360130/"
,DivorcedWithChildren,2008-01-01T03:20Z,Well I could say I used the wrong date to see if anyone was noticing but . . .    You're absolutely correct.  Undertow was released in 2004 and I used the wrong date.  Jamie Bell isn't that old.  My bad.  Thanks for correcting me.  I'll be more careful in future uploads.

Re-upload it and name it correctly. It does not affect those currently downloading or seeding."
,filmlife,2008-06-08T15:32Z,"it's stuck at 95.2%
a little help, please?"
