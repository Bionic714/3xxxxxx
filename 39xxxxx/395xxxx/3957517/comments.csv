,disaksen,2008-01-02T09:56Z,Would certainly be nice for the person who upped this today to at least stick around long enough to seed it for a day or two instead of upping it and leaving without seeding.
,totalhack,2008-01-02T14:38Z,"are you serious? ive been seeding this for 9 hours and already have a 4:1 ratio. being that there is now 9 people seeding, it seems i must have been doing something right. oh and by the way your welcome.

and still seeding....."
,brianxxx,2008-01-02T15:28Z,"Is there a 2nd disk? I have learning for QB 2007 and there were 2 disks. If you have it please, post that too TH. 

And thanks for this, I was looking for it."
,roofdoc,2008-01-02T22:02Z,"I just installed and ran the program.  Everything I clicked on asked for another CD.

If you have the other CD, please post it.

TIA."
,totalhack,2008-01-03T03:34Z,"sorry everybody but the software came from the store with only one CD. but I think I figured out the problem you may be having.

After installing the software I started it up. When I clicked on a selection it prompted me to insert disk 1. I selected ""Select Training Content Location"" then used the available drop down menu to select my CD-ROM drive for where the content should be located, no actual path just the drive letter. The content then started to play and I could select any portion I wanted from that point on without any further problems.

Also as a note I tried the above procedure using poweriso to mount the image and I also used poweriso to burn the image to a cd. Both methods worked fine. Enjoy

Let me know if you all have any more problems.

brianxxx - if you could upload the 2007 version it would be much appreciated since that is the version of QB that I have.

,roofdoc,2008-01-03T05:54Z,That worked.  Thanks.  :)
,brianxxx,2008-01-04T22:16Z,"Sorry, I should have said I HAD Learning QB 2007. I deleted it a few months ago since we were going to upgrade from 2006 to 2007 but there are tremendous Vista issues with 2007. Those issues have been resolved with 2008. "
,tysonbravo,2008-05-09T05:27Z,Anybody else have problems with the audio?  Every once in a while it sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks. :(
,kessyk,2008-07-01T11:41Z,What's the problem with the audio on this file?
,eljod9,2008-08-28T07:00Z,"audio works, you just need to update flash
