Compiled from various sources, this series of CDs attempts to collect all of Paul McCartney's commercially released singles in chronological order, both A-sides and B-sides. Hope you'll enjoy this seventh and final volume.

NOTE: The other volumes have been 2 disc sets, but there's simply not enough material for a second disc this time. It's highly likely that it will be expanded at some point (whenever the next batch of singles are released). Regard this volume as a work-in-progress.
