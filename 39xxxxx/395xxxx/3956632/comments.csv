,silwon,2008-01-04T05:28Z,"The only way this torrent will ever live is if people help seed it, even if you are only getting one game,  seed it please! It will take a while to get a full torrent properly dispersed - especially if people ""Grab and Dash"" 
Again  thanks for everyone's help and have fun!"

,silwon,2008-01-14T07:18Z,"REA.CSO is Resident Evil Apocalypse UMD Video renamed to cso accidentally, i can't get it to work hopefully someone can. "
,peasplease,2008-01-27T10:29Z,"does anyone else have problems with a few of the games? these are one of the first ones downloaded.

Cars, Collapse, dinner dash, fired up, r-type, and super fruit fall. i couldnt get to load.
"
,peasplease,2008-01-27T10:41Z,oh yeah im m33 3.80. in case those games work for  the earlier firmware.
,silwon,2008-01-27T15:29Z,"peasplease, those particular roms were tested working on my 3.52 m33-4 (fat) using sony no umd in the recovery menu..hope you can get it workin' for ya."
,riva16,2008-02-18T17:06Z,Is anyone seeding this? It's been days with everyone stuck at 65%
,peasplease,2008-02-21T02:01Z,"silwon> i got it to work. i didnt realize i had to or could change the UMD mode to the Sony i was running M33.

I tested Collapse and it works now and also Dinner Dash shows up now but have not tested. DinnerDash was invisible before. I'm sure the rest i had mentioned earlier works perfectly. same with the Patapons running around. i used to get stuck at loading screen now works well."
,silwon,2008-03-07T17:35Z,"sooo... with 98.7% complete we have 14 seeds at that percentage, it has taken two months but we are almost at the finish line. please people help seed so that this torrent will live on. 
Thank you Seeders!

on another note, i previously stated that i couldn't get REA to work. I dl'd umdgen and converted the REA.CSO to REA.ISO placed the iso in the video folder of the ISO folder on the PSP, then selected no umd in the recovery menu, activated the REA.ISO in the VSH menu, inserted a UMD in the PSP drive and it worked! Resident Evil Apocalypse UMD Video! Hopefully this will help anyone else who may not know what to do (like me). 

ALSO for some reason bust a move ghost, and bust a move deluxe do not work for me, if anyone has gotten these to work please let us know what firmware/umd setting/kernel/ or whatever else you did to get it to play. i've dl'd 2-3 versions of these two games and i can't get any of them to play? I'm stumped...any help would be great. again thanks to all who help keep media available to all, for review or archiving purposes.
thanks seeders and keep a eye out for the updated version of this rompack including many more roms and smaller pre-existing rom-sizes.
i'm working on a complete rompack for the psp so if im missing any, let me know (BTW ONLY (U) or (E) regions) Thanks"
,silwon,2008-03-08T08:29Z,"okay i am stupid, i updated to 3.90 m33-2 now bust a move ghost and bust a move Deluxe work perfectly. apparently im the only person having troubles here... have fun."
,Dark_Overlord,2008-05-17T23:15Z,"http://advanscene.com/

,PrinceDastan,2010-08-22T05:39Z,SEEDERS needed !
