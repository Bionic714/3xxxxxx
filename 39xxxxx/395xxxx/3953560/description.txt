A defecting Thrush scientist informs Waverly of a Thrush poison gas project. NS and IK are sent to destroy the Thrush base in the desert. The scientist, however, flees UNCLE's care to try and get his son back from a Thrush-run boarding school in Switzerland. Big mistake. Rest of the plot concerns UNCLE and Thrush's attempts to get the boy, played by one-time Dennis the Menace Jay North.
