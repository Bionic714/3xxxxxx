,mogster82,2008-06-15T05:46Z,"Like Justeve I've been looking for this for ages. I last saw this on British TV about 15 years ago when I was 10 and it left a big impression. Not as good as 'Threads 
' though, but better than 'The Day After'."

Watched it again in the late 90's but don't know where the tape is now. Really want to watch again so thanks a lot. It was, and no doubt still is, the best of it's type."
