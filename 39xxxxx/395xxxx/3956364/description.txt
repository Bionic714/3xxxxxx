  THE FALL OF FUJIMORI

The Fall Of Fujimori chronicles the life of Peru's former President, 
and now the subject of an Interpol arrest warrant for murder and 
kidnapping, Alberto Fujimori. The Fall of Fujimori tells the story of
Fujimori's tumultuous presidency and fall from grace. Peruvian born, 
the son of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori's ethnic background was 
believed to have boosted his vote among Peru's Native Americans, 
many of whom hold a historic distrust for their countrymen of Spanish
descent. There was also an element of forlorn hope that electing 
Fujimori might bring Peru some of the economic success that made 
Japan such a powerhouse. However from his election in June 1990 to 
his resignation, faxed from a Tokyo hotel, in November 2000 it was 
not the economy but his controversial tactics in fighting illicit 
drugs and terrorism, which came to define the presidency of Alberto
Fujimori. Director Ellen Perry uses never-before seen footage from 
the regime, together with the first in-depth interview since his 
exile with Fujimori himself, to build an intimate portrait of a 
modern dictator. 
(From Peru, in Spanish, English and Japanese, with English subtitles)
