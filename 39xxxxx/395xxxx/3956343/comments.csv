,patrioticparadox,2008-10-28T06:12Z,hey shawn i have a question for you. how is it possible that you are dumb enough to post a question ON THE WRONG FUCKING TORRENT?
,patrioticparadox,2008-10-28T06:17Z,and @ F-18E google something like adding missions to FSX or manually adding missions to FSX. that out to give you your answer. but if you dont need any more detail than this (and if the zip files are organized as i think they probably are) just unzip each folder into your Flight simulator x/missions folder and they should work. if they unzip as just a bunch of loose files then you will have to manually create a folder for each of them in the missions directory. whew wasnt planning on explaining that much. hope it helps. for the future remember: google is your best friend. learn how to use it effectively
