I have never had the opportunity to upload anything of value to the FS9/FSX community here until now. I have never seen this and did a search for it and nothing like it came up. I hope someone here can find some use for this. It is not mine, I pulled it off eMule.


I am in need of some FSX files, for a book called "Microsoft Flight Simulator X For Pilots Real World Training". The book instructed you to go to a web site www.wiley.com and under the book title look for a file called "FSX Files.zip"
but the file has since been deleted.

If anyone out there has this file, would you please upload it here at TPB.

Thank you all for all of your great uploads this past year and I hope you all had a great Christmas and have a Happy New Year!
