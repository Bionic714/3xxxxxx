,Bonecrusherr,2008-01-08T09:52Z,"Strange, piratebay shows as 7 seeders, 3 leechers, but my client show as 2 seeds, 260 peers."
,TomCC,2008-01-08T21:35Z,"only seeders who are reachable (good NAT and firewall configuration and a good ISP) show up, sometimes depending on the leetchers ISP too. And if you use Azureus or ?Torrent, the DHT (or DDB) gives you additional peers regardless of tracker."
