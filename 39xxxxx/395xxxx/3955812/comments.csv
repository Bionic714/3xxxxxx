Thanks."

,uploader8,2010-04-03T17:41Z,"I have a weird problem.
when i play the file drake.and.josh.101.pilot.avi,
it plays Micheal Jackson's thriller movie.
all the other files are working properly.
Can someone please confirm whether it is a drake & josh episode or not."
,uploader8,2010-04-04T19:30Z,"When I started downloading the file drake.and.josh.101.pilot.avi and after it downloaded about 20% of the file I opened it and it played Micheal Jackson's thriller movie. When it completely downloaded the file it actually played the drake and josh episode.
This also happens in some torrents when you play half downloaded files with vlc player or any other.
Can someone please confirm this."
