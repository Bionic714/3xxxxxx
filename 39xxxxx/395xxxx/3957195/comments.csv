[T],Knaster,2008-01-01T23:18Z,The so called moonlanding with Armstrong was recorded in a studio in US. Because they were scared that the Russians would get there first

I'm sure there is PLENTY of dirt there as is always the case in massive government programs (read MONEY/CORRUPTION).  Complete mission fakery is just not factually correct.  It doesn't take long while reading through some of the nay sayers' comments (not here, of course) that they've based their conclusions and proofs on things they know nothing about.  Some fall into the category of ridiculous."

,eevee,2008-03-04T00:51Z,Here is a web page that refutes the alleged evidence that the moon landing was a hoax: http://www.braeunig.us/space/hoax.htm. You should check it out if you doubt the moon landing took place.
