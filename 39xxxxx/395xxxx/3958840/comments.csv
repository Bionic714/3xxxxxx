The Pirate Bay is excellent even to get freeware:

no hassle, and straight to the point.

Legalize it!"
,locofocos,2008-05-31T06:07Z,"Thanks for this AWESOME torrent. This is the ONLY place I could find that had MS-DOS 6.22. (there were a few other torrents, but they didn't have any seeders). Version 7.10 is for a CD and is in .iso format. Version 6.22 is 3 .img files to be put on floppies. I'll leave this seeding for a while, but if any1 really needs me to seed it, send me an email. My email is my name (line after sincerely) @gmail.com with no slashes, underscores, or anything.

sincerely,
patrickboatner"
