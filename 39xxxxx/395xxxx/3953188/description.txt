Make Cool Things with Microcontrollers

Hacking with Microcontrollers

Learn how to make cool things with microcontrollers by actually making fun projects at the Congress -- blink lights, hack your brain, move objects, turn off TVs in public places -- microcontrollers can do it all. Ongoing workshops each day of the Congress.

Learn to hack with microcontrollers! Starting with an inexpensive kit (MiniPOV, by Limor Fried, aka Ladyada), this hands-on workshop will teach you to do almost anything with microcontrollers. Throughout the days of the Congress, Mitch, the inventor of TV-B-Gone, will be giving ongoing workshops on hacking with microcontrollers. Learn to make cool devices! Projects that you can build include:

    * Make your own trippy colored-light-blinking thingy
    * Make your own device to meditate and hallucinate with brainwaves (as seen in MAKE Magazine issue #10)
    * Make your own simplified TV-B-Gone
    * Make your own bug robot that sings and dances
    * Light up and sequence EL-wire
    * Learn how to solder
    * Learn how to program with firmware
    * Learn how to use microcontroller development tools on your laptop
    * Tips, tricks, and more... All the parts you need, handouts, plus all tools will be available at the workbench at the Congress.
