,EzeRoss,2007-12-29T14:27Z,"Nicely upped, DJDave. 5 x-factor tracks on one disc. I will be trying out the first 2 and my daughter will be trying out the Leona Lewis ones. Can't say I will be trying the Shayne Ward one, though;-)

Happy New Year to you all."

Do you have 15+16?

Thanks for the up"
,djdave01,2007-12-31T19:55Z,"Sorry, i dont have 15 or 16.  I dont normally bother with these Eki's. I only got this one due to the x factor stuff being on it."
,djdave01,2008-01-01T13:18Z,"Pauuu,   i got a hold of the two you asked for EKI 15 + 16.  There now posted up on here.

Search for EKI-15    and   EKI-16

Enjoy

Dave"
