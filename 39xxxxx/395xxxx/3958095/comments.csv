[T],verifire,2008-03-10T04:52Z,"And thank you, ""tspencer"", for taking the time to saying thanks! Hope the info will do you good.. :-)"
,kayotek,2008-03-26T15:02Z,"It works even better, than it should.. But that's only my opinion. Who'd care :) It's fast, and it's working, which is most important. Thanks :D"
[T],verifire,2008-03-31T15:23Z,Better than it should.. :-) That's deep.. Isn't it? You're welcome.. :-)
,out there,2008-04-07T08:40Z,"i'm a big supporter of rand and objectivism.  it's too bad that capitalism has so many weaknesses that rand didn't predict (did she?).
this version of the book will be much easier to spread around than the tome; many thanks"
,Tophillious,2008-05-15T00:13Z,Thanks. Lookin' forward to reading this.
,Surtsey,2008-08-06T23:19Z,Thanks for the upload.
[T],verifire,2008-11-04T18:41Z,"""..supporter of Rand and objectivism.."" ""..Capitalism has so many weaknesses that Rand didn't predict.."" Please, please don't take this the wrong way, ""out there"", but I think maybe you've missed the point, and certainly haven't got the big picture and what it means to your personal freedom of choice. If your choice isn't that it's nice to be a slaving puppet for satanic, elitist, warmongering, power-drunk fascists, that is.. I hope not.. Cause that's what this book aims to educate ""the insiders"" to make you.."
,blahtsk,2008-11-29T08:40Z,"@verifire: wtf are you talking about? And what is up with your creepy book description? I googled John Todd, he sounds like a wack job just like you do.

Go outside. Throw a ball around. Get some sun."
[T],verifire,2008-12-12T22:06Z,"OK. ""LeninistStalinist"": You better read the story about who's behind every thesis, and anti-thesis which in turn leads to syn-thesis, which is the way to melt it all together until everything but being a Christian is ALL OK. Read up! Don't get stuck with the Masonic cover stories and inventions. Break the cage! You know Marx was a Mason on assignment from Rothchilds, staying at a luxury hotel in London, whilst writing ""The Manifest.."", right? Over your head? Then read up..

And..""blahtsk"". You shouldn't by any chance be a fan of ""Madame"" Blavathsky? In which case I think you should stop playing around with what ever you do, and go out side and, literally instead of figuratively, throw a ball around. Preferably on a field with nobody around..

What's with me? I believe in Jesus.. So did John Todd. You trying to discredit a man who was jailed, doped and finally killed for revealing information about his former ""brothers"" in Illuminati, is just pathetic. Sharpen your weapon if you want to fight my knowledge about things like these. Childish, personal slandering and mockery just won't do it. Period.

By the way: Why are you so interested and provoked by what I say, that you resort to ""comments"" like the ones above? Please don't answer that, unless you plan to answer truthfully.."
,Sprite0,2008-12-26T05:04Z,"LeninistStalinist is a retarded little spammer unworthy of as much attention as a cockroach, who is his intellectual superior.  (Hey, at least a cockroach can survive without throwing other cockroaches in the gulag!)

Atlas Shrugged is probably the greatest American novel of the 20th century, but you should keep in mind that it was written to explore and present philosophical, political, and aesthetic ideas.  If you want a psychological drama look elsewhere.  Rand's books are best experienced in this order: first the non-fiction to get a more condensed understanding of her philosophy, then the fiction works in order: Anthem, We The Living, The Fountainhead, and finally Atlas Shrugged.  The greatness of this book is also in that it is a prediction for the 21st century's economic decline caused by socialist governments, and a manual of resistance."
,RavenVanya,2009-02-02T12:47Z,"Hey chudddds, do the world a favor and choke to death on your own tongue. Please.

You God damn Scab.  "
[T],verifire,2009-07-15T11:41Z,"@""sprite0"": ""The greatness of this book is also in that it is a prediction for the 21st century's economic decline caused by socialist governments, and a manual of resistance.""

Well isn't that amazing!? Create chaos, present the ""solution"", that ""we, the people"", shall be our own masters and masters of our destiny. What does not become obviously clear in Alisa Zinovjevna Rozenbaums.. ehmm... I mean of course her witchcraft name Ayn Rands book, is that the ""solution"" is a carefully planned, but concealed, Globalism, and the preparation for such a clandestine takeover.

Anyone with just a little knowledge of the occult and who they are and what their goals are, and also their symbolism. Just look at the US stamp on top of this page. Of course, like  say, you need to know something about the whole picture, and not be completely dazzled by how for instance; she ""predicts"" the economic decline..  I think it was President ""Teddy"" Roosevelt that said: ""There are no coincidences in politics. If something happens, you can be pretty damn sure it was planned that way.""

Well, may the light of the only Saviour shine upon all our hearts and minds so we can see clearly and remain so until He comes in the skies.. :-) "
,ButterBricks,2009-08-02T12:00Z,"I think there is more going on in this novel then what can be immediately observed. 

Verifire, Care to enlighten us a bit more about this book's purpose ?
 - Why not also, in time, put a torrent together in which we can learn a little more about your views ? "
[T],verifire,2009-08-04T12:09Z,"@""ButterBricks"": Well, why not.. I'll tell you what: I appreciate that someone knows there's something ""rotten in the state of Denmark"" to quote the son of a glove-maker in Stratford-upon-Avon, who had amazingly much knowledge at the time on matters of Greek philosophy and mythology and rules of state and so on, the highly revered ""Shakespeare"", or, as I like to refer to the source of these plays: Sir Francis Bacon, who are depicted on a stamp, much like the one of Ms. ""Rand"", as being; quote: ""The Spirit Behind The American Revolution"", even though he had been dead for 150 years when it happened.. You do the math..

Listen: ""My views"" are not hidden. They become obvious in the introductions and comments I post.
Would I like to have a sect named after me? No thanks.. :-)

To profile me; Cut and Paste.. :-)

Jesus Christ has ALL the answers. All I can see are bits and pieces, until the day comes when I shall meet him face to face in the sky.
In the meantime, I'll keep on doing what I do, and I mean to do it for Him. That's my view.. :-)"
[T],verifire,2009-08-04T13:11Z,"PS: I mean no offense to the nice people of Denmark in the comment above, of course, it's just an expression from ""Hamlet"", but you probably knew that.. :-)

I should perhaps add that it means something like ""something smells fishy here"" or ""there's a dog buried somewhere"", but I don't have the sources for those quotes.. :-)"
,TheColdTruth,2009-09-07T13:01Z,"Wow, level of stupidity on this torrent is epic.

Atlas Shrugged is the most rational and good book to exist today.

Capitalism is what it is in itself; the practice of men to trade goods among themselves without government control, and without the threat of force.

Do you get that?  Capitalism is not imperialism.  Capitalism is not legislating the middle class out of existence.  Capitalism is not consumerism.  A is A, and can only be A.  If any of you marxist twats had bothered to read this book instead of bleat endlessly, you'd know this."
,Dottodot,2009-12-16T21:25Z,"From the ""Update:,"" in the description:

Some people have called this introduction of mine ""creepy"". Either they don't like anything that's not nice and sunny and in line with: ""there's nothing going on here, people, just move along.."", or they feel personally threatened by it..

It must be one or the other?
I admire your ability to simplify unlimited possibilities into two possible reasons. I imagine it is that black and white, two dimensional thinking that allows one to live in a reality such as yours. 
I am unable to reduce such vast unknowns into bite sized rationalizations.  There is ""simply"" too many variables that are ever evolving.
I thank you for your time to upload this information, I look forward to learning of this much hyped perspective.

,anay,2010-02-08T01:49Z,"hey thanks for the upload!!!! it's just great. already purchased the book, but wanted it on my laptop to read! i have a question bout Norway though! is it really all metal music wise? cause i live all the way down in india and am just curious!!!! lol! XD"
,Brindleman,2010-02-09T21:03Z,"Wow, if this book causes this much debate, then it has just become a ""must read"" for me.  LOL."
[T],verifire,2010-05-01T03:29Z,"Let me make this even more plain: Personally I'm thinking that the people who writs so passionately about this book and its significance, probably wouldn't know a rotten apple if they had one for breakfast. That's the way it goes when you get used to it. Herd-mentality is another word that springs to mind.

And I only wanted to honour a man who actually got killed for telling the story of his life, and the things he had been taught from, amongst other, this book.

But, like I say, you have to know of and about the occult to make a statement, like for instance about the ""stamp"" on top of this page. To an initiate it's obvious. To the ignorant or scared or deliberate deceiving ones, it's nonsense..

And I'm supposed to listen to such crap as ""Don't see the FNORD""?

How about: Get your glasses on and see? How about: Try to see it before it's too late?
And: Choose today who you'll serve; God or this worlds ""god"" and his puppets..

Sometimes I wonder why I even bother, but then I think of the one here, one there, that actually get it. That's enough.."

,Frankbmaster,2010-06-26T20:22Z,"John Todd .. Did he ever get out of Jail from those Rape convictions in south Carolina ? Say What you want about Ayn Rand, But she never did Time for Child Rape."
,jurviz,2011-07-06T09:36Z,"Well, the ""introduction"" by this Todd guy is absolutely ridiculous. Truly the rantings of a madman. Now we'll just have to see whether the actual book is on a similar level.

I mean, what are these idiots thinking? They go on these idiotic rants and ravings, and then when people laugh at them, they just think everyone is a part of this conspiracy against them? How can people be this stupid?

Well, he was a minister, and the rant was made in a church, so I guess that explains at least some of it."
,lol9765,2012-05-01T18:58Z,Awful book. Ayn Rand clearly could not write! I was bored out of my mind reading it.
