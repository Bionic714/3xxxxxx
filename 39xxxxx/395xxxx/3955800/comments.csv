,malagent,2008-01-25T06:19Z,"Can someone who has downloaded (or posted) this let me know which build of Mac OX X 10.3 this is?

I've purchased retail boxed versions of every Mac OS release since 7.6 - i just like to have as recent of an installer as possible, such as 10.3.9 rather than the 10.3 that came in the box.

The original retail 10.3 is build 7B85, I believe the latest retail build is 7D28 and 10.3.9 is 7W98.

I'm DL'ing anyway so I guess if it finishes before an answer comes I'll post what I find."

,ToniMcGuire,2008-07-09T21:22Z,"I'm having trouble getting Disk 1 to boot on my slot loading iMac G3 or iBookG4.  I see the grey screen, the apple logo, then the spinning thing.  But then the apple logo turns to a circle with a slash through it.  If anyone has any tips, I'd be grateful!

I have tried downloading and re-downloading several torrents in different formats (.dmg . toast .iso).  I've tried burning them with toast, DiskUtility and even some utility on a windows computer.

I verify each burn, so I don't think it's the burner / media.  Would it help to convert the image to CD/DVD Master in Disk Utility?  Any tips would be great!  So many coasters!

The G5 is the fifth generation of the Power PC processor, an IBM one if I'm not mistaken. the Core 2 Duo is an x86 processor, made by intel, and OS X 10.3 will NOT work on it."

I downloaded Mac OS X 10.2.0 ( Jaguar) and installed perfectly, using TransMac To Burn The Disc's on Windows since the iMac G3 does not burn CD's (Bought a Macbook Pro 2.5 Ghz , It arrived today and burned them again just in case, made 2 copies of each disc). This Torrent Burn and booted Perfectly the first Disc, seems I have to wait until I get more ram ! Will Post when they arrived! ( I dont even think of trying this out on my new Mac! jajaja)

,geebbes13,2009-01-27T07:02Z,"Beautiful install, here's a quick guide if your lost when trying to burn from a PC.
1. Check this out, it will explain pretty much everything
http://www.computing.net/answers/mac/dmg-without-os-x-using-a-pc/10311.html
2.
The file with the broken link (dmg2iso) can be found here: 
http://vu1tur.eu.org/tools/
3.
To use dmg2iso you must run a cmd window, drag the dmg2iso.exe program you just downloaded into the command window to quickly set up the path for the program. Follow that with the  os x dmg's paths one at a time. A basic example, your root paths will vary  ---
""D:\Documents...\Downloads\Firefox\dmg2iso\dmg2iso.exe ""D:\macosx10_cd1.dmg ""D:\macosx10.3_cd1.iso
4.
Burn your iso with nero, or whatever, as images and install on your mac (G3-G5 supported)"

,Artless,2009-03-04T11:26Z,"2 questions:

1: What is Xtools?

2: I downloaded, unpacked the 3 dmg's (on an iBook G4) and burned it also on the G4. When i boot from the CD a folder with a question-mark appears and after some time the computer just start normally. I have also tried running ""Install Mac OS X"" when I'm in the Finder and it asks to reboot and the exact same thing happens...

Help please (I of course am seeding)
Oh and by the way the reason for all this is that i am trying to reformat my iBook G4 to have a fresh start but i lost the cd's that came with it long ago..."

,nitrous9200,2009-08-07T06:07Z,"it won't install on my iMac G3 (previous owner upgraded to 10.2 without updating firmware, so that's as far as I can go) but it does boot, used dmg2iso to convert and burned with ImgBurn. Thanks a lot."
,nitrous9200,2009-12-12T03:45Z,"Update: updated my firmware, Tiger won't install on my iMac G3 DV SE 500MHz, but this copy of Panther works fine. For best results, burn on a Mac or use PowerISO trial on Windows. You don't even need to convert the dmg; powerISO can handle it natively. Just be sure to burn at the lowest speed and verify after burning. Great torrent, seeding this."
,i-like-macs,2010-01-08T13:56Z,can i spread this out across a few cds or do i need to wite the program to a single diski need to know asap any info appreciated :P
,oblivion233,2010-01-22T10:00Z,"Here is how to install this on an iMac G3: (Instructions based off of an intel-based mac)
Please note that I am a mac-user. I am using my awesome 2006 intel iMac to burn the discs.

1. Download dmg2iso (google it. Sourceforge.)
2. Open dmg2iso
3. Drag the DMG file from disc 1 (mac-x3a.dmg) into the dmg2iso window
4. Wait a few seconds. It did not freeze. It took up to a minute to work.
5. Go into the CD1 folder.
6. Double click 'mac-x3a.dmg.cdr to mount it.
7. When locating files to burn in your favourite CD burner, choose the dmg.cdr (mounted) that appears under your MAC HD when browsing. It should have a picture of a white hard disk.
8. BURN.
9. Read step 10
10. To burn all 3 disks, use the same proccess."
,oblivion233,2010-01-22T10:01Z,"Important notice:
When using the disks with the iMac G3, insert the disk, restart the computer and right when it turns back on...even before it boots...hold down C until the mac os x setup appears."

,zedcyborg,2010-11-13T22:00Z,"1. Each dmg file has to be burnt onto a seperate CD preferably. 

2. But if your Imac has a dvd drive then you can burn them on seperate dvds

3. You can use the program from Acute Systems TRANSMAC which can burn any dmg to CD/DVD

4. Find the TRANSMAC program here, @ TPB

5. You may have to burn a CD 2 times for a proper copy & @ VERY low speeds for safety

6. Steps for reinstall OS:  http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/installing-or-reinstalling-mac-os-x-panther.html"
,crazyace87,2010-11-25T09:24Z,"This Torrent Works! I followed zedcyborg directions, and installed it on an old PowerBook G4. TransMac is awesome software, if you don't have it you need to get it. This process is just step one, I have MacOSX 10.4 Tiger Upgrade to install next. Thank you mm3_hellraiser for the upload!"
,7sd3,2010-12-13T01:08Z,"After much research and failed attempts, this finally worked for me. 

I got it to burn on a Windows 7 machine using Nero 9.

Convert dmg to img:

1) Download ""dmg2img"" from http://vu1tur.eu.org/tools/

2) Unzip files. Copy the following files:
-dmg2img.exe
-mgwbz2-1.dll
-mgwz.dll
Copy the files to each folder: CD1, CD2, CD3

This will make it easier to run the program. 



3) Read the ReadMe.txt file from the dmg2img website. 

4)open a command terminal in Windows. 

-Windows 7: just type ""Cmd"" in start menu. Right click on it and ""run as administrator"".

-Previous windows: go to run and type ""cmd.exe""

5) navigate to the folder containging CD1 (later do CD2 and CD3). 
Type ""dmg2img -i  -o ""

Leave out the < and > signs. 
Example: 

dmg2img -i mac-x3a.dmg -o mac-x3a.img

Do this for CD2 and CD3 as well.

6) Burn the img file with Nero or similar program. Nero 9 worked for me. It burned the hfs partition perfectly fine.

,CeSaR_74,2011-03-14T01:01Z,"If you're trying to burn the .dmg files on Windows just download and use a program called ""PowerISO"". It supports burning .dmg files on Windows. That's what I did and it worked great. 

Thank you mm3_hellraiser! you're a lifesaver!!!"
,ffuentes_1,2011-11-30T20:37Z,"It worked out!

I'm using Linux to burn and I had to install acetoneiso."
,twodfx,2012-05-30T03:46Z,Doesn't appear to be bootable unfortunately...
