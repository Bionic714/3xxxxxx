About Dntel.

Tamborello [Dntel] first began creating music in 1989, when he was in Junior High School in Santa Barbara, California. His father â?? a jazz saxophone player and flautist â?? bought Tamborello a drum machine, a sequencer, a keyboard and an eight track recorder, primarily for the possibility to create music on his own. He was a key songwriter for many Santa Barbara bands including Skillet, Chia Band, and Monkeydogg (with David Figurine, Lael "Scraps" Waqeneck, and Marc Hawthorne of the Onion A/V Club). He recorded an album under the pseudonym Antihouse in 1993, and released it in 1994. He began work on the first Dntel EP in 1994, which was not released until later. During these years, Jimmy was a DJ at KXLU, and engineered on several albums recorded at the station including "KXLU LIVE: Volume 1"

Around 1994, Jimmy Tamborello was also the bass player for a band known as Strictly Ballroom. The band was often described as "Enocore," for the way it fused hardcore punk rock with soundscapes inspired by Brian Eno. Strictly Ballroom recorded one album, titled Hide Here Forever, which was released in 1997 on the Waxploitation Records label.

A collection of the demos during the period of 1995-1997 titled Early Works for Me If It Works for You (1999) was released on the label Phthalo. The work on the first Dntel EP was released as Something Always Goes Wrong (2000), also on the Phthalo label.

As a pioneer of contemporary glitch and electronica, Dntel gained a cult following. After writing a track for the Voices In My Lunchbox collaboration for the Plug Research label, he was asked to work with them. He first released Anyone Anywhere (2000), a 12-inch EP.

He released his full-length album Life Is Full of Possibilities (2001). The album featured several guest artists on vocals, guitars and other instruments, including Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie, Mia Doi Todd, fellow Figurine member Meredith Figurine, Chris Gunst of Beachwood Sparks, Brian McMahan of Slint and The For Carnation, and Rachel Haden of That Dog. Probably the most well-received song was the Ben Gibbard collaboration "(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan", which led to a single in 2002, and later, the forming of the band The Postal Service with Ben Gibbard. Tamborello is also credited for programming "Take It Easy (Love Nothing)", a Billboard chart topper for Bright Eyes.

On April 24th 2007 Dntel released his third album Dumb Luck on Subpop Records to generally positive critical reception. Dntel is currently working with Ben Gibbard on the next Postal Service album.

Tamborello is also the host of a regular music show called "Dying Songs" heard on the internet radio station dublab
