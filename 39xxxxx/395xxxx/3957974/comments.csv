By the way, I checked a number of completed tracks and the info about artist for most of them are in the tag info and the bitrate seems to be 192kbit/sec."

i leave this seeding whenever i am not using pc for my own things,so if you think its slow ,download it elsewhere,.just be happy you are getting something for nothing,,,,
it would help if all those people who have downloaded, seeded."
