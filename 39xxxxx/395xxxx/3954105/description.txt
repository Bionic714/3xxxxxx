Stiv Bators and His Evil Boys - Live at the Limelight, Jan 1988.  Aside from Stiv, the band features Danny Nordahl who was also bass player in The Throbs.

Good mix of old and new songs from all parts of Stiv's career (aside from Lords of the New Church, but he was probably still smarting from their ill-hatched plan to sack him as lead singer . . . ) - some Dead Boys classics, some solo stuff, a track from the Wanderers LP and a couple of newies that he still hadn't released when he died.

Enjoy.
