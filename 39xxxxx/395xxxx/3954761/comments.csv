Major mistakes:
Sura 083: Al-Motafifeen
Sura 104: Al-Homazah
Sura 062: Al-Jomo3ah

Minor mistakes:
Sura 005: Al-Ma'idah
Sura 069: Al-7aqqah

,halykins,2008-07-05T23:32Z,"Just a note...this does not seem to be read in the English language.  Since all the comments, title and the files reads English, I thought it would be read in English also."
,ai82517,2009-10-09T09:30Z,"@rdion you are a hypocrite. @entee just thanked you for providing the torrent, and you tell him to get lost. Is that what the Quran or Islam teaches you? Did Allah inspire to you that @entee was not here for the Holy Quran? It is none of your business to check what other's intentions are. Allah is the All-Knowing, The Merciful.
