This is the latest World of Warcraft modelviewer (0.5.09) including the latest Item List (2.2).

The World of Warcraft modelviewer is a tool for World of Warcraft. It can be used to show all the items and creatures in the game, and you can for example see how your character will look in full tier 6.

If you combine this tool with "My Warcraft Studio" you can also make it look like you are wearing ex. full tier 6 in game (only visible for you though).

Enjoy.
