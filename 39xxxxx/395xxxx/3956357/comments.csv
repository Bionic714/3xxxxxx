,_Nutshell_,2008-01-01T13:34Z,How is the quality on this one compared to the videos on youtube?
,ripmixburn,2008-01-01T17:28Z,This is an mp4 file... any lineage info?
,Genglefins,2008-01-02T05:59Z,Can somebody please seed? I'm stuck at 87.7% and will gladly seed once I reach 100%
,motorollin,2008-01-02T12:47Z,"I am also stuck, at 96%. Please could somebody re-seed and I will do likewise once I have the whole file."
,morenone,2008-01-02T14:46Z,"Try this one

,motorollin,2008-01-02T14:56Z,Got the whole thing now. Quality is great. Reseeding for you guys who are still waiting.
,Genglefins,2008-01-04T11:34Z,"Finally got the whole file. Just want to note that the video starts with the Radiohead ""Scotch Mist""  special, then it ends and two Douche bags talk for a while and they show a video for The Shins, chat a little more, then repeat the Scotch Mist show. In other words, this file is has the Radiohead show on it twice. FYI. "
