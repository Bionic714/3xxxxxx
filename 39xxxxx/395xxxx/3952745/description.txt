What people say about it:

\"Wow, this is quite the amazing video. The way the music fit with the scenes is spectacular. And Rory\'s face at the end was simply amazing, I hadn\'t noticed that the about 20 times I watched the movie. Bravo, Bravo, greatly done. =]\"

\"Omg, this is so beautiful, what amazing job, the music matches well.\"

\"Wow, it looks beautiful and I loved Rory\'s close up, but my favorite is when Josh was yelling \"Daddy splatters his brains all over the wall\" and Marty came after him and Rocky pushed him over or everything to do with Sad Clyde. Ooh, I should listen to the commentary. *runs off to do that*\"
