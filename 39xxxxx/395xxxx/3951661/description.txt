               Album Info..:                                                                   
                                                                                               
          James Taylor had scored eight Top 40 hits by the fall of 1976 when Warner Brothers   
          marked the end of his contract with this compilation. One of those hits, the Top Ten 
          gold single "Mockingbird," a duet with his wife Carly Simon, was on Elektra Records, 
          part of the Warners family of labels and presumably available, but it was left off.  
          "Long Ago and Far Away," a lesser hit (though it made the Top Ten on the Easy        
          Listening charts) wasn't used either. In addition to the six hits -- "Fire and Rain,"
          "Country Road," "You've Got a Friend," "Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight," "How Sweet  
          It Is (To Be Loved by You)," and "Shower the People" -- that were included, the album
          featured a couple of less successful singles, "Mexico" and "Walking Man," the album  
          track "Sweet Baby James," and three previously unreleased recordings -- a live       
          version of "Steamroller" and newly recorded versions of "Something in the Way She    
          Moves" and "Carolina in My Mind," songs featured on Taylor's 1968 debut album,       
          recorded for Apple/Capitol. The result was a reasonable collection for an artist who 
          wasn't particularly well-defined by his singles. One got little sense of Taylor's    
          evolution from the dour, confessional songs of his first two albums to the more      
          conventional pop songs of his sixth and seventh ones. But one did hear isolated      
          examples of Taylor's undeniable warmth and facility for folk/country-tinged pop. By  
          the next summer, Taylor was back in the Top Ten on Columbia, and Greatest Hits was   
          out of date. But it remains a good sampler of Taylor's more popular early work. And, 
          decades later, it remained the only Taylor compilation in print in the U.S.
