I have been looking for this DVD and finally download it and enjoy it.
Thanks."

,Fixxxer83,2009-03-29T21:46Z,"glammaniac: 

you can compress it with dvdshrink 'til 5.5 approx

Then you can use DVDFabPlatinum... that's for erase logos and warnings and some innecesary audio (for example Dolby Stereo)

hope it may help you ans sorry my bad english"
