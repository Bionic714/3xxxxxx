,stenare,2010-02-26T08:23Z,"Grammar dude, grammar...

""Many of this"" should be ""Many of these"".
There's a subtle difference you know...

""This"" implies one, singular. Eg: This is mine
""These"" implies several, plural. Eg: These paintings are mine.

The description should start with ""This is a bunch of filmclips"", and last sentence ""These clips are in MPEG4""."
