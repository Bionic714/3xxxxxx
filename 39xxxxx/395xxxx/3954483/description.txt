J K Rowling: a Year in the Life (ITV1)

In 2007, Harry Potter fans across the world were beside themselves with anticipation over the publication of the seventh and final book in the phenomenally successful series. This documentary reveals how author JK Rowling coped with the weight of such high expectations - and the prospect of saying goodbye to her most famous creation - by following her as she completes work on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Cameras also chart the progress of the finished article as it is delivered in a locked suitcase to her agent at Heathrow Airport, and the battle to keep the contents secret before the official worldwide release on July 21. When she's not slaving over a hot keyboard, JK finds time to show viewers some of the places which inspired her work, including the Forest of Dean, King's Cross station, Castle Duart on the Island of Mull and the Great Hall of Christ Church College in Oxford. The film-makers also take her on a sentimental journey to revisit her childhood home for the first time.
