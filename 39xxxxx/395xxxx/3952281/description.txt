Tonnes of energy to burn here people... EXCELLENT pick-me-up conversion of the original, and wonderful style of Electro Clash.


I have been paying attention to everything that Klaas is doing having backtracked and checked all their remixes and productions... and I am ever so impressed.  We will be seeing more of Klaas on my 2008 line up.




Enjoy and please seed.
