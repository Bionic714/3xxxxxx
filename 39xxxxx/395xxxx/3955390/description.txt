Finally, the public version of Alchemy. 
I wouldn't call it final but if you define final as "we won't touch it anymore and don't care if it is buggy",
they yes this is final. Sveasoft didn't even bother to release a changelog so I doubt any remaining bugs will be fixed by them.
This firmware is for WRT54G V1.0, V1.1, V2.0, V2.2 and WRT54GS V1.0, V1.1 routers only.
WRT54G v3.0 and WRT54GS v2.0 are NOT supported, however some users of v3.0's are reporting it does work.
