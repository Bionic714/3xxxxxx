Plot Outline: After three rowdy guys get booted from their frat house, they dress up as women and pledge the \"ugly girl\" sorority, where they figure they\'ll blend right in. In their new environment, the men relinquish their frat mentality and realize how hurtful they have been to women over the years. When their less-than-stunning female forms earn them an invite to a \"dog catcher\" party at their old frat, they decide to brave the harassment so they can grab the rest of their belongings from the house and make a clean break.
