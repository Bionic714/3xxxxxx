,JonnyDr,2008-01-09T21:38Z,"Will do in a bit mate, but I left it for 4 days and people hit and ran, so unfortunately you'll have to wait a bit. It WILL get finished though, so don't fret about that."
,Boltie,2008-01-23T14:25Z,"I started this torrent on the 7th and it's still not complete. It's said it has had a seeder every time I check, so why is there about 25 of us stuck on 96.9%? Please could you seed this just for another hour. If not, at least let us know you're not going to bother. Thanks anyway."
,JonnyDr,2008-01-24T16:16Z,"Listen mate, I've seeded this for almost 10 24-hour days in total. People have finished and fucked off as soon as they have so it's only them you have to blame. And believe me, another hour ain't gonna do it. You will get it finished, but I also release to places where people actually care about seeding, and at the moment, they're taking priority."
,Boltie,2008-01-24T22:11Z,"I wasn't having a go at you, just couldn't understand why it was taking so long as I kept seeing a seed. I hate public trackers myself, never use them except when it comes to flac. Can't find flac much on the private trackers I'm on. Is there any way to private message people on here?"
,Boltie,2008-01-24T23:39Z,Cheers for the info and thanks for the seed. It's a great album.I'll seed this to at least 2.5 once I have this. :D
