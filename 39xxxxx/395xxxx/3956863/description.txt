>From ericburdonalbums.com: This rare album is a collection of tracks from English groups produced by Mickie Most who first brought Herman's Hermits and The Animals to the attention of the world. In this album, Metro not only provided first cut tunes by these two groups, but also the sounds of three new groups at that time (The Moquettes, The Cherokees, and The Symbols). This album was a re-issue of the USA 1965 album "Mickie Most Presents British Go-Go"<

If you're looking for audiophile quality, look elsewhere! Apart from removing the "big pops" and coinerting the L & R channels into 1 channel, I have left this album untouched.  You will hear some clicks, but nothing that should detract from your enjoyment(except maybe some of the music itself!)of a record that is 41 years old. 

The album itself is a reissue of a prior album, and it sounds like it was hastily mastered (check out the level drop in "You Came Along").  That said, it is a unique slice of British Invasion history, and probably the only place you will find tracks by The Symbols, The Cherokees, and The Moquettes.
