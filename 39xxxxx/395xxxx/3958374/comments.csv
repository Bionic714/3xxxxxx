,isomyy,2008-01-05T22:14Z,"errors during install are probably due to missing firmware directory in /lib/firmware, there should be at least one directory already from your current kernel. Create a symblic link from that to this new kernel: eg:
cd /lib/firmware
ln -s ""current_kernel_ver"" \ 2.6.24-rc6-powerpc64-smp-custom

Boot problem: You need updated boot image, I am using this:
