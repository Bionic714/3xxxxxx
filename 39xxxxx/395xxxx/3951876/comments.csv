,jim4,2007-12-29T19:38Z,I suppose all the dead sea scrolls are works of fiction also.  Glad we are spending so much money on our school systems.
,teesy,2007-12-30T19:41Z,"read the bible dude
that god guy is a real sicko,if they made the film the way its wrote there it would be banned.
its just some dummas arabs,who don,t know fuck playing in the dirt and afraid of the dark.just like you"
,teesy,2007-12-30T19:43Z,"hope i didn,t offend anyone by the way"
,Crawling_Chaos007,2008-01-25T17:15Z,You will think different when your about to die...if you have time for thought. Oh yes indeed.
[T],Knaster,2008-01-25T21:49Z,PhXAnarchy its more like Hitler was better than Jesus. Jesus was a fag
[T],Knaster,2008-01-25T21:50Z,Great movie though with the rightwing nutjob Charlton Heston. 88
,aleksbmk,2008-03-23T18:19Z,"thanks JayRay for this movie and for the others like this , only the fools here don`t appreciate the trouble to make such an upload "
,itwiz90,2008-03-23T20:23Z,"Infidels....its just a movie, yes highly speculative, and not too historically accurate (ie; The crossed at the Sea of Reeds not the Red Sea - misinterpeted).
The acting was great even though over the top on occassion. Yul, is the man though a ham he was still at his best.
All you ZeiGeist fans need to go back to school or spend some time in your local library and do some history research, that video was off on a lot of things, sometimes we have to see for ourselves."
,JadMock,2008-03-24T23:33Z,"Lol love this movie but I am such a blasphemer and hypocrite of one of the ten commandments is Thou Shall Not Steal, (cough, cough) my bad"

,master_b415,2008-07-18T02:56Z,"Good stuff coming fm u. This rip is no exception, well done. Thank you."
,SpikeShellMagnet84,2008-08-17T21:48Z,You who are talking badly of God had better be sure what you believe in.  Blasphemy of God is not something He will take lightly when you die.
,SpikeShellMagnet84,2008-08-17T21:49Z,"@Jadmock, yeah I know what you mean, stealing movies....Sorry God! Great classic movie btw, thanks Jayray!"
,canthisreallybetheend,2008-09-07T14:43Z,"whatever, spike. at least you'll have the bad guy on your side, while god is supposed to be good and consequently can't be that ""bad"" of an adversary. he's a sissy, as he'll forgive us anyway. (irony alert)
looking forward to seeing it! thx."
,spamme,2008-09-24T19:52Z,"Great upload, where can I find the Dutch sub for this one"
,wfbauerle,2008-10-01T02:27Z,"With all the things that are happening in the world now, these people still mock God and Jesus? I think if you non-believers would take the time to actually read the bible and the prophecy of the end times you might well have some fear and respect for God instead of Blaspheming.

Oh well, the end times are just like the flood of Noah, people will go about their lives unaware until the flood comes and takes them away (Figuratively speaking)"
,mafre029,2008-11-16T16:11Z,"hey phxanarchy,  Who did moses or jesus ever Kileld. Mosses free a whole people from slavary and jesus freed a whole world from slavary who did you ever free"
,robojohn,2008-11-25T03:42Z,Damn.  Tons of bible movies produced and this is one of the only films anyone ever cared about.  Respect.  Atheist here.
,kumasta,2008-12-09T10:28Z,some of you have shown your HATRED of your fellow man. Because of people like you our country is down the shitter. How do you think any country can stand with the kind of morality you have? This is a forum to comment on a movie concerning quality etc. Not for inhuman remarks.
,harigata,2009-02-23T17:23Z,A decidedly inspiring piece of shit.
,harigata,2009-02-23T17:26Z,"Robojohnny-
It takes humans to make inhuman remarks.
And to behave inhumanely.
Animals just fucking can't."
,L-310,2009-03-25T09:20Z,Thanks for sharing!!
,Shadeztreez,2009-04-18T09:10Z,Judge not least ye be judged... The thing about being human we have the choice... Take care of the splinter in your own eye before you focus on the splinter in thy brothers eye...
,jonasfromCanada,2009-09-15T05:27Z,"I intend to let my kids watch this movie to help instill moral values like ""thou shalt not steal""... 
...by stealing!  

for all of you religious people out there,
 is this wrong?  
         and if so, 
it's straight to hell for you too since you were going to steal this movie too!  Don't try to talk your way out of it! God is watching you!!

Arrg!  I love pirate bay!"
[T],IndianChristian,2009-12-06T19:31Z,Thanks for this one.

,biblecodereader,2011-01-18T23:19Z,thankyou.. download time about 1hr... film quality good... sound good...  was worth the time
,Tamarind777,2011-01-20T05:26Z,All of you who write crap knocking the Bible are just plain against it because it makes more sense than your stupid evolution religion. Try learning some real science and history. God will one day judge you all and you don't need to believe in Him for it to happen either! Keep living in sin. One day soon you WILL pay for it and your stupid blasphemous comments.
,jayslay2000,2011-02-13T12:50Z,thanks great movie love to watch during easter
,nickguyatt,2011-08-05T14:50Z,"Personally I find many of the above comments, both pro- and anti-christian, to be somewhat ridiculous. If you're a Christian then presumably you will enjoy this film as a wonderful dramatization of a beloved Biblical story, If like myself you are an atheist (for which I make no apology whatsoever) then it is simply a wonderful mytho-historical epic. Either way it is a great film and well worth watching, I myself first saw this film as a child and I am looking forward to watching it again. On a final note I would just like to point out that the comments section on a torrent website is intended for messages pertaining to the content, and quality thereof, of the torrent not for indepth theological discussion. Thank you, dissertation over."
,lilluther,2011-09-15T20:54Z,"A most wonderful and aspiring Motion Picture which tells the true account of the deliverance of the Hebrew people. The Ten Commandments which many nations of today take their laws from, was true then, now and will stand in the future. Whether you believe in it or not, the message still stands, ""Those who do not live by the law shall die by the law"" And the judgement God of Abraham for all people, living and dead is close at hand."
