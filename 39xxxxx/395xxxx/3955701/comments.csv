BUT I didn't pay attention to the language; this is the SPANISH version, not French or English. Major bummer for me, but hopefully good for someone else."

Just shove these in the same folder as the video and play the video with VLC, and it works!

There is an original french audio version over at isohunt.  You've all been outdone by isohunt. :("
