,irreverence,2008-02-15T02:32Z,"Firstly: Are there subtitles?; Secondly is this version *as i saw the exact same torrent on btjunkie* tracked by Paramount? Check btj and the comments by several leechers who got warnings from their ISP's because of tracking; And lastly, are the subtitles embedded or do you need to open a separate file (which is where I understand the cookie from paramount is)?"
,lothainroxos,2008-03-01T04:48Z,"dude, your onto something, they ben after me a while, fucking media purists, op, disconectig."
,Starpass,2008-03-26T02:40Z,"AXXO is back. He's been back for awhile now.

Thanks for the upload axxo."
,franzrebs3,2008-05-03T11:36Z,"To all the dimwits, this isn't axxo's account, but of a different person who's doing us a favor by uploading axxo's torrents.

This is a great movie, with excellent quality."
,trubofan,2008-05-04T11:26Z,"Are there subtitles?
- Yes, there are, each time the person in the movie speaks different language than english (berber, japanese, spanish - actually there is not much English in that film) you can read that she is tellin in Enlish.
is this version *as i saw the exact same torrent on btjunkie* tracked by Paramount? 
-This film really sux ass, no matter it has 7.7 at IMDB, so it's not Paramount who can sue you, right the opposite you can sue them for 2.5 hours you wasted while watching  this piece of shit. Really. I deleted the movie right after I watched it, although I always try to seed as much as possible. 
are the subtitles embedded or do you need to open a separate file (which is where I understand the cookie from paramount is)?
The subtitles are not hard-coded, they are in the separate .srt file with the same name as the movie (so you don't hhave to care about it, your player will open them if it supports subs). And don't be so lame it's not a cookie from Paramount for sure, neither the file which can help Paramount to track you."
,cerrense,2008-05-19T06:22Z,"How do we add subtitles to an avi movie?

Please advise anyone...
Thank you!"
