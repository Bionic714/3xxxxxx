Here's a bunch of Disney kids cd's I made into one customized mp3 cd. I included the labels I made using Memorex Label Maker (so you must have that program to print the labels). I spent countless hours making this cd for my family for Christmas. It's a pretty good collection of the Disney cds that I grew up with. CDs included are:
1)Children's Favorite Songs Vol 1
2)Children's Favorite Songs Vol 2
3)Children's Favorite Songs Vol 3
4)Children's Favorite Songs Vol 4
5)Disney's Greatest Volume 1
6)Disney's Greatest Volume 2
7)Disney's Greatest Volume 3
8)Silly Songs
9)More Silly Songs
10) Pardners

Pardners is a long lost tape that I finally found the cd of and was hence able to rip it. Enjoy and seed please!
