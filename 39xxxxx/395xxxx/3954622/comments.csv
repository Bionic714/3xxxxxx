,xcoreychaoticx,2008-03-25T19:17Z,"you guys, if you have a verizon phone, all you have to do is get a usb cord for your phone.
camera cords work.

then, on your phone, go to sync music.
then drag and drop.
btw, without a memory card, itll only hold like 6 minutes of music.

happy downloading!!!"
