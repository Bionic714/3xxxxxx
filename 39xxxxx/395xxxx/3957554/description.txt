Just a quick pack of installers for software I reccomend all my friends and family to use, most alternatives to standard applications. 


List:

-Firefox (internet explorer alternative, and the only browser I use)

-Thunderbird (outlook express alternative. I prefer local software for my email, so ive got my isp, domain, and 
gmail email adresses all going into thunderbird)

-Foxit pdf reader ( Much smaller, faster, and less intrusive pdf viewer, alternative to adobe pdf reader, that wont nag you to update twice a month)

-Vlc player (media player, plays most formats, i use this in combination with klite codec pack to play just about any file you'll ever run into)

-K Lite Codec Pack (see above)

-Utorrent (if your into filesharing, get of limewire/kazaa/bearshare and learn how to use torrents. This in combination withor piratebay.org should get you all the downloads you'd want)

-Pidgin (Instant messenger client that allows you to talk on just about all of the different messenger accounts out there. Yahoo, aol, msn, google talk, and probably more that i dont use) 

-Imgburn (downloaded a dvd in iso format? or a game iso? got bin and cue files? imgburn will burn them to cd/dvd for you. lightweight free alternative to nero)

-MediaMonkey 3 beta (I've used winamp since napster came out WAY BACK when. Just within the past year, ive found mediamonkey, and its probably the best mp3 player/organizer ive ever used. Similar to itunes, can tag/rename your files, move them, get album art/covers, create playlists, burn audio cds. and synch up your mp3 player.)

-Launchy (hit alt enter and start typing what you want to find/run. So much quicker than clicking through your start menu.)

-Winrar (this Should let extract just about any file you download.)


Hope someone finds this useful, will upload on a few public trackers, as well, as a few forums.
