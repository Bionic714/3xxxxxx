,d4mon1,2008-01-01T14:42Z,this real or not? quality anyone?
,chico32,2008-01-05T14:01Z,"Quality is great!
Both video and sound is perfect, just like dvd.

But it seems like the different copies out here are the same. When the Universal intro/logo start, it suddenly jumps right to the movie and skips the usual text like Director, actors etc. 
But I guess thats where the movie actually starts?

Anyway, great upload and seeding right now."
