So, several months later, I've finally been able to track down every last mix that DJ Doboy has ever made up to this date.

As far as the official page goes, this is it, but rest assured, if there's anymore to be added, I'll be updating as needed.

I've mainly went to all of this effort because I'm sick and tired of having to track down all of these files, and the previous torrents were incomplete and/or dead.  

I understand it's a huge torrent, but seed this, and seed this for as long as possible.  

Also, due to the fact that the vast majority of the track listings and cue sheets found online for these mixes are completely and totally inaccurate, I will not be including them either.  Same with the cover art.

Stay tuned for more updates, as eventually I'll split this entire collection into their individual tracks.
