,siorai,2008-06-16T21:59Z,"Ack.  Okay, so I'm seeding again, but which were the mixes that were messed up? I'll do my best to replace them and place them in another torrent.

I thought I did quality control on every last track, but apperently I must have missed a few tracks.  Just tell me which ones they are, and within a week or so, I should be able to replace them in another torrent.  Just let me knowww! "

,siorai,2009-11-12T15:21Z,"Also. around april of 2009, there was a rumor of a new mix, Trancequility 39, which is on his website still, but it hasn't been updated since, if this ever gets released, or DJ Doboy comes out retirement, I'll probably post it up too.  But until that comes, this still remains the only complete discography of DJ Doboy"
