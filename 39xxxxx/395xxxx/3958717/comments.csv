,spiketank,2010-02-14T14:12Z,"There is no "".cue"" file to go with the "".bin"" file so this is useless unless you use something MagicISO and extract all the contents to a folder and intsall from there.
Or use MagicISO to convert to an "".iso"" file and mount to a virtual drive of your choice."
,Lokiloki1995,2010-03-18T22:51Z,"A lot of you people are asking for a code

,termite43,2010-09-26T17:32Z,"Can't mount a .bin file with Daemon?  Sure you can.  There's two ways 1 - go to default programs and associate .bin with Daemon.  2 - When you open Daemon to mount an image, select all files and there you go."
,killakella,2010-11-13T17:53Z,"guys this isnt rocket science
1. download the torrent
2. convert the bin file using magic iso
3. mount using daemon tools
4. (open the setup on the install disc if autoplay doesnt come up)
5. install (serial key in the comments)
6. enjoy"
,Drakolich,2011-01-17T21:02Z,"gawd...dont convert anything just chose ""Show All files"" where u choose the .iso and u will see the .bin ...so hard? it worked for me"
,Ooinn,2011-02-28T06:23Z,"Windows 7 (64bit) here and I encounter ""An error (1)..."" when trying to install; I converted the .bin to a .iso and mounted it with MagicISO; using the key Lok posted.

Haven't been able to find any info about this error.

Am I missing a step?

-FYI: Download is error free"
,Ooinn,2011-02-28T06:29Z,"Hmm, apparently converting it to .iso was the reason for the error.

So if anyone encounters an error during install; try using the .bin"
,_joker_,2011-07-25T09:25Z,You can play it but it is impossible to save the game and patch won't fix this.
