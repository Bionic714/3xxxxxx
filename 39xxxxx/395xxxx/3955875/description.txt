THE PRESIDENT'S ANALYST - 1967

  James Coburn stars as a hip New York psychiatrist recruited by his mentor to take on the President of the United States as his exclusive patient. After awhile he becomes paranoid and flips out when he starts imagining that all the worlds spy agencies are after him. They are! He's forced to go into hiding when spies from all sides want to know his secrets. The social and political satire never lets up, as the usually unflappable Coburn becomes completely neurotic. Godfrey Cambridge is hilarious as his cohort and former patient (his opening monologue about self-hatred is a classic), and so is Severn Darden, who plays a charming Russian agent. In the end, all three must do battle with the most hated agency in the world. A true original with the utmost retro appeal today.
