Sorry I don't have Call of the Wild. But let me check around and see if anybody I know has it. I don't put alot of hope in it, but it's worth a try. If you don't see it posted in a couple of weeks, I can't get it.

,erpobdella,2008-01-02T05:28Z,"Fantastic, thank you so much JayRay. I'm seeding this one big time. What a great way to start off 2008. I've been requesting this, as my old VHS version has been dust for many years now. I'm an older guy that has seen many movies, and I have to say, this is on my top 10 list for off-beat movies for sure.
A classic, smart, funny, tripped out, satire spy film of the hippie/cold war era. It's like 4 movies in one, hard to describe, a must see for all.
IMDB Rating: 7.1/10

So, JayRay, I notice you up some rare titles of great movies. Ever seen this one? It's another great, off-beat classic I'm looking for is:
Barfly (1987) USA (ENG)
With Mickey Rourke & Faye Dunaway
If you live long enough, everyone will meet a Barfly... Screenplay by Charles Bukowski and loosely based on his life. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bukowski
It's a sleeper in the torrent world, very few seem to know about it. There has been a Nordic hard-dubbed audio version going around, but no proper ENG audio version.

TagLine: Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead.
IMDB Rating: 6.9/10

Thanks again, JayRay, and if you can up Barfly, I know many will like that too."
,erpobdella,2008-01-02T20:01Z,"Me again, just to let you all know, this is the real deal as JayRay described, I'm seeding now......... And JayRay, no bother with Barfly, I found a proper version of it here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3539239/Barfly.custom.swe.TFMP"
,modul,2008-01-03T00:12Z,Is the sound out of sync for anyone else?
[T],JayRay,2008-01-03T01:37Z,"modul:

I just checked the video in my torrent, and the sound is ok. If yours isn't in sync, I don't know what  the problem might be. 

JayRay"
,erpobdella,2008-01-04T08:12Z,It's in sync for me too modul. I'm using VLC. You may try running avidemux - avidemux.org (it's 100% free).
