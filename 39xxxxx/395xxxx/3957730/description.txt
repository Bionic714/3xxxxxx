_____________________________________________________________Summary__

Within days of the massacre at the Munich Olympics, Israeli Prime
Minister Golda Meir secretly ordered the Mossad to hunt down and
assassinate all those who were responsible for the planning and
execution of the carnage. In the next seven years, more than 25
terrorists and terror masterminds were killed. This campaign,
conducted by a specially trained hit-team, has been the subject
of innumerable accounts by writers, journalists and filmmakers
and is the basis of Steven Spielberg's feature film Munich. Up
until now, no-one in the Mossad was permitted to speak in detail
about the extraordinary series of events. Zvi Zamir, then head of
the Mossad, goes on record, along with other former and active
Mossad agents to tell their side of the story. Renowned Israeli
journalists David Halevy and Ron Maiberg reveal the secret
operations of the Mossad hit squad and their missions to bring down
the terrorists in major European cities and throughout the world.
