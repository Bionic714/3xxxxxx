As found on Rhymesayers.com/Atmosphere:

as a way to thank all of our supporters, Ant and i have put together this party favor.

it's called "Strictly Leakage." thirteen songs to chase away the winter doldrums.
free and downloadable at either of these links: 
 

it's great for first dates, crappy houseparties, or to play in the backround while you google yourself again.

is downloadable a word? what's a doldrum?

nonetheless, thank you for the love, and please have a happy safe holiday.

oh yeah, i almost forgot, "sad clown bad winter 11" is available now, and a new album from atmosphere, "when life gives you lemons, you paint that shit gold" will be available on april 22, 2008.
