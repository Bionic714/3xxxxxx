thanks"
,shwnboy,2008-01-03T15:31Z,"  No these have the PS2 Emu patch on them.  Which was deemed acceptable.  There wont be any rips or splash bull crap in any of the releases.  If one is found tell the group at ps2project1@gmail.com or visit our website.  So we can nuke it

  As for the champions of norrath, of course we have it.  Can we dump it by itself?  Most likely not.  We have emassed all the letter C titles.

  There is one we are missing that we are having trouble finding it without buying.

SCUS-97479 - ATV Off-Road Fury 4 not the PROTOCOL but the start2DVD9 version"
