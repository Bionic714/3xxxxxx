,s.k0v4cs,2008-07-23T05:41Z,"I've added a new version of this, it's here:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4305984/The_Suite_Life_of_Zack_and_Cody_S3_1-19

It contains the same files for 1-16, plus ep. 17-18 (Foiled Again, Romancing the Phone) uploaded by ghalen177, plus ep. 19 (Benchwarmers).

If you download it to the same directory, the torrent client should recognize you already have files 1-16."
