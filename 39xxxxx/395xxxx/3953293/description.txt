How I got these is a long story.


Roy Drusky 24 Albums 1961 - 1978  @ 128 was put together from the following torrents.

Roy Drusky 14 Albums 1961 - 1969/Various Bit Rates (Vinyl)

Roy Drusky 10 Albums 1970 - 1978/Various Bit Rates (Vinyl)

They were converted from albums, by aussiecobra Of www.bitsarah.com and posted.

They were then changed (very slightly) an reloaded to piratebay.

They ran there course and was deleted. However the torrents was picked up by isohunt and that is where I got them.

so I reposted them and got them working again with help of Sunset B that reseeded it for me. We was Then able to repair Both sets of torrents.


I have Converted them to 128kb/s CBR mp3's

So now I am uploading them in One peace.  


Enjoy
