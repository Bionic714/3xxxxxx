This is an Attempt to Restart the Torrent. 

As I only have 63 percent of the torrent. 

I am makeing a request for the torrent to be reseeded. 

And they would like a link to the torrent.

It had disappeared so I am reuploading it.

I Guess No one reads the fine print,
as this torrent is at 21 peers now.

But thankfully Someone has 99.6% of it now.

Thanks

Thanks Bunches, Torrent Has Be Restored.

And at this time there is 10 seeds and 20 leechers.

Just for everyone to know, This must have NOT been the original torrent. 

As I found in the process of rebuilding this. 
another torrent, that the data fits into with the exception of 2 peices. 

When you Listen to these songs, they are messed up.

(1965) Greatest Hits\02 - Pick of the Week.mp3
3/4 of the way in.

(1969) My Grass Is Green\09 - Break My Mind
At the beginning.

So We have also restored this torrent up to 99.8%, Thanks Again.

If I or anyone else finds these songs, upload them as a patch to this torrent.

I shall listen to the songs you have mentioned, I have one original that has completed 100 % errorfree. And the same with the 10 album one. Are you working with any similar torrents?
