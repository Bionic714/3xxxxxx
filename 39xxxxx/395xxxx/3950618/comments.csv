Bless you for bringing back Momoi Haruko and Nakata Jouji."
,mystearica007,2008-03-09T23:57Z,"Uh... (I feel stupid for asking this, but) Do I just burn this on a dvd-r disk or something and play it that way on my PS2?"
,Ace__,2008-05-08T18:34Z,"Why have is all the files .rar files!?
And why havent u converted to iso?
"
,zebbox,2008-05-17T12:47Z,OMG this was so damn boring this version.
,ludomancer,2008-06-03T05:44Z,"I thought the majority of the voice acting in the original was pretty decent.  English voice acting has come a long, long ways from the 80's and 90's.  
Regardless, it's a fucking SIN when a publisher does not include both versions on the disc when it's localized, so THANK YOU for uploading this.  I will gladly play this game again and enjoy the native language greatly!"
,shinsen16,2008-09-21T13:38Z,I'd like to ask as well if we just burn this to a dvd and pop it on our ps2 to play it? (sorry if this is a stupid question)
,talz13,2008-10-19T17:11Z,"if your ps2 is soft/hard modded (mem card hack or mod chip), then you should be able to burn and play.  If you use mem card hack like fmcb you must patch the image first with memento patcher or esr patcher"
,Rorimori,2008-11-23T17:04Z,"SEED PLEASE!!! I am trying to download this, the game is awesome!!!"
,crazieman0925,2008-12-07T04:48Z,"Uhh... sry
how do i run this on pcsx2?
is that even possible?"
,leaflord,2009-04-20T20:38Z,"I have a mod-chipped PS2 PAL edition (I think region 3). Can it run this game, considering its region 1?"
,Spyke88,2009-06-10T17:27Z,"Domo Arigato Gozaimasu! (^_^)

Thanks a bunch for all these excellent ""undubbed"" games!
Japanese voice-actors are so superior to english!

I'm going to modchip my ps2 v7 PAL (better late than never) and as far as ive understood it, modchipped playstation2's play all PAL/NTSC-games, burned or imported."

,Miqunator,2010-01-03T06:10Z,"Thanks

Works just fine on a PAL 7000x PS2 /w Swapmagic
Burned to a DVD+R with DVD Decrypter (the PS2 doesn't like RWs)

Nice to be able to try this game in Europe with the original soundtrack, considering how natural it seems with JAP voices on ENG subtitles it makes you wonder why they don't include both in the original version "
,weicheng,2010-07-01T00:59Z,"thank you so much!~~ i always hated eng dubs and i always wanted to play this game but i didn't want to play the american one so this is really great, again, thanks alot! "
,dokuganryuu,2011-01-04T12:07Z,"thanks for the great torrent and...how i burn the game intothe disc,i have to join the parts?,mi download hasn't finished yet,so i don't know if that come in parts,any help will be apreciated^^"
,dokuganryuu,2011-01-04T12:13Z,"to join them,i have to grab all those files a put them into the disc?"
,algieba78,2011-01-31T22:13Z,"Runs fast and great in pcsx2, japanese voices are a treat even if you don't speak japanese (US version had NO VOICE AT ALL for the skits - awful), and the opening song is a blast with jap lyrics (the US version replaced the voice with a cheap synth guitar - awful x 10).
FMVs have no subs, but nothing of importance is said in them.

If you must understand FMV voices, you can download the normal US version and load saves just before the video, to listen the voices in english."
,dokuganryuu,2011-02-08T23:37Z,"do you take requests?,if do can you make a undub of Xenosaga 3??"
,dokuganryuu,2011-02-08T23:37Z,"Sorry i forgot to thank you for this awesome undub,thanks man"
,stogi1knobi,2011-03-12T19:29Z,I have the English version of this game and the Voice acting isnt as bad as you make it out to be. But i am curious to hear the Original version.
,AceValance,2011-04-25T15:58Z,"Is this NSTC OR PAL.
PLS SOMEONE COMMENT!"
,Wrathalos,2011-05-30T06:35Z,"Thanks for this torrent. I'll be seeding for all, and for those of you seeding. Thanks to you as well ^_^. I began downloading and in no time I was up over 650 kB/s :) keep it up. And thanks again for the torrent bro :D"
,jackiexii,2011-07-11T18:33Z,"Help please, I tried this on the pcsx2, it is working fine until it got stuck on the loading screen(w/ white dots at bottom right) after the sword training at beginning of game."
,stark17,2011-09-22T21:29Z,Same glitch as comment above. What could be causing this? It just hangs right after the sword training in the begging of the game
,stark17,2011-09-23T10:08Z,"Alright, I got to fix the freeze after the training scene in the beginning of the game. 

Dont use pscx2 load function to load before this scene. It is better to use the game's save and load state. Turn off all speed hacks and game fixes for now. And then playthrough up to after the training scene. IT SHOULD BE OK NOW. After that scene, you can use pscx2's save/load state. 

Hope you guys enjoy the game as much as i do. thanks for the torrent uploader!"
