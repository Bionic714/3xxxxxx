Not quite the "Holy Grail" of rare tracks but close.
Dennis Wilson was the first Beach Boys to release
a solo project in 1977. This is the working recordings
for the second. Two tracks were donated to the Beach Boys
L.A. lp. Carry Me Home was a left-over from the Holland
lp.
The audio quality is midrange to excellent.
From my research the only reason the Lp has not
been issued it that James Guercio owns the tapes
in lew of payment for the sessions.
