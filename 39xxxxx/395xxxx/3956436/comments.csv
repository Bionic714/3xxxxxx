[T],stupidul,2008-06-24T14:49Z,"About CDs 2 and 3 - I noticed (even with the original ones), that sometimes I get a ""Please run this program from CD"" message.
It just seems to pop that message up once in a while. Anyway, I recommend inserting the disk (or image) in a drive with one of the letters D,E,F. Any other driver letter will most likely get you the error message."
,Taikeri,2008-08-29T23:51Z,"Great, i was trying to find ""Learn korea"" in finnish, instead i found ""Learn finnish"" in english. Anybody know where i could find ""Learn korea"" collection? Or should i buy it from a book store?

Same in finnish (for all you learning finnish ;P):

Hienoa, yritin etsiä ""Opi koreaa"" suomeksi, sen sijaan löysin ""Opi suomea"" englanniksi. Tietääkö kukaan mistä löytäisin ""Opi koreaa"" kokoelman? Vai pitääkö ostaa kirjakaupasta?"
