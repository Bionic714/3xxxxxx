Learn to speak Finnish
======================
(from 102 other languages)

2nd edition (first one used a private tracker that went down)

CD1 - Beginner
CD2 - Beginner+ 1
CD3 - Beginner+ 2
CD4 - Intermediate

Edit: 
About CDs 2 and 3 - I noticed (even with the original ones), that sometimes I get a "Please run this program from CD" message.
It just seems to pop that message up once in a while. Anyway, I recommend inserting the disk (or image) in a drive with one of the letters D,E,F. Any other driver letter will most likely get you the error message.
