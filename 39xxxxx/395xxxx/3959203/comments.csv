,IOError,2008-01-04T14:32Z,"Yeah xtraa you are correct it is the last current version... And if you actually read the info I put in you can make it work on any revision of the Safari builds and even further at times... The changes are minor and may affect some people on leopard but most of my mates say this is working perfectly. And considering the number of times it has been leeched off me I can only assume that it is still working perfectly (well except for one moron who didn't know how to ""Show Package Contents"" *sighs* ) "
,cammac2000,2008-01-05T13:06Z,Unfortunatly it doesn't work on Leopard. So don't try. Thnaks anyway for sharing.
