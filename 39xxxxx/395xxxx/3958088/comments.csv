,torrentuser2008,2008-01-12T11:47Z,"Not a virus. Some people have moron sense, it seems
(yes, it's a weak joke :))
But it's only to retrieve keys already entered, not get a new key

Use a virtual pc to check software"

,ninjatakedown,2008-07-27T00:26Z,"yep all the cracks etc i have ever scanned have come up as trojans. but even if you have a trojan with negative effects, they are often a menial task to fix.

,ntoskrnl,2008-08-09T16:20Z,This is fucking not a keygen! It's just a tool to retrieve lost serials from ALREADY INSTALLED PROGRAMS!
,loiyer,2008-09-14T19:25Z,the problem with keygens comin up as trojans is that sometimes it is a trojan

[[[[[Stoopidity and Idiocy ALERT!]]]]]

These motherfuckers posting **VIRUS!!** **VIRUS!!** **THE SKY IS FALLING** **THE TERROSISTS ARE COMING***

are Republicans and possibly Dick Cheney's offspring.

IDIOTS: Any PATCH file or Keygen WILL show up as a virus... DICKHEADS.

Read what virus it IS before you do anything, most AV programs delete keygens, patches and such.

Use NOD32 and it will not give you as many FALSE positives.

If there really IS a virus in here, **I** will tell you"
,XweAponX,2009-02-06T20:22Z,"Ok here is what it says:

Scan performed at: 2/6/2009 11:16:23 AM
Scanning Log
NOD32 version 3828 (20090205) NT
Command line: C:\Download\FinisTorrents\Product.Key.Explorer.v1.9.6.Incl.Patch\Setup.exe
Operating memory - a variant of Win32/Adware.WhenU.SaveNow application

Date: 6.2.2009  Time: 11:16:27
Anti-Stealth technology is enabled.
Scanned disks, folders and files: C:\Download\FinisTorrents\Product.Key.Explorer.v1.9.6.Incl.Patch\Setup.exe
C:\Download\FinisTorrents\Product.Key.Explorer.v1.9.6.Incl.Patch\Setup.exe - Win32/TrojanDropper.Agent.NLK trojan - unable to clean - quarantined - renamed to C:\Download\FinisTorrents\Product.Key.Explorer.v1.9.6.Incl.Patch\Setup.V00exe
Number of scanned files: 1
Number of threats found: 1
Number of files cleaned: 1
Time of completion: 11:16:27 Total scanning time: 0 sec (00:00:00)


And I am questioning the result until I can find out exactly what ""Trojan Dropper Agent NLK Trojan"" is.

Most likely that is the code the program uses to look up and copy the Product Keys for various programs and as long as it does not connect to a remote computer, it is AOK.

Even if the program has a process that wants to connect to a remote host, all ya gotta do is run NETSTAT -ABN and it will tell ya what process is trying to communicate.

THEN you set up a firewall rule that prohibits that process from connecting to the remote.

So, it is easy to deal with, IF in fact this is malicious code, which I pretty much doubt."
