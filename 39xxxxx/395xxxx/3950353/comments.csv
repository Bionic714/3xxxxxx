Contains over 100 individual comic book issues ranging from January 1999?August 2006: 363?474, and annuals 1999?2001, including advertisements, exactly as originally issued by Marvel Comics."
,Deznaj,2007-12-28T09:26Z,"Yes it does. Too bad the official DVD-ROM is made up of crappy scanned pdf-files. Marvel dropped the ball yet again when it comes to e-comics.

Get the unofficial scans in cbr-format for quality!"
