Train To Pakistan is a movie based on the  historical novel by Khushwant Singh, published in 1956. It recounts the Partition of India in August 1947.

Instead of depicting the Partition in terms of only the political events surrounding it, Singh digs into a deep local focus, providing a human dimension which brings to the event a sense of reality, horror, and believability.
