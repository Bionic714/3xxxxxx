Hello World!


	For those that don't know if they should get America's Army or not. Let me list some of the reasons why:


		1.) It's Free
		2.) It's Ultra-Realistic
		3.) Well, it's very fun

	I've uncluded a few videos of a few training sessions. And a picture of the Badges you can earn while training.
	
	I've also included the torrent file (Courtesy of www.americasarmy.com) You can use the torrent file to easily download America's Army, the only downside is the file is around 2.8GB. So I suggest you clear some room on your hard drive, or if you have an external hard drive then put it on there (Suggestion)...
