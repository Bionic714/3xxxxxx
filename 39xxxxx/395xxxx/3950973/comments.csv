[T],passionettez,2008-01-04T08:20Z,Thanks so much.  I works perfect.  Didn't have any problems.  Good find!
[T],passionettez,2008-01-07T20:32Z,"well now the activate in 30 days is coming up.  I uninstalled and reinstalled using serial number the pasting the .exe file in the install directory.  I am assuming that is the file.  Is that correct?  When I did that I still got the activation in 30 day thing but it said 28 days..

any help would be much appreciated..
thanks in advance"
