18/8/2004 ??"
,tomh2o,2007-12-29T13:19Z,I can t say if this is the cracked version or not cause I did have wsftp installed on my pc before. I just installed it and it works fine. There isn t any crack to run in the torrent just the install exe
,webdesign,2007-12-29T13:29Z,"What about the date  18/8/2004 ??

,ezboard,2008-03-17T19:03Z,"shut the fuck up ok? this guy (or girl, whatever, I don't care) gave us a good torrent, and I personally thank you for this.
the date? who knows? who CARES?! not me! For all I know, the comp date could have been delibrately set wrong to bypass something, or their comp clock could be set wrong, it's NOT AN ISSUE."
,bl4d3x,2008-05-01T16:13Z,Isn't 2007 version...
,intoxic8ed,2008-05-16T15:12Z,Who cares if its not the 2007 version. Its a freaking FTP client...and a damn good one @ that.  I have been using F.O.S.I. releases for many years and have never had a problem.  Thanks for the upload RvA. =)

Don't even acknowledge the waterheads and they will crawl back in their holes.
