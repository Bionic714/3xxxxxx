The film opens with the autopsy of the deceased Jigsaw Killer, John Kramer, who was killed in the ending climax of Saw III. During the operation, a wax-coated audio cassette is found in Jigsaw's stomach. Detective Hoffman is called to the scene, where he plays the tape which states that, although Jigsaw is dead, "the games have just begun."
The scene changes to two men awakening in a mausoleum, finding themselves in one of Jigsaw's prearranged "games". One man has been rendered blind (his eyes sewn shut), while the other is mute (his lips sewn together). In a desperate attempt to escape, the mute man kills the panicking blind man, takes a key from the blind man's neck, and frees himself. He then begins screaming in terror which causes the stitches to tear free and blood pours from his mouth.
