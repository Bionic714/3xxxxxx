Here is the one of my two live dvds i have done a while ago. Some guy came up recently asking if i have any Gravity Kills videos and i promised i\'m gonna put these up somewhere. So go people get it and seed, seed, seed. Before the official DVD came out (i hope, they promised that while ago and maybe this year is the time). Gravity Kills was always good about people sharing their music and videos.
