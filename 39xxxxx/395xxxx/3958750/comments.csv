,nettebr,2008-01-21T15:32Z,Hi. I'm new at this and I can't make it work for more than 60 minutes either. How do I make the crack work? How do I use it properly? Please help. Thanks.

1) Right click and copy the crack file, you will paste this later.

2) Right click the game shortcut and go to properties, then click find target, this will take you to the game folder.

3) Now paste the crack into this folder. When asked to replace click 'yes'

4) Close all boxes down and run game"

And yes, there is a working crack and the file isn't corrupt. I didn't have any problems with it, even scanned it with an av program and it came out clean."
