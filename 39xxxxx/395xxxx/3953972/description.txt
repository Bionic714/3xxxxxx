Description:
Battle across the entire globe as you make your bid for world domination. Gameplay unfolds in a richly detailed Earth made up of 60 skirmish maps representing real locations on the globe or create a randomly generated globe to conquer.
Choose both the starting location and starting era.
Unique Civilizations ? Civilizations are divided into three factions Western, Middle-Eastern, and Eastern. Each faction has its own unique tech tree, units, structures, and game play style.
Customizable Ciilizations - Each Civilization's tech tree allows players to create completely custom civilizations of their own choosing.
Fully Persistent World ? Unlike any other RTS, players can keep their spoils of war. As your empire spreads cities and outposts will grow and improve. Units and structures evolve over time.
