This is the 07' firework display I put togeter for New Years.   it took 5 hours to wire all the fuses togather to make this happen with an electronic detonator.

we had some difficulty at fist but it was a grand slam for just some residential fire works.

this is as professional as you get for some NON commercial fireworks in a friends back yard.


you will love this my frinds..... Me and my friend work all day putting this display together. its so cool I think you will love it.....
