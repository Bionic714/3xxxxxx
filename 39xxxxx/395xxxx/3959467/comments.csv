,magicxx,2008-01-05T18:08Z,"There is no point in downloading this torrent. This AmigaOS4 Final is only for AmigaONE Sytems. This will not work on any other machine ie x86. If your expecting this to run, dual boot on a windows machine forget it. PPC ONLY AMIGAONE SYSTEM. 

If you want an amiga os to run on x86 download AROS it is free.

ANOTHER POINTLESS TORRENT."
,magicxx,2008-01-05T18:12Z,"Oh Ill add another thing to , if this AmigaOS4 Final is for classic amigas, then you still need a PPC card which are retailing at ÂŁ500 + on ebay Still worth downloading this torrent? Get AROS.

,rogue2008,2008-01-05T22:27Z,"Yes, its the AmigaOne Version but you can use this for the Moana Bootloader and run OS4 on a Mac Mini. Have fun!"
,arsipaani,2008-01-06T04:40Z,Where can i find moana bootloader and instructions how-to ?

Oh, really? AmigaOS not running on your standard x86 PC? Gee, that's a surprise... Also, just because it's a release not aimed for an x86 PC doesn't make it ""pointless"", you cabbage head genius."
,rowdy,2008-03-24T21:03Z,"Why the hell suggest AROS when it clearly says ""If you came here because you thought AROS was a finished, complete and fully usable operating system, you will most likely be disappointed."" on the download page.  Stupid.

Also, this version of AmigaOS4 + a patch can be installed on certain Mac Mini's.  Google it."
,tutting,2008-08-04T20:33Z,"Classic OS?
Try this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4328008/AmigaOS3.5.iso"
,skizzolfs,2009-01-01T19:20Z,"harg txs for share but i search the version clasic  for cyberstrom & blizard , i have a4000 ppc 604e & cybervision ppc ....
this version is only for hyperion amiga....

bye & txs"
,Raslatt,2009-02-28T21:42Z,"PLEASE UPLOAD AMIGAOS 4.1, so we can hack it to the MAC mini as well. 

The first who uploads it will get credits.."
,k9dog,2009-06-07T02:29Z,"Little disappointed about all the talk about running this on pc and mac. For those running on a PPC amiga you might be pleased to know that there is a version comming for classic Amigas with PPC. If some people manage to backwards engineer this code I wont be surprised if we start seeing some versions translated to emulate on linux-ppc, mac-ppc and ps3... To make full use of it, it would have to include compatible drivers etc. though."
