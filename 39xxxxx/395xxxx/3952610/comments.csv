[T],botpet,2007-12-31T16:39Z,"Sorry but nod32 is a bullshit...
I use kaspersky and I dont have too many problames with it...
In a half year I need to add new key ONCE...
No problame with kaspersky, this is the best Internet Security."

,Cerberus3x88,2008-02-20T17:07Z,"Can anyone tell me how to actually use the key onto the program?  Apparently, the file that has the keys can only be opened with some program called Registry Editor, and whenever I double click it, it wouldn't let me open the file.  Any ideas?  "
