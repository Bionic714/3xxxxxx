,monkiesatemybaby,2007-12-31T12:21Z,OOh my first downloader already...let me know if the patch works fine for you too.
,jlkendrew,2007-12-31T15:22Z,"im downloading it as we speak but i seem to be stuck on 96.6%, i will let you know if the program and patch work when its done"
,jlkendrew,2007-12-31T15:48Z,"ok then, ive finished downloading it and got the program installed but it wont let me apply the patch, i run the patch program and navigate to where replay converter is installed and when i click on the file where the patch is to be installed it comes up with an error message saying ""Error on writing file, please close the program or restart your system"" i have done that many times now and it does not make a difference at all, got any ideas, email me on jlkendrew@hotmail.com"
,monkiesatemybaby,2007-12-31T22:44Z,"When I patched it, it said ""success"" or some such and worked fine, removing the nag. I'm not sure what else to tell you, perhaps try gamecopyworld site and see if they have an exe for it, or perhaps serialcrackz site. If anybody else has any advice for them please post it."
,monkiesatemybaby,2007-12-31T22:45Z,"actually, upon reading the post again, are you trying to patch with the app open? replay converter must be closed/not running in order for the patch to work."
,monkiesatemybaby,2008-01-01T10:30Z,"Actually, all told, a definite mixed bag of a release by yours truly. I THOUGHT it converted a bunch of .m4b files into mp3s for me, but in fact it had created a bunch of little 320kb files of crap. So I truly hope the program helps you, but it sucks for me. Only way I found to fix the m4bs was to install fucking itunes and burn them to noteburner. pain in my ass. "
,Ender305,2008-01-09T23:55Z,"I downloaded the file and tried to unzip it in 7-zip but it said the file was invalid, am I doing something wrong"
,Kotone,2008-01-24T22:34Z,"This patch works just fine for me thanks, now i can finally convert those flv files without a watermark anywhere."
,BabeBrown,2008-03-01T21:29Z,"I hope it can convert some .flv files for me. 
Thank you for the share. :)"
,BabeBrown,2008-03-02T07:44Z,"This did exactly what I needed it to. Replay AV did not. 
I needed to capture .flv videos from About.com and convert them to .wmv. While the Replay AV couldn't help me, I was able to get the cached .flv files with FlashCapture and then convert them using Replay Converter. 
Thanks so very much! :)"
,monkiesatemybaby,2008-03-14T17:20Z,"
Awesome! Glad it helped! I'll keep that in mind if I ever need to do that complicated-souding thing you said...lol"
,yoncenator,2008-04-11T10:39Z,I don't see any patch.  All I see is a file I can't open and the replay program.  The 'instructions say I should see a patch.exe file... Where the hell is it???
,yoncenator,2008-04-13T22:30Z,"ok patch needs .rar ext but it still failed. At first it says 'crack worked!' then as soon as you try and run the program it says 'your license has expired'
Any other .flv converters out there that are simple??"
,zerukesu,2008-04-21T14:17Z,"I downloaded a video from youtube,but i didnt have to convert it ..i just used the VLC-player and that was no problem..
So if you have trouble with converting use VLC or Dziobas players..cheers"
,michael_isleman,2008-04-25T20:36Z,"This is NOT Replay Converter!!!
It is Replay Media Catcher. A very good program, But it can NOT convert files, as monkiesatemybaby says."
,monkiesatemybaby,2008-09-28T00:31Z,"I'm not even seeding this anymore, since as I mentioned it didn't even do what I intended it to do. I do, however, see that a few other peeps have had success with it. Only reason I'm posting is because michael_isleman called me a liar, which I'm not. It is absolutely what I said it was, not what that fucktard said. I very seldom have original content to post, but when I do, it's real, and I don't fuck people over. Anyone who says different is a goddam liar and I don't appreciate it, so fuck you very much mike, I hope you get penis cancer."
,siloin869,2008-11-20T03:31Z,ya. patch out of date. is there another crack out there?
,prowlerblaze,2009-03-26T02:27Z,"what the registration code, please reply back to me, my email is sonicfreakrdz@yahoo.com please tell me"
