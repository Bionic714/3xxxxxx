,finn57,2008-01-05T19:27Z,This is the Panzer IV medium tank...not the Panzer VI Tiger.
,slikboy,2008-01-08T19:47Z,"Hey Spoiler - GREAT UPLOADS

But this is not the Panzer VI, this movie is the Panzer IV.  I think you mis-labeled them.

Could you post the real Panzer VI movie????  The Tiger is one of my faves.

Thanks"

Second, I took the Panzer IV one and it's correct, so maybe you could upload this one again? It'd be greatly appreciated "
