Fans of Emilie Autumn's 2006 'Victoriandustrial' masterpiece,     
"Opheliac", have seen glimpses of her alternate reality world
she calls The Asylum (For Wayward Victorian Girls) through her    
theatrical live shows and eccentric interviews.
But now, for the very first time, you are invited to look
through the keyhole into The Asylum itself. Emilie Autumns's
Limited Mini-Album/EP "4 O'Clock," gives special access
launching you head first into the middle of Psych Ward No.1.
You'll hear the door slamming shut behind you, the buzz of
hospital lights flickering above your head, and you'll learn the  
first secret of the Asylum: one thing is for sure: whatever
you think it is, it's not what you think.

Featuring the haunting, "4 O'Clock," this new release also
contains an exclusive B-side, the  bittersweet and beautiful "My  
Fairweather Friend," four brand-new Remixes of songs from
"Opheliac", and, never one to keep things simple, Emilie Autumn   
also reads you stories from within the Asylum walls as well as
excerpts from her upcoming book, "The Asylum for Wayward Girls", that will leave fans shocked and readers
everywhere gasping for air.

This Limited Edition is packaged in the decadent style you've
come to expect from Emilie Autumn (and the Trisol label), this
gorgeous new Limited Edition 6-panel Digipak features exclusive
photos and drawings from within the Asylum...
