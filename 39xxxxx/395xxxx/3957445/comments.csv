A lot of the books are in plain text format, which I love.  The download is fast (look at all those seeders!) and there are terrific freeware programs available which make reading plain text documents    especially convenient and comfortable.  I'm using Bookreader, a Linux program that shapes the text in a familiar two column format, like pages in a book, and makes it easy to bookmark.

Thanks again!"
