,yasiths,2008-05-09T06:15Z,"Guys, this is a Black and White version... The original film is colored and it adds sense to the movie, but this B&W version sucks..."
,LuckyStrikeNor,2008-05-22T11:56Z,"IMDB say it's b&w... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056197/
""With a $10,000,000 budget, this was the most expensive black & white film ever made until Schindler's List (1993)."""
,TheMaJ,2008-05-31T10:52Z,"It certainly was B/W I've only ever seen the colorised version once in the early nineties, if anyone has a copy a torrent would be nice."
