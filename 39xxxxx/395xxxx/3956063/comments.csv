,zdubsey,2008-01-06T21:30Z,"Is this still being seeded?  I'm at about 48% but showing no seeds.

Is it being superseeded or is the seeder gone."

,dargonhuman,2010-09-01T07:57Z,"""Episodes sorted according to wikipedia episodes list (as it was until November 2008). As of December 2008, my MythBusters torrents and the Wikipedia episodes lists are no longer the same.""

That's why I used IMDB to rearrange the original torrent when I finished dl'ing it.  IMDB's lists don't change once the original air date is confirmed."
