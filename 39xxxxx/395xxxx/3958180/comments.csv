,yeti008,2008-01-05T13:44Z,"I do seed, but it's a very big file and there are many leechers at the moment. 
Once there are some copies up, it will become faster. 
I keep seeding. "
,domitan3,2008-01-10T10:04Z,"which burnprogr and kind of dvd do i have to use,
I tried without succes Nero & alcohol, on dvd - & + RW"
,misc_pirate,2008-01-13T22:11Z,"thanks for the DVD!

I did not manage to burn it receiving a message that there's not enough disp space on my TDK +R DVD with 4.7 GB. 
I think the DVD format was UDF.
(burn program: Sonic DigitalMedia LE v7).

Questions: must the DVD format be CDFS?
If so, how to arrange that the DVD gets this  format?

Name of DVD must be NAV_DB, correct?
I noticed many files referring to languages in folder \TPD\NCCBEUFNM_EU_20070801\ 
Do you guys think I just can delete folders of languages I do not need?
If not: there are many internet shortcut files in
\TPD\NCCBEUFNM_EU_20070801\\TABLES\0 folder.
Could I just delete those to save space?
Which burnprog / version do you recommend?

Sorry, many questions.
Thanks for assistance!"

,yeti008,2008-01-23T23:14Z,"Hi

@misc_pirate: I think it doesn't matter, but I use a DVD-R with Nero Burning Rom (7 and 8 works). 
I use the standard settings, but what's important, you have to burn it with the lowest speed available. Otherwise the DVD-Reader can't read it. (I even burned it on a DVD-RW and it worked)

@hrs_123: There are 2 different DVDs available. This is the ""High"" and not the ""Professional""; but this is missleading with the BMW-Wording for the Navigation-Model itself. 
As I wrote in the description it should work with the following BMW-Models: 
E46, E39, E52, E53, E65, E66, E83 und E85, or  ask your dealer, which DVD you have to buy. (If you have the original DVD it is writen on the DVD)
Regards Yeti008"

philips dvd
any ideas?"
,E5M1R,2008-05-18T00:24Z,"Sulejman, You shure that you have DVD
BMW originaly put this units from 03, you should not eaven have 16:9 screen in your car from factory. Your factory settup should be 4:3 screen with MK II CD Unit
Anyways, for you having problems, burn the file with imgburn or alcohol it will work, do not use cheap ass media, buy some quality, you are saving a lot by not buying the original."

do you guys have some update for the 16:9 system? not the navigation but the radio?
I know that by mercedes when you will update it then it will play mp3. Before the update it ignore the mp3 cd.
