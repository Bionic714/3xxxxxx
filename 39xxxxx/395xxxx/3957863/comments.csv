,masterstickman,2008-01-02T17:56Z,how are we supposed to dwld if noone is seeding?!?
[T],crazytoyboy,2008-01-03T13:54Z,"ciao DonQuiggifur mi aggiungo alle persone che aspettano, facci un regalo seed ;-)"
,Lappen59,2008-01-03T14:06Z,Why upload when you dont seed??????????
,masterstickman,2008-01-03T22:41Z,are you ever going seed? 
,joel8520,2008-01-03T23:06Z,plz seed
,DonQuiggifur,2008-01-05T23:46Z,"I'm a commercial driver; I can't be online while I'm driving, but I'm on (and seeding) whenever I stop driving.  Don't like it, don't download from me.  By the way, if I'm the only one with the torrent, the only one seeding it, it's going to be fucking slow no matter how long I'm on. "
,FearNLoathing,2008-01-09T00:54Z,"No worries, I have the patience of God and will be more than happy to seed once I finally get it downloaded. Every little bit helps, right? "
,kinamand,2008-01-10T08:56Z,"Well, thank you for upload :) 
Wiss for better speed :D :D "
,Cool Hand,2008-01-12T15:45Z,Somebody needs to seed!!!
,Khala,2008-01-15T07:35Z,"Did you even hear what he said?
We all are lucky for him to even take his time to upload this torrent..."
,Khala,2008-01-15T07:42Z,"1 Seed?
Yet my computer says there are more than 10, I must be getting connection from other sites..."
,Rhettius,2008-01-16T14:55Z,Everyone's at 0.7% - I hope you have 100Mb connection or something or else it will be hard to seed 6.8 GB.
,tasty_cake,2008-01-18T11:37Z,"Cheers for this mate, its much needed!
Can you maybe give us an idea of when you'll be on? Then we can get this moving......."
,FearNLoathing,2008-01-24T13:47Z,"I think now that the problem isn't just that DonQuiggifu isn't online often to seed. I've been able to get a seed several times, though not often. The problem is more of that he's got like, what? 300 people trying to download a 6.5 gig file and he's the only one seeding. We can't get more seeds until someone else can get a full download completed, and we can't get a full download without better seeding... it's very much a catch 22. I hate to say this, but maybe DonQuiggifur should limit the number of people who can download from him, so that maybe a few may be able to get a full torrent. Hopefully that would lead to more people able to seed. "
,stchadwick,2008-02-11T10:51Z,Will this play on 2.0.8.1A or does it have to have 2.0.8.7 to work?
,TehZorroness,2008-03-06T05:30Z,"Superseed.  This lets only one peer download the torrent untill it is complete.  After that point, there will be two full seeders.  It's a usefull tool for this sort of situation."
,Dirty_Pretty_Thing,2008-05-26T22:00Z,"why dont we all say what we're thinking?

this guy is a dumbass."
,xyser,2008-09-15T04:46Z,"WoW, reallly?

,toosoon,2009-05-20T02:43Z,"Thank you very much for the upload! im checking to see if it works, ill post."
