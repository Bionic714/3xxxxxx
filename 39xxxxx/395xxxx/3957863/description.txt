The Rosetta Stone 2.0.8.7 installer, with 27 language ISOs and the picture file disc (PC).  I just realized that they're all in .daa format, an image compression format.  Just download PowerISO (www.poweriso.com) and mount them to virtual drives therewith.  Just be sure to mount both the language files you would like to use, and PC.daa (the master picture file disc).  Any questions, feel free to ask.
