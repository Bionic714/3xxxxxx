,biglittlefish,2008-01-10T06:10Z,"Great! I just brought an intel and thought I wouldnt be able to use Trilogy.

Except running it through logic pro 8, on a macbook pro 2.2ghz and I get clicks all the time! Its too much for my new mac! Anyone know how to fix this, or is it just pretty much useless?"

Thanks for the up - really great!!"
