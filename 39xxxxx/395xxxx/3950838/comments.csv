,scenerator,2008-02-02T03:16Z,"It's NOT so clever that they stripped all the subtitles except english. The data size for subtitles are almost always so infinitecimal small that removing it doesn't improve any picture quality what so ever.

Removing some audio streams might improve video quality when you shrink a DVD9 release. Doing that with subtitles does NOT make any sense at all.

Thank you very much for sharing this release anyway!"

It forces people to learn English (NormalSpeak) instead of having to rely on subtitles in weird languages (GaySpeak or BabyTalk)."

HowÂ´s about if yourself went deaf.
Taste that for measure.
Let your brain think before you comment."
