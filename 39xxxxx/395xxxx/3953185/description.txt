Konzeptionelle Einf??hrung in Erlang

A jump-start into the world of concurrent programming

Originally developed by Ericson, Erlang was eventually released as open source in 1998. Although Erlang has been around for almost ten years now, it became a rather popular programming environment for communication platforms only recently.

The talk will equip the open-minded programmer with concepts of concurrent programming in a functional programming environment supported by real-world examples.

Despite the fact that actual code fragments will be in display, there is no need for novices and non-programmers to be scared away.
