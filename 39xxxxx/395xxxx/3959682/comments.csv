,UnderVerse,2008-01-18T17:56Z,What programs do i need to burn the game on to a CD/DVD ? Please answer :O

,MrPink66,2008-03-06T15:41Z,"Sry for being stupid but how do I install this game?

I haveunpacked the files and when I try to setup the install it says the game is running and I have to exit the game first. The game isn't fucking running thats the god damn problem so it's a bit frustrating.

Second off is the license agreement. I can't press the accept button. Maybe that's part of the problem.

All help is greatly appriciated."
