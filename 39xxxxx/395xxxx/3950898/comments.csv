,deezulboy,2007-12-28T18:04Z,That was my first choice but i tried like 5 different programs and none of them copied the dvd successfully. If you've got any suggestions let me know and i'll do it..but this version is pretty much dvd quality anyways...just in XviD.
,thelarran,2007-12-29T14:19Z,If you haven't already tried it you should try DVD Decrypter. That always works for me. It's free you can download it at www.dvddecrypter.org.uk
,sebadigri,2007-12-30T20:10Z,"Thx very much! One question, Can you find upload the subtitles ?? I want to make a fast DVD labpro quickly and if i get also the sub's for this divx it will look more sexy to play in the home theater! haha"
,mediumrock,2007-12-31T01:19Z,"Thanks for the torrent, but itÂ´s me or the audio and the image is out of sync??????"
,deezulboy,2008-01-03T01:00Z,"-- I dont beleive there are any subtitles on the dvd.

-- As far as it being out of synch i didnt notice that.  I skipped to different portions of the video and it seemed right.  Anyone else having problems?"
,alexbesht,2008-01-08T14:59Z,"Yeah im having the same sync audio problem, it is quite noticeable unfortunately... any suggestions?"
,daebat,2008-01-10T23:03Z,Ok i downloaded this and the audio isn't sync'd with the video.... does anybody have a fix or is this video useless? 
,C4103,2008-01-30T22:29Z,"I haven't finished downloading this yet, but you can use VLC to correct sync problems if you're having them.  It's under the Preferences menu...you click audio and then choose a value for ""Audio desynchronization compensation.""  The value is in milliseconds."
,C4103,2008-02-01T04:07Z,The value is 500ms.  Just put 500 in the option field and you should be set.
,C4103,2008-02-01T04:19Z,"It's actually kind of hard to sync it up because you have to skip to a part where you can see the drummer.  It still seems slightly off at 500, 515 looks a little better.  The best advice is to play with a value around there that suits your tastes."
,C4103,2008-02-01T04:42Z,"I think I got it this time, try 440ms."
,valenciacdef,2008-02-04T11:45Z,Does anyone has a interlaced thing problem?
,valenciacdef,2008-02-04T14:31Z,Does anyone have a problem with deinterlacing the videostream?
,acidfrehley,2008-02-28T05:04Z,"Is there a way to correct the synch and burn it to a dvd-r?
I wanna watch it on my xvid dvd, and not on vlc."
,incbsinfrn,2010-03-09T01:54Z,HandBrake works great when ripping DVDs
,energyman,2011-12-17T23:15Z,this particular torrent is reason why i've registered here....just to say this: thank you bro :D
