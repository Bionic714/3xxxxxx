I Know Who Killed Me in .mpg format. You can download this movie and watch it on windows media player or burn to a disc. This is totally bootleg so the quality is not perfect and there are not any dvd special features etc. which is why the file is so small.
All you can do is watch the movie, which sucks anyway. Enjoy.
