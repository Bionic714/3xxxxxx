,lasker76,2008-01-03T07:06Z,"I am using an intel based mac and when I try to play DOOM or DOOM 2 the game crash. The engine is universal binary but each of these games are PowerPC only, this is maybe why it crash in my system all the time."
,Syntheslizer,2008-01-03T07:15Z,Using Intel-based iMac running Leopard and both games work 100%.
,lasker76,2008-01-03T07:24Z,I am using Tiger 10.4.11 intel and the game still crashing
,the1silverwolf,2008-01-03T10:22Z,"I've run this same version on both my G4 PPC Mac Mini 1.42 GHZ and my new C2D iMac 24 and have had no problems with crashing.

You might try the forums at the following link for help.

While I did include copies of ""DoomLegacy"" for people with older computers that file isn't used if you are running the DoomsDay Engine.

it is a completely separate engine with no 3d support I only included it incase someone needed it for a slower macintosh."
,Benthol,2008-01-03T20:29Z,Running it on an intel iMac with 10.4.11 and all works fine. Thanks!
,ballju,2008-01-04T04:45Z,"""Running it on an intel iMac with 10.4.11 and all works fine.""
same specs as Benthol and it also works fine and I also want to say thanks!"
,herrnachbar,2008-01-05T07:43Z,Works great on MBP OSX Leopard. Thanks a lot! 
,the1silverwolf,2008-01-05T08:31Z,"I'm glad everyone likes the game, it's one of my all time favorites.  I think that the new engine with the new 3d textures maintains as much of the 'feel' of the original games as possible while still adding modern capabilities and graphic effects.

The Doomsday developers really did a fantastic job.  Not to mention ID software for creating games people still want to mod and play well over a decade later."

,Slowstarter,2008-01-28T21:01Z,"This was great! Now, where can I find Heretic and Hexen?"
,mara9ato,2008-02-07T03:02Z,Is there any way to play this on a Windows (or Linux) PC? Or maybe just the IWADs?
,Pieceofshitcrap,2008-02-10T15:23Z,I think it just runs on iMac not Macbooks...
,Slowstarter,2008-02-13T21:47Z,"It runs fine on my PowerBook G4 (1,5 GHz)!"
,the1silverwolf,2008-02-17T08:24Z,"-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

it runs fine on my First-gen Macbook (Black)
The system requirements are not that steep, pretty much any 3d grafix card will do, including the Intel GMA Integrated Grafix found in the Macbooks."

-----------------------------------------

Sure, the doomsday engine is available for multiple platforms.  You still need to download this torrent in order to get the high-rez add-ons and the wad files.

Then go to http://www.doomsdayhq.com/ to download the Window or Linux versions of the engine."
,the1silverwolf,2008-02-17T08:30Z,"-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------

Well, it took a fair amount of googling to find everything necessary for this package for Doom but I'm sure it's possible.

You'll need to find:

1. The .WAD Files for Heretic and Hexen (The Original Game Files)
2. The High-Rez updates

And, then you'll have to play around with the different High-Rez textures until you find a combination that works well and is to your liking.

I will put together a torrent for them when I get a  chance."
,mad434,2008-03-25T22:32Z,"i'm having some trouble with my saves, they keep corrupting and causing the game to crash while loading. any suggestions? (i'm not using the doomsday engine, just playing the games directly from the files...)

thanks!"
,mad434,2008-03-26T07:05Z,"ahhh, i figured it out. apparently the saves from i and ii go to the same slots....anyway, im also having trouble getting started with the Doomsday engine. anybody know a good beginners manual online?"
,the2silverwolf,2008-04-16T09:18Z,"You might find the information you are looking for at the homepage of the engine.
