,analjuggern4ut,2008-01-29T17:12Z,"@ MilosJovanovic:

Thank you for the wonderful Lufthansa DC-10 DVD you uploaded. It was really worth waiting.

It seems that there are currently 58 leechers in the queue for this torrent, most of them with the same %. You should limit the number of upload slots (options - preferences - bittorrent --> number of upload slots per torrent) so that instead of sending the same pieces to every peer at very slow rate, you would upload more (different) pieces to fewer peers at higher rate and they could in turn help to distribute it further."
,MilosJovanovic,2008-01-30T00:39Z,"My pleasure!

Thank You for your help about torrent client settings,analjuggern4ut . This has been my very first upload and I didn't know that. Just did the settings."
[V],Kuthumi,2008-02-01T18:20Z,"Thank you very much. I had some problems reducing and burning this image, mounted it with Daemon Tools, 1Click Dvd copy Pro ruined a disc, Nero Recode refused to handle it, had to open the mounted image and copy the Video folder over on the hard drive, then reducing the files with Nero Recode. Just mention it if someone else needs a solution."
,MilosJovanovic,2008-02-03T03:53Z,"@ Kuthumi 
Sorry You had problems with my torrent. Image was created with Cheetah DVD Burner 2.20 which I had at the time. I've tested the image with Daemon tools 4.08 and The KM player. The freeware KM player can open ISO files, no need  to have a virtual drive. Unless, of course, you want to reduce file size. 

My wish was to share a full DVD of this nice World Air Routes cockpit video so I decided to create an image of it.

Hope these infos are helpful."
