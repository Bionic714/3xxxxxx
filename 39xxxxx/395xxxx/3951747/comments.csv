,freitax,2007-12-29T05:53Z,"did you rip it out of a dvdr screener?or is it a re encode of the GRIM or Kingdom or TDE releases? Thanks

""I think it's time all nonsense about the releases for this movie is over.""
I'll second that! I think it's pretty lame they call themselves a scene, it was a fucking lame release by Done, there is a much better dvd screener and they went and use a terrible print with watermakrs all over the godam movie!"
,Nolgthorn,2007-12-29T10:11Z,"This is a new release ripped from a DVD Screener, without any watermarks and in high quality.  I will be jumping off soon after there are a couple of seeds, so stay on if you want to ensure anyone else will get a copy."
,sweef,2007-12-29T13:55Z,"nice one!!

,freitax,2007-12-29T17:34Z,I've preview the release and the video quality is a perfect 10!but I think it's out of sync isn't it?
,freitax,2007-12-29T19:02Z,Nolgthorn isn't this out of sync?if so what is the offset?
,Justine15,2007-12-29T19:06Z,What´s the point? Don´t post anything if you aren´t able to seed...
,freitax,2007-12-29T19:12Z,what are you talking about?
,david smith,2007-12-29T19:16Z,Thanks for the upload but why is there only one seed? This torrent is coming down so slowly.
,freitax,2007-12-29T19:38Z,it has to start sometime don't you think?I'm at 87% so in sometime I'll be a seed
,freitax,2007-12-29T20:06Z,"it's no fake I've previewed the entire movie using a rebuilder and it's the real deal, awesome video quality, but I'm not sure if the audio it's in sync."
,Justine15,2007-12-29T21:27Z,"Well, I got a bit irritated because it took over 8 hours to download. But it´s great quality, and not out of sync. There is no soundtrack because the brothers didn´t want any. Great movie, scaruy as hell..."
,captainjeff,2007-12-29T21:42Z,"Just finished downloading finally. Quality is great, and the audio is in sync. Thanks Nolgthorn."
,freitax,2007-12-29T21:49Z,"IT's FINISHED!!YES! I'm a seed :D I'll share till I have a 20ratio, NOLGTHORN YOU ARE GOD! Like I said before the quality is AMAZING!10! And the sound is perfect and completely in sync, no doubt!

Have no fear, this is the release to get, it's almost a dvdrip, the only problem it's the fact that it doesn't have the theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1, it's more close to 1.81, this is happens frequently in dvdscreeners, take a look at Control from HLS for example.

VIDEO : perfect 10(dvd resolution and almost no artifacts)- NO FREAKING BLURS AND PERFECT PICTURE
AUDIO : for a 2.0 acr3 is a 10!
MOVIE: 10"
,notbysight,2007-12-29T22:57Z,it is real
,verotik,2007-12-30T00:33Z,"Great quality, but WMP wants to play it upside down.  WTH?  Nero Showtime plays it right.  I dunno.  Thanks!"
,NeedMachine,2007-12-30T01:21Z,"Thanks, good quality!"
,dogman1962,2007-12-30T02:03Z,Top quality - thank you very much!
,freitax,2007-12-30T05:00Z,"I need to say this again, I've seen it all the way thru and it's perfect, both the movie and the release, big props to Nolgthorn and the coen brothers.
This version is absolutely brilliant, it's dvdr quality, not like all the other lame scene dvdscreeners, this one actually has dvd quality. About the aspect ratio it's slightly cropped on both sides compared to Done version but it also shows a lot more on both the top and bottom, so I guess this is how the coen brothers wanted their movie in video.

here are some screens so you can decide for yourself:
http://www.imagefap.com/gallery.php?gid=948437  (the done has some nasty blurs and washed out colors and bad compressing, horrible detail, all in all Nolgthorn release kicks ass, it's dvdrip with no loss, actually better than most ""scene"" dvdrip, come to think of it, it actually makes the scene look pretty pathetic)


Don't be a fool get this release"
,Nolgthorn,2007-12-30T09:35Z,Hey ferritax misspelled my name.
,stateofdreaming,2007-12-30T09:52Z,"The audio is decent and the video is excellent for the size of this rip.

The movie is awesome. A gem amoungst all the turds I've downloaded this month.

Thank you!"

beautiful.. now anyone now a good way to put the avi on dvd for a dvd player.. currently struggling with this.  thanks in advance."
,Devils_Reject,2007-12-31T20:32Z,convertxtodvd set in low priority to ensure the audio stays in sync with the video will convert avi to dvd just use imgBurn in build mode to burn. I prefer it over the built in burner in convertex.

,secondeye,2008-01-01T19:12Z,This isn't one of those obnoxious new kinds of torrents that require you download their diseased player is it?
,freitax,2008-01-01T22:02Z,"aren't you aware of the AVC codec(blu ray hd dvd, no?)? that's what you need to see this movie, if you don't want to look out for a AVC decoder the best thing to do is to download vcl player which is a completely adware free player that has most of the decoders built in."
