The first 5 tracks appear to be from the Amorica World
Premiere radio broadcast from 10/25/94. This was recorded
on the Blessed Chloroform small gig tour; the Professor
Stoned commentary on the CD is amusing. This is an
incomplete show. 

art work included

this is well worth having just nonfiction and long time gone...CLASSICS!

enjoy! :)
