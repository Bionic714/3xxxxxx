HERE IT IS! The fanedit sequel to the controversial "FRIDAY THE 13th IX: THE FINAL FRIDAY" edit!


This is essentially an edit of "Freddy Vs. Jason" without any other characters. Jason just fights Freddy. This one picks up where my last edit ended. I padded the edit out a bit using the ending of the last edit, a scene from "JASON X" and a deleted scene from "FvJ" that sets up a new beginning for Jason. The edit runs only 20 minutes, and the DVD contains a trailer. Artwork is supplied in the download.
