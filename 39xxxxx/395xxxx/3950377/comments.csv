,salonemusic,2009-08-08T04:36Z,"FYI: Subtitles only appear when characters are NOT speaking English. So if you are deaf or don't hear American English too well, you might prefer the original DoNE release with a complete English .srt file. But for most of us, this is a perfect version! Thanks, crazyea. Subtitles are white, with a black drop shadow. Easy to read. Video quality is quite good, doesn't seem to have suffered from the re-encoding."

,RexRexroth,2012-06-09T10:38Z,"Yes!  This is by far the best upload of the film for English-speakers on TPB.  The other uploads all come with subs in other languages, or direct you to a site where you can download English subs (or in many other languages).  The problem is the frame rate of the film must match the frame rate of the subtitle file, and all the downloads I've tried so far don't!  So if you've forgotten all of your high school French, this is the torrent for you.

MercĂ­ to crazyea!"
