,adhdyoshi,2007-12-29T02:20Z,"Thanks so much! I was looking for this forever, and couldn't find an invite from Myspleen anywhere... anyway I will be seeding for quite a long time!

Again, thanks so much for uploading this!"
,BloodLogic,2007-12-29T23:40Z,"If you enjoyed this, please check out my other shows. I upload plenty of cartoons (many of them are adult-themed, like the Adultswim shows). Only complete seasons and collections, too! Check it out:

Thanks, and enjoy the show!

[At the moment, this show has 38 peers and there's 28% availability, after I've shared it with a 0.635 ratio.  So, hang on.  I always upload my torrents until they're easily available with a big group of seeders.]"
,sirkolls,2008-02-04T08:06Z,"Is this all DVD quality?  Another torrent I downloaded both seasons of Get A Life from another site was half recorded off the TV and half from DVD.  I'd like to get the full season from the DVD if possible. Please let me know so I don't download the same thing again. And yes, either way....this is awesome that this is available like this!!! Get a Life RULES!!! Thanks for sharing this with everyone!!!"

,mountainvinyl,2008-05-30T06:34Z,"Until the legal morons sort out the rights to release these seasons on DVD, these copies and the rare out of print few episodes on DVD will do the trick. Thanks BloodLogic. Your a genius."

,jack_slacker,2009-08-21T03:19Z,"Thanks for this.  Would buy the complete series in a heartbeat but supposedly there are legal issues that are slowing things down.  Maybe one day.  I had lost my VHS tapes of these, so this torrent quite welcome. Thanks again!"
