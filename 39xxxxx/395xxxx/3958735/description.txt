All of the Modest Mouse albums and songs, Including:

Building Nothing Out of Something
Everywhere and his Nasty Parlor Tricks
Good News for People Who Love Bad News
Sad Happy Sucker
Interstate 8
The Lonesome Crowded West

Granted, there is no Baron von Bullshit, but that is a collection, not an original album.

Enjoy, and remember to seed!
