               Album Info..:                                                                   
                                                                                               
          After the frequently dark themes of his Warner Bros. years, James Taylor lightened   
          his approach in the '80s and '90s with gentle affirmations such as "That's Why I'm   
          Here" and "Shed a Little Light." Greatest Hits Volume 2, a sequel to the 1976 disc   
          that has sold 11 million copies, covers this material with a generous 16 cuts.       
          Unfortunately, thanks to the often too-polite production and a couple too many oldies
          covers ("Handy Man" is exquisite, "Up on the Roof" and "Everyday" somnolent), the    
          work here is uneven and blurred together. A handful of gems do prevail, though;      
          especially notable are "Secret o' Life"--perhaps Taylor's truly wisest song ever--and
          "(I've Got to) Stop Thinkin' 'Bout That."
