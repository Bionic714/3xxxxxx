,msh123,2008-01-01T23:42Z,HI _ How to make a DVD of this  . MKV??
,fiscalo,2008-04-24T00:42Z,"This torrent sucks. Cannot even make a decode! System hangs every time!
Next time try a normal format."
,odoinn,2008-11-09T16:46Z,"Waste of a download, sadly: it just doesn't work."
,OrpheusDude,2010-12-20T20:03Z,"MKV is the stupidest, most irritating, and utterly worthless format ever conceived.  It's virtually impossible to convert it to a format which can be burned on to a normal DVD.  A huge waste of time, especially as this is a really good film with a superb cast.  "
,digimagix,2011-12-11T01:50Z,OrpheusDude you are an idiot!
