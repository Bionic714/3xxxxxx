,wheelchairperth,2008-01-03T15:18Z,"My apologies about the slow speed everyone. I have a slow connection and am trying to seed quite a few things at once. Every now and then my family kick my torrent software off to work, but it will come back.
Thanks for your patience."
,k.m.f,2008-03-10T02:00Z,"I downloaded from this torrent instead of the original, because these files are compressed individually instead of altogether. This allows one to select only the files they want instead of the whole 9 yards. For instance, I was after all the Yaesu material, and thats all I have to download from this torrent.
Excellent upload wheelchairperth !"

You wouldn't believe how hard some of the older DOS RSS has been to find lately. "
