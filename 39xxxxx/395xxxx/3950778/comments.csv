And not a dvdrip, I'm looking for a retail DVD image like this one.
Thanks!"
,Papegoja99,2007-12-28T12:25Z,"By the way Kaspar, how many disks total will it be?"
,Kaspar4283,2007-12-28T12:39Z,"5 or 6. I think the 6th is some kind of bonus stuff. I will check out if it is worth the bandwidth, before I up it.

A quick googling turned out this, which should guide you to the rest of the S2 discs:
