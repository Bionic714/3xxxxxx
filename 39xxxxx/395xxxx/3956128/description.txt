KLAFELIN. This is special drug which make people to sleep. In Russia klafelin widely used by prostitutes to put clients to sleep and to rub them after . In this movie we show one real case which happen in Moscow with two prostitutes which were caught red-handed by client in attempt to put klafelin in his drink. Cruel corporal punishment by client of these unfortunate young girls followed after girls forced to strip: Two victims one by one fastened face down on the wood bench and unspeakably painful & degrading whipping by rubber whip and cane by sadistic client left their naked posteriors bloody red and girls yelled at the top of their voices. 


Comment:
This is hilarious, from the translated subs ("Expose your genitals. I have check for no bugs in your pussy") over the faked tongue kissing and 69-ing to the completely random quasi-psychedelic cuts.

Also, big props to the orchestral soundtrack, complete with that staple of Russian BDSM flicks, the religious choir singing (those wacky orthodox christians).

And the actual CP is very good too with some authentic crying.
