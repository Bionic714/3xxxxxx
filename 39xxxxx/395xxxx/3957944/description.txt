Mix by Luke Slater. 320 kbps. That's how he describes this CD:

â??This mix is a true representation of what I play there [at Fabric]. I wanted to do the main part down at the club to get that vibe right from the club. It's kind of a funky punk disco electronic mix and specifically related to Fabric. I'm excited. Fabric really is quite special, they put in a lot of effort and I have many, many emotions attached to Room 2. Before Fabric, I don't think there was really a big club in London that had done it right. The sound's so good in there. It's a really good place to be and it's really popular with the right crowd. You put all those together and you can't really beat it. â?? - Luke Slater
