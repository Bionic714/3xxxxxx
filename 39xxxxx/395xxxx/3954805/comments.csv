[T],stevekasian,2007-12-31T22:51Z,"New Folder RULES!!!

I was having trouble entertaining myself here at home - my computer was totally boring and I was on the verge of a boredom meltdown.

But then, I downloaded New Folder and everything changed - over night!! My computer is now the coolest, most exciting machine on the block, and I have been completely occupied 24/7... thanks to New Folder!

yaaaaaaaarr: I can never thank you enough for bringing New Folder into my life! You have shown me how to LIVE again! THANK YOU!!!

And thanks, New Folder!!"
,swamp33,2008-01-01T02:41Z,"Perhaps I was wrong in my first assessment of New Folder.  

I didn't quite grasp the entire value of entertainment contained within New Folder until I started creating my own versions of this game.

I don't claim to be a code genius or really have any code writing skills at all but once I started using New Folder it was like I had been empowered by some creative force.

Within hours of working with New Folder I have created what appears to be the sequel or possibly the first major expansion to this great program, New Folder (2)!!

I'm so proud of my accomplishments working with this entertaining software you can be too, give New Folder a chance.  

I apologize to the original authors of New Folder for my uneducated first impressions, New Folder is as powerful and entertaining as YOU make it."
,Jecille1,2008-01-01T03:45Z,From the makers of the best selling game New Folder and New Folder 2. Comes this years blockbuster movie. New Folder: Armageddon.
,AeronPrometheus,2008-01-03T01:01Z,"There's a Mac version of this game, it's called ""untitled folder"", but not as many people play it."
,lovetoseed,2008-01-03T13:33Z,"Yo dude, i saw this ages ago, it's no longer new, should be called ""Old Folder"", sheesh.
