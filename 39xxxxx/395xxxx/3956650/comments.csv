The people who are ensnared in their traps need help. They have serious problems and this lousy show exploits their illness. In most cases, about 90% of those caught are released because it's proven to be entrapment. This show is a farce and should not be on the air because it's just for rating."
,mkarlmark,2008-01-02T02:29Z,"Tamarind... are you for real?
For a grown man to even think twice about sleeping with a child should put him behind bars.
There is no excuse in the world that can justify their actions. Those sick f*ckers should be taken out of their misery since there is no cure known to man that can treat pedophilia. Just like adults pursue other adults as sexual objects the pedophiles will continue to pursue children as sexual objects."
,johnniebrasco,2008-01-02T09:20Z,"Tamarind, only a pedophile can can come up with excuses for these fuckin sick bastards! They will never be cured, the only thing they will understand is a shot through the head!! And even if they are lured into a trap they are already on the web contacting kids. To talk? Think not. And if you really like kids in that way, I suggest you go out in the garage and bring a rope to hang yourself with. Only known cure. For the rest of the world that is."
,countryTM,2008-01-05T05:11Z,"I am from Perverted-Justice.com, these thing DO happen, alot. We do the work, Dateline covers the story, that's all. When I was 14, I thought a man that I met online loved me and now he's in prison. We do NOT entrap men, they have to initiate sex and meeting, not our decoys. Do your research before you flap your gumbs. "
,g21sf45,2008-01-05T22:12Z,"""...because they entrap people and create crimes that would most likely not exist otherwise.""

Are you really that out of touch with society? These types of crimes DO exist. They exist in every state in the US, and around the world. They happen on a daily basis and a lot of it goes unreported because the victims are sometimes too scared or embarrassed to go to the police (and even MORE afraid their parents will find out).
If it wasn't for news features like this, society would simply turn a blind eye to the problem, and these predators would continue to freely do what they do to kids."
,TV-Pirat,2008-01-13T03:05Z,"Tamarind is partially correct, these ""children"" are more or less temping these men to suggest a sexual relationship, where some of these men may not have had this in mind, but simply do it because of the ease. Like, I read this chat script on PeeJ - fleet_captain - how he told the supposedly underaged girl how she would be spanked if she were bad whereas she replied indifferently ""Yes"", I doubt a real child would agree to such. And he did, many times, ask her if she were really sure about it.
And yes, there are real predators just going to child after child to find someone willing, which they will eventually do.

And no, I am not by any means supporting child molesters."
,frequent980,2008-02-22T15:53Z,"The bigger crime is how much PEEEEEJ makes per arrest on tape. Cause of that the FBI brought an end to these kind of groups. Because of TACP more hardcore perves are gonna find different ways to prey on children and when a sting like this is operated, the demographic of people this is aimed at tend to get more violent. Besides, what's worse than a online predator? Someone who watches someone jackoff on a cam and then logs it all on a website. If any of these predators were smart they can make this argument ""prove to me the chatlogs have not been tampered with"" because printed documents are ALWAYS questionable and I WOULD NOT DOUBT Peeeeeeej is making phony documents. Gotta make raitings. Gotta make money.. Thankfully police departments are making task forces to take on this idea without millions of dollars to be made

BTW.. Ever notice how brand names are never blocked out and how McDonalds, Coke and Dr Pepper are always on camera? Think about it"
,frequent980,2008-02-22T16:24Z,"Oh and, if Del Harvey wants to come off as a real homosexual 14 year old boy she shouldn't talk in a deep gruffy voice. Not many homosexual underage males even have deep voices. "
[T],momamedienta,2008-03-20T08:51Z,"Perverted Justice has a 100% conviction rate for all cases where charges were brought.  They do not get a ""fee per bust on camera"".  They are paid a consultant fee when they work with Dateline.  However, there are many more stings done with law enforcement without media coverage."
,zenitram80,2008-07-14T10:16Z,"100% conviction rate? 24 of the guys who showed up in Murphy Texas weren't even prosecuted cause of the questioning of ethics (which ex NBC producer Marsha Bartell was fired for since she spoke out against Perverted Justice). So I guess 24 of them got away which shouldn't have happened if things were done right. All seems like trolling but idiots for fall for it should be in jail anyways.

Xavier Von Erck himself had said that they get a paid bonus for each bust. They're the ones bringing in the predators right? So who am I gonna believe. Someone online who claims it's not true or the creep himself who started it. 

(""it"" as in an organization where people pretend to be underage girls online and basically role play sexually though a minor is never involved).

Lots of police departments wont even work with them because of loopholes the public will look at causing the department to look bad.

Let's talk about how hypocritical NBC is. Ever heard of Jack McClellan? A self proclaimed child predator from California who likes to take voyeuristic photos of underage girls and post them online and where you can go to see these girls. He was interviewed by NBC in March of 2007 and during this interview he was to be confronted by a lawyer who was going to give him a restraining order issued by a judge. The restraining order stated that he couldn't be within 30 yards of a child at all times. 

NBC security protected Jack McClellan from being served and helped him to the parking lot without being confronted by this lawyer who was to serve him (and across the street to KFI). 

Now, how can a station such as NBC have a show such as ""To Catch A Predator"" when in the meantime help protect a child predator from being served with legal documents basically kicking him out of California? Rather hypocritical. Let's not bust the guy who's actually doing things physically and running a website telling other pervs where to see little girls 

If NBC settled in a lawsuit for ""Crossing the line"" for good tv then what else is going on? Good tv is good tv and people will do anything to get viewers which is understandable but eventually it has a price."
,Hei_på-deg,2008-10-21T22:24Z,this show is great to watch when you're high. Highly recommended =)
,Mahs,2008-11-29T01:11Z,"mkarlmark, You MUST be retarded? They DO have a problem, and they can't help it, do you think they really WANT to do it, or do you think they've got really strong urges.. Jeez, I agree, this show SHOULD be banned from TV"
,Limewood88,2009-01-26T12:14Z,"Cant someone upload all the episodes of ""To catch a predator""? Is so fu*cking fun to watch after a spliff=)"
,mormandy1,2009-04-18T02:12Z,"First, it is a form of entrapment. Let's face it, there aren't too many 12 year olds out there willing to discuss all sorts of explicit sex acts with some dirty old man or really anyone online. What is being created by the producers and the justice perverts, is an unreal situation where some 12 year old is all hot to trot and try all sorts of kinky things, which would almost never happen in real life. Odds are most of these guys would never actually do anything because this scenario would never be played out in real life. So it does bug me that the lives of families are ruined for what might well never have happened otherwise if it wasn't for this setup show. 

Secondly, don't get me wrong I believe pedophiles who molest should be executed. But I am saying I don't think many of these people would have ever actually done anything if not for this entrapment that would never happen in normal life.

Third, right or wrong, the show is a blast to watch. The look on the guys face when Chris Hanson walks in is just priceless, especially if the guy is sitting there spanking his monkey or something stupid.

In da butt!"
,AnalCrust,2010-06-14T06:05Z,"Oh no, someone tried to meet up with a 15 year old for a date!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL LOCK HIS ASS UP

This shit is ridiculous. Some 15 year old girls are extremely well built and dress more provocative than most women. Fuck this gay shit. Age is nothing but a number. I'm 23 and my fiance is 19. Who gives a shit about age? I love her, and I'd feel the exact same about her if she were 15."
,DearMrIce,2010-10-18T00:43Z,whereÂ´s all the female child molesters at?? i know that at least 4 women got entrapped during these investigations...but not on tape...no no ..all the good housemothers wouldnÂ´t do such horrible things...itÂ´s just men who are child molesters....if a hot 15 year old girl came on to me that way?...I could honestly say that i would reconsider the options....that dont make me a child molester....just a testosteron filled man....what about girls in the legal age that look like 15 yo????then its allright ....
,malachai01,2010-11-19T07:43Z,"All you guys saying this is entrapment and blah blah blah dont have a fking clue what you're talking about.
Look up entrapment.
If I'm a cop, walk up to someone and say hey wanna buy some drugs? If they say sure, I can arrest them - that's NOT entrapment.
Entrapment is if I walk up to someone and say ""Hey, mister, please buy these drugs my wife is really sick. Even if you throw them in the dumpster please, I really need the money"" and then the defendant eventually, reluctantly agrees (it's clear he wanted the drugs because I convinced him) THAT is entrapment.

To sum up, giving the opportunity to commit a crime is NOT entrapment.

Entrapment is to cause someone to commit a crime that they would NOT ordinarily commit. IE not just creating the opportunity for them to commit a crime, but actively convincing them to do so.

It is my understanding that perverted justice is very conscious NOT to initiate contact with these guys, or suggest meeting them, or suggest sexually explicit conversation.

The guys are already online, contacting children, openly talking about sex and meeting up. If it wasnt perverted justice they chatted to, it'd be a real child instead."
