  The Sperminator
  
  The Sperminator investigates how under the pretence of good 
medicine, Dr Cecil Jacobson, a British-trained fertility expert, 
helped dozens of women in the small community of Alexandria, Virginia
in the US to have babies. The documentary uncovers how he neglected
to tell the happy parents one crucial fact - he was the father. When
his deception finally came to light, investigators suspected that
Jacobson had fathered up to 75 local children. And while many of his
victims were appalled, he seemed to think he had done nothing wrong -
and his wife has always stood by him. This film examines why such a
respected doctor turned his back on good medicine.
