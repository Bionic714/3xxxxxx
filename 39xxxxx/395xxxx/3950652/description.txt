+----Album Information----+
On its 2007 debut, THE NEW REIGN, the Chicago-based extreme-metal 
band Born of Osiris unleashes a fierce aural assault. 
While the group sports demonic vocals, bludgeoning guitar riffs, and rapid-fire rhythms, 
it also indulges in the occasional melodic, 
prog-influenced keyboard line (see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Open Arms to Damnation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), 
making it an intriguingly unpredictable act.
