_____________________________________________________________Summary__

China's sky-rocketing growth and shortage of sufficient resources is
forcing China to set its sights outside its borders in a frantic
search for oil, but the major oil-producing countries are kept
off-limits by the United States, forcing China to do business with
the rogue states, African dictatorships, Iran and former Russian
states - to get the oil they desperately need.
Featuring field encounters, archival footage, news reports and maps
to outline the latest threat in world geopolitics.
