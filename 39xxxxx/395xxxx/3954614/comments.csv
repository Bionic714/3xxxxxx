,satmancan,2007-12-31T02:37Z,"i was just curious what program do you use for the mp4 conversion? The reason i ask i just got a zune. I was exited to get one until i got it and found out it was just like the ipod by which i mean it only plays a couple of formats , wmv and mp4. I still have a creative zen vision m which plays everything but i wanted to use the zune for its larger screen. I am having a hell of a time finding good software to convert my 1.4 terabyte collection. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.....Thanks"
,DivorcedWithChildren,2007-12-31T09:30Z,"Aimersoft MP4 Video Converter is what I used simply because it was very easy to install.  I downloaded it as a torrent, installed the ""trial"" version, didn't run the program.  Then took the primary exe file from the ""crack"" file and substituted it for the ""trial"" exe, which is quite small.  It worked just fine, has lots of settings to play with.  MP4 doesn't seem to like Black & White films.  I tried 2 different MP4 converters on ""Longest Day"" and it quadrupled it's size.  Don't know why.  But for ordinary color films, it seems to do very well with keeping high video quality and reducing the file size.  AT&T is using MP4 in their Uverse TV over IP as I understand it.  Aimersoft MP4 Convert supports these files:  avi, mp4, mpeg, mpg, 3gp, wmv, asf, rm, rmvb, dat, mov, flv, and will also convert music files:  mp3, wav, m4a, and wma.  It will take MP4 files and convert them back into an AVI but doesn't do anything else as far as converting MP4 files into something else.  However, it has some neet settings:  brighter, darker, louder etc. which after some practice, could improve on a poorly copied AVI or whatever."

,DivorcedWithChildren,2008-01-01T03:18Z,Oops.  My bad.  Someone corrected me.  Undertow was released in 2004.  The 1994 date is incorrect.  Sorry all.  Jamie Bell isn't that old.
,jgabriel,2008-01-02T03:25Z,"DWC: ""The MP4 converter joined the two AVIs and compressed it to about 1/3 of it's original size. [...] I'd appreciate comments:  ...  so I can make changes when I convert my AVI movies to MPG4 but I think most people will enjoy the shorter downloads, particularly for the older or less popular films that I tend to like to seed.""

Agreed, I think this is a good idea in general.

However, MP4, in general, is designed to compress down to about half the size of an AVI. At 1/3 the size, you might be overcompressing the file.

If you're getting near identical results to the original files, great, no problem. But you may want to take a closer look at the files - 1/3 of the avi file size suggests you might be losing about 30% of the video quality.

Unless you're also compressing from 5.1 to stereo sound; that could also account for almost 30% of the file size differences?
