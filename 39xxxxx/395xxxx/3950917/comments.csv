,jacon6,2007-12-29T00:23Z,"My thought was that it would be an easy way to get all this good rockstar games in one package, and that I found many GTA torrents that wasnÂ´t working, or you had to do some configuration in the recovery mode on your psp. 
I hope these ones work :) they did for me, and thats the reason I uploaded. 
I really see your point, I hope this one gets appreciated though.

Anyway, thx, and cheers to you to"

Are you using custom firmwire?
Let me know if you get it right.

Anyone else got problems with the Warriors?
I did of course tried all the games on my PSP(m33-4)before I uploaded, so they should work just fine.

And to all who dont know remember to set your ""UMD ISO mode"" to M33 driver, by pressing ""SELECT"" in XMB before you enter the game, something that pretty much must be done in order to play any game.

If anyone else got problems, just comment and I try to help. :)"
,unusingur,2008-02-11T01:32Z,"i searched for the warriors for too long now, i can't wait to have it!!! hope it fits on my 2gb stick, this was quite shocking to see it has 2gb. if it doesn't fit then i will take out some sounds, i guess..."
,jacon6,2008-02-11T22:26Z,"The warriors will fit on a 2gb stick, dont know why it says 2gb in the files list. Its actually 1.52gb :? Hope you like it anyway, I love that game!"
,scarletspydr,2008-02-28T07:01Z,Fantastic torrent. Really impressive to see someone go through the work of actually putting together something that makes sense. Good job. I'll be seeding this one for awhile.
,jacon6,2008-02-28T09:51Z,Thanks :)
,arbie,2008-03-07T13:42Z,how to seed and what is seed??PLZ TELL ME AND REPLY TO ME
,jacon6,2008-03-08T17:52Z,"Hello arbie.
It means that you should upload what you dowload.
You will see your upload ratio on each torrent you download, make that Ratio at least 1.0 and you're good!
And it's an process that starts automatic, so its nothing to worry about.

Good luck!

,bwscte4life,2008-03-30T23:51Z,do these game work on ps3 if i put them on a memory stick and copy to it????? i'm thinking this because when you download a game from the PS store it works on PS3 and PSP. PLEEEEEEEEEEASE LET ME KNOW!!!! THANKS
,jacon6,2008-04-10T10:23Z,"Hello bwscte4life

I dont think it can be done.
Sure if you could get an eboot file or alike into the game section on your PS3, then maybe. 
But the PS3 only recognise files like videos, pictures and music to be transferred.

Im not sure about this, but me myself have no idea how to get anything into the gamesection on the PS3, (except saved game files) that isn't downloaded or bought from PSN."
,CATS3Y3,2008-04-15T13:03Z,"Ok just so everyone knows, the games iso and cso games you download come from sony's umds, which hold  A MAXIMUM OF 1.8 GB. that means that no game is over 1.79 gigabytes.
also for those who actually know how to run an iso, access your psp's recovery menu and set your cpu speed to 333 for game. leave your vsh speed at 222"
,bwscte4life,2008-04-15T23:48Z,thanks jacon6 !
,kimih96,2008-05-04T18:42Z,can you upload these games separately
,jacon6,2008-05-10T13:20Z,"No need to upload seperatly.
The games is not put into one big rar, so you can just pick which ever one you want.
Your torrent client uselley gives you the option to choose files before starting to download.
And Im still seeding this one so if you want a game, just grab one :)"
,The Reaper,2008-06-03T12:10Z,"thx for the torrent! been looking for warriors for a while.. :P these are all unripped, right?"
,jacon6,2008-06-06T01:38Z,"You mean if they are full games right?
I haven't made these UMDrips myself, only share them.
All of the games seem to be full, but GTA VCS must have some stripped comercials on the radio or something, cause you can find uploads that is larger then this one.
I haven't noticed anything though, so its a good job done to save some space.
But leave a comment if you would find any problem.
Well, enjoy the warriors mate!"

,jacon6,2008-06-15T03:34Z,"nekrogummies

You need to have custom firmware installed. 
Do a search on it and you find plenty of info.
I do not recommend to try installing yourself if you dont know what you are doing :)
You can have this done fore a small amount of money at many places, and custom firmware gives you many more features then just being able to play downloaded games.
You can put many homebrewed softwares on you psp to make it real interesting!
Good luck to you!"
,jacon6,2008-06-15T14:12Z,"nekrogummies

I see now that your problem is to get the games IN to the psp, you maybe allready have CFW?
Well if, then just connect to your PC and put downloaded games in the ISO folder in the root of your PSP.
Dont have an ISO folder, just make one.
By the way, you do allways get access to your PSP via ""My Computer"", from there you click on the removable disc that should be your PSP.
I hope it works out for you."
,jacon6,2008-07-23T21:58Z,"Just reached 1 Tb upload on this one, and will keep seeding ofc :)"
