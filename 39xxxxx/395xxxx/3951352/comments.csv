,babylaton,2007-12-30T18:18Z,hey can anyone upload stf part one i never heard of this before but would be interested to see it would be very greatfull
[V],brokep,2007-12-31T00:33Z,the previous movie is available on the site at http://thepiratebay.org/user/stealthisfilm just as this one is.
,death734,2007-12-31T20:07Z,NTSC or PAL format?
,littleyaheco,2008-01-01T01:04Z,Just finished watching it. The music was not as good the part 1 but the content was top notch. I am a little sad that the iso just drops you in to the video. I would of really liked a menu like most dvds have.  
,c0pypaste,2008-01-01T21:29Z,"brokep... Can it be the link to PART 1 is not working? All attempts to download PART 1 in ISO gives me this error in uTorrent: ""No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it"".

PART II was a smooth download. Great film! Now seeding!"
,Crysis69,2008-01-01T22:29Z,Download Bitcomet
,c0pypaste,2008-01-04T15:25Z,*update* The tracker for PART I is working for me now (using uTorrent). Finally! Three days later! Don't know what happened there.
,tdktank59,2008-01-08T00:30Z,Awesome movies expected them to be more about illegal filesharing aspects but the real reason was more about social change and whats going on now...

,fruityloop7,2010-04-23T00:47Z,"Thank god copyright laws were invented!! The world must have been so boring with writers, painters, musicians and filmmakers sitting around unwilling to create anything cus noone had invented copyright laws yet!
As soon as copyright laws were invented all those creative types started making interesting stuff - just so they could earn shit loads of money!!!"
