,JoeFish2001,2008-01-06T09:39Z,Sorry :( No Subtitles
,moleman16,2008-01-07T17:49Z,I was wondering if anyone knows how to maybe split the file and burn it on two DVD's. Or is there another way to do this.
,JoeFish2001,2008-01-08T08:36Z,you can use dvdshrink to make it fit onto a single dvd+r
,torrentbrah,2008-01-12T21:13Z,"can anyone please help me? im learning all of this torrent info myself and need some guidance. i have this downloaded and its in a folder called ""VIDEO_TS""  i dont know if this is a format to burn on to dvd or what. someone, anyone please help your fellow seeder."
,torrentbrah,2008-01-12T21:45Z,"ok....i just posted that speel about not knowing what to do. i looked around a found that the VLC media player works somehow...i still dont know why or how it works, but it does and im happy now :)....if anyone would like to educate me i'll still listen :)"
,a2zeno,2008-01-13T21:28Z,"First of all let me thank JoeFish2001 for making this available to download, second I would like to thank all the seeders for helping me get past the 7.06 Gigs quite seemlessly. But, I'm having the same problem as torrentbrah and I don't have the vlc-media plaer. Is there any other way? or should I just fork over the cash and get it?"
,spoogmonster,2008-01-14T05:37Z,"Use dvd shrink to shrink the file enough that it fits on a 4.7 gb. disk create an iso backup file and then use DVD decrypter to burn the image on a dvd . this should form the file structure needed including an audio TS folder.Works for me.dvd decrypter and dvd shrink 3.2 are both easily freeware ,easy to get and easy  to understand have a ball---------------------------"
,torrentbrah,2008-01-14T07:37Z,"the vlc media player is free, and actually is pretty cool.....i use that and watched it...its amazing...im not sure if u mean fork over cash for the VLC or for the actual DVD but vlc is free. i also downloaded codec and shit too at the same time as vlc....m not sure if tyhat had anything to do with it....as i said, im new to all this and am loving the shit out of finding out more...idk why its just fun."
,torrentbrah,2008-01-14T09:19Z,quick question...is DVDR a format for  burning on to DVD?? like is made to burn to dvd opposed to just watching it on ur pc? i havent burned any dvds ever and want to have knowledge before make some blanks worthless... 
,joebob9,2008-03-09T04:03Z,"what's the quality of this?
What region is it? (pal/ntsc)
What audio streams are there? (audio quality)
DD5.1 I hope.
Thanks for information please"
,bmaasth,2008-03-09T06:05Z,"The quality was great but when I used DVDShrink to compress it to a DVD-5 it made the screen pixelate horribly.  Many thanks to JoeFish2001 though, I just watched it via the hard drive."
,As-lalle-naeb,2008-07-10T01:32Z,seed please

,Mr.Ninja,2009-02-05T21:31Z,"Get Power DVD to play .ISO/.IMG and vob files.
When you mount it thru Daemon tools it can be played as a regular DVD with menues and all.

Best of luck to all of you."
