_____________________________________________________________Summary__

Ernesto Che Guevara, the world's most famous revolutionary, was killed
in October 1967 under mysterious circumstances. Today, 40 years later,
his image is the twenty-first century' best-selling icon anywhere. Yet
his myth has lost nothing of its force. Upon his death, Che remains
vanished for more than 30 years. Was this disappearance an attempt to
avoid the creation of an even more powerful historical legend? This
film shows the last hours of Che Guevara, the reasons that led to the
disappearance and the recovery of his remains through archives and
witnesses, as well as the recovery of the body and the role that the
vanished corpse with its amputated hands played in the creation of
the legend of Che.
