Once again in 2004, TiÃ«sto has left his mark on the history of dance music when he returned with a new series of TiÃ«sto In Concert. This time he has outdone himself by doing 2 shows in Arnhem, Holland (October 29th and 30th) and a show in Hasselt, Belgium (November 6th), sharing his music and vision with over 70,000 fans. 

The theme of the 2004 shows is Magik, a word which has become sort of a trademark for the 3-time-in-a-row winner of DJ Magazines Top 100 list. All sorts of 'Magik' were incorporated into the shows, complimenting TiÃ«sto's sounds with visual entertainment and grandeur. Also several guest performers showcased their talents by performing with and alongside TiÃ«sto during the night, such as Matt Hales from Aqualung and violin player DJ Mason to name a few, not forgetting the unique images of Micha Klein, the Bulgarian Children of Orpheus choir, loads of fireworks and more... 

This 3-hour registration shows you TiÃ«sto In Concert 2004 in a way a dance-event never before has been captured, showing you the event from all corners of the stadium, and let's you relive as if you're a part of the audience. It's simply Magik!"
