Marvel Romance redux




Marvel Romance Redux has combined the two low-selling genres of romance and humor â?? or rather, used romance comics as a template for pure amusement. Here, Marvel
has taken the original art of old romance stories it owns, including Patsy Walker stories, and written new words in the existing word balloons and narration blocks. It canâ??t be too easy a task, telling a whole story and making it funny within the given structure, but this actually works â?? mostly by the sheer silliness of making fun of the art in a panel and of the mod fashions of the time, allusions to sex, and sending up the whole romance style, but youâ??ll find a variety of other laughs as well. Each issue contains around five or six stories that are just short enough so that the running gags donâ??t get tiring.
