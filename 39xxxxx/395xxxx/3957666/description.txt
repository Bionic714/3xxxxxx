This is really cool and only for XP.
Just click on the TrueTransparency.exe in this folder and the windows will have transparency, like in Vista!
*If you want to stop it just end the TrueTransparency.exe in the task manager




Also see my WinFlip torrent, it lets you flip through your open items like in Vista
