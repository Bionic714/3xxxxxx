* First 4 episodes are from season 1, episodes 5-9 are from season 2, episodes 10-14 are from season 3 and the ones numbered 15-19 are from season 4.
Anyway, they are all in chronological order so this doesn't really matter.
* Each episode has chapters for a easier navigation.
* Don't worry about the mkv format, all you need is Haali Media Splitter and ffdshow.
* If you want a all in one solution, I recommend Combined Community Codec Pack http://www.cccp-project.net/
* The US DVD release really sucks! I had to use a whole lot of deinterlacing strategies, each episode needing a different approach.
Even if the quality could have been better, I worked a lot on these so I hope you like them!
