I Am Legend REPACK DVDSCR XviD-iMBT

Our original post for leaked dvd screener of I Am Legend became somehow complicated and with almost 700 comments by far the most read article on this site. The situation is now pretty much clear: the only proper, scene version is this rip from iMBT. There are no problems with audio syncing or watermarks (itÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s cropped though) as in case of previous rips. The quality is simply excellent considering itÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s a really new movie. Oh and by the way, we were linked by numerous established websites including the New York Magazine on this post.  

Robert Neville is a brilliant scientist, but even he could not contain the terrible virus that was unstoppable, incurable, and man-made. Somehow immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City and maybe the world. For three years, Neville has faithfully sent out daily radio messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. But he is not alone. Mutant victims of the plague Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Infected Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ lurk in the shadowsÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã?Â¦ watching NevilleÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s every moveÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã?Â¦ waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankindÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But he knows he is outnumberedÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã?Â¦ and quickly running out of time
