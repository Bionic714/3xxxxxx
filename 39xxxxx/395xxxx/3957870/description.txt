Gravy Train!!!! appeals to fans of John Waters, the B-52's, Gary Glitter, L'Trimm, and sex education films. Their live show--which has been known to include food-flinging, rapid sequined-costume changes, and synchronized dance routines--inspires slobbering groupies male and female to get in touch with their inner Catholic school slut.
