if it spans an entire year that's roughly 40 x 12, give/take as some stay some change.... but it looks like a good bit of techno type tracks, I didn't check the read me which might explain why they are here as many of these songs definitly don't fit into top 40, but none the less i picked out the ones I wanted, thanks!"

Great list :-) Thx."
,KingCopy,2009-03-12T19:39Z,"Mupp25 is right, why do you call it an top 40 list if there are 270 songs in it. Oh and there's an other problem the download stops at 98% so I'm stuck with 100 uncompleted songs. But I don't know if it's your fault."
