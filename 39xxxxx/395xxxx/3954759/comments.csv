,IttoDaigoro,2008-01-01T05:50Z,I'm a fan of the Coens and I've never heard of this movie.  Thanks.
[T],metalcore.,2008-01-02T08:06Z,this is NOT a coens bros film...it is directed by SAM RAIMI
[T],_Maelstrom_,2008-01-02T17:43Z,As stated in the nfo this film was co-written by Joel and Ethan Coen.
,samg001,2008-05-12T01:55Z,"Sam Raimis second film, made shortly after the release of The Evil Dead.  First title was 'The XYZ Murders' and retitled before release."
,charleshamm,2008-07-10T21:07Z,"crimewave is only ok.
but it could be brilliant.
written by sam raimi & the coen brothers.
but the company didn't let them do the film
they wanted.
a lot of compromises where made.
the leading role was written for
bruce campbell but he was given a much
smaller part.

sam raimi & the coen brothers worked together
on the hudsucker proxy as well"
