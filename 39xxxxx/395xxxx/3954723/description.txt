`Poop-poop!' - Toad, Ratty, Mole, Badger and the rest are brought into intricate, 
brilliant stop-motion life in this 1983 feature from Cosgrove Hall.

All the major elements of Kenneth Grahame's tale are in their proper place - the Wild Wood, Toad messing about with motor cars, the Courthouse, the Gaol - but there is an added ingredient which lifts this up above previous adaptations, and indeed, most subsequent efforts.  It has atmosphere.  Lots of it.

The riverfront world of the novel has been beautifully captured.  The models are exquisitely tailored and dressed, the homes filled with implements, knick-knacks, artworks and paraphenelia scaled down to minute proportions, the countryside rich with a variety of flora and fauna.

The classic story of the adventures of Mole, Badger, Rat and Toad of Toad Hall, set in Edwardian England of 1908 (when Kenneth Grahame published the original book).
