I'll be seeding for some days until availability is about 3. After that I'm counting on you guys.... 
Cheers"
,aiglos357,2008-01-07T15:44Z,"Great upload, catman.
I remember rushing home from school to watch this when I was a kid.
This isn't the English-dubbed version, but Japanese with English subtitles.
This is a little racier than the American version, the robot Analyzer keeps lifting up Yoki's skirt and grabbing her ass. You also see her naked when they're making the first warp between the moon and Mars. 
Thanks a lot, I'll keep seeding."
,CarboCookie,2008-01-08T04:07Z,"Thank you!

Feel free to post as much anime from the Leijiverse as you can, this stuff is damn near impossible to find outside Japan."
,catman77,2008-01-14T14:25Z,"Many thanks for your comments everyone!
Looks like there are many people that downloads it so I hope that it will be available for all the other Start Blazers lovers to come so they do not need to struggle like I did to find it. 

I'm about 11 episodes away to have all of series 2. However some of them do no have any active seeders (one person that pops up and down every now and then). I think it will take at least two more weeks until I have them all. 

I also got some of the movies. But I need to sort them out as some are the US version and some are the Japanese version. Some are dubbed and some are not.
I will share them later on.. :-)
Cheers"

,Taotoad,2008-02-02T17:24Z,"Superb!

Does anyone have the soundtrack to this show? I can't find it anywhere."
,pookiespa,2008-02-04T18:44Z,Does anyone know where to get the rest of the series?  I have a 1 year old who's just got to experience this show when she's older!
,yrah,2008-04-30T04:53Z,Great stuff. I'd say keep up the good work but you already have.
,rockowillis,2008-08-24T21:19Z,"If you want to find everything that has to do with Star Blazers (including an awsome web comic) just hit www.starblazers.com

This is the official website for Star Blazers and anything to do with it. They have links to diagrams and pictures of all the ships and tons of pics. I believe they have the largest collection of SB pics, period.

Jump over there and take a look..."
,gabya,2009-01-10T16:38Z,"could someone seed?

,bliss-junkie,2009-02-05T15:01Z,thanks catman77 for season 2. Loved this show as a kid. Looking for season 3. I've seeded all the music I have for others as requested.
,subaiku,2009-10-25T15:54Z,may i ask if this is the original japanese with english subs?... thanks!
,Pappy1514,2009-11-29T22:31Z,"Right on man I have been looking for this for some time. It was a dam great series back in the day.

Keep seeding people as I will be seeding for as long as is possible."
,Pappy1514,2009-11-30T21:44Z,"I found Season 3 but it is on a Private Tracker. 

Go to Google and type in:
Space Battleship Yamato (Star Blazers) Season 3

Look for the ""BakaBT"" torrent site.

Enjoy and please resseed at least 1.0 or 7 days."
,funtimes719,2010-03-11T11:49Z,"Just uploaded the US version here. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5427705

I'll try and seed it, but its my first torrent, so I might not have it correct? Let me know"
,seiryu13,2011-08-11T20:57Z,"Thanks very much for uploading this.  I've been on a collecting craze recently, looking for old classics like this.  "
