Can someone please seed the version of ranma that playes on Real Player (with rm & rmvb files)
It is the only version I can play on my computer without it skipping...."

,mattyc82,2010-09-10T01:59Z,"how the fuck does anybody ever expect to download a 30GB torrent if they themselves dont seed. 

its just so slow for everybody.  if it takes 5 weeks to get down, we are all using more power than what hiring the DVDs would cost."
,Sebbychan,2012-04-12T00:48Z,Will happily seed this (and other anime) as soon as it is downloaded.
