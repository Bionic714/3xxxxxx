,yadayadaya,2008-05-20T15:19Z,"Lil Wayne greatest rapper alive???  LOL, children.  Not even on his best day.  Greatest imitator alive maybe.  Jay-Z starts using his last name of Carter, so little Jay, I mean Wayne decides to do it.  Jay-Z calls himself the best rapper alive repeatedly, so Wayne decides to do it.  He even admitted he wanted to be like Jay-Z."
