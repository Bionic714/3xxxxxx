,david.alves,2008-06-16T03:38Z,"Hey king_rat
Any chance the BoM will be up soon? Kind of in a rush to get it, but I only download torrents from Pirate Bay...
Thanks man!"
,king_rat,2008-06-16T09:58Z,Not likely - the BoM isn't really that impressive mechanically.  Its more like a setting book for the Paragons universe than it is a collection of how to run magic in an MnM game.
,david.alves,2008-06-17T04:06Z,"Ok man, thanks for the advice!
And mind if I'm so bold to ask, would you mind in giving me some pointers? I'm new to Pirate Bay, and BitTorrent and this stuff...But I would like to contribute with it too. How can I upload, or how can I help distribute those files?
Thank you for answering me so quickly!"
,Greasyzer0,2008-09-03T15:52Z,Seed please. Interested in the M&M gaming style. I realy want the source and crooks!. found a game were they want us to be vampires. So please seed. And thank you for the torrent.
,DjembeTheBard,2012-01-08T06:37Z,"Seed, please? It's currently downloading at 1kbps. Unless anyone knows a newer torrent? I'm only after the core rulebook.
Thanks in advance."
