Andreas Vollenweider - Eolian Minstrel (1993)


After a two-year break from recording, Swiss harpist Andreas Vollenweider returned with Eolian Minstrel, which marks a radical reworking of his music. The most obvious departure is the composer's collaboration with lyricists/vocalists Eliza Gilkyson (on most tracks) and Carly Simon (on one). In keeping with this conversion to the song form, Vollenweider has added a new perkiness to his music, so it sounds less like Yanni and more like Kenny G.
