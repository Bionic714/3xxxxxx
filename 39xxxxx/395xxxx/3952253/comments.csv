""Setup cannot continue because a required file is corrupted or not available,  Run Setup again from the original source disc or download location""

,ParticleX,2008-01-14T09:11Z,"it works.

mounted with PowerISO and installed without hitches. only problem is i did waited longer than it took me to install a copy of Office 2003 (maybe it upgraded my office 2k3 so it took a little while)

great job!"
,ratty2e,2008-01-15T01:02Z,"Thanks xakepaT
AVG says it's clean, installs fine. If you need to install to other than your %System%\%ProgramFiles% folder you need to run ""Setup.exe /admin"" util to amend location in .MSP file in ""Update"" folder. See Microsoft site for details. This editions so cool I'm considering buying an official one for work. Off to walk the plank now...."
