_____________________________________________________________Summary__

Never before have journalists been the target of violence to the 
degree they are now in Iraq. This documentary looks at how kidnappings
and decapitations have become a real threat to those practising this 
profession. The Iranian-Canadian documentary filmmaker and news 
correspondent Maziar Bahari discusses the effect violence has had on 
the lives of journalists, and how it influences their work. 
Correspondent Hannah Allam explains to what extent violence has 
penetrated her life. Her interpreter's family was murdered and a 
colleague was shot at an American checkpoint. Nevertheless, Hannah 
continues with her work, albeit with very limited freedom of movement.
Canadian journalist Scott Taylor was abducted and tortured in Iraq. 
Still, he travels back to Iraq, but this time embedded, to tell the 
soldiers about his experiences and to confront one of his kidnappers.
Also featured in Targets: Reporters In Iraq is Giuliana Sgrena, the 
Italian journalist whose rescuer died during her ride to freedom and 
the Frenchman Christian Chesnot who was also abducted.
