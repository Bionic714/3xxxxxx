   Harry Potter actress Emma Watson makes her TV debut in this feature-
   length adaptation of Noel Streatfeild's classic novel. Set in London 
   during the 1930s, it tells the story of orphans Pauline, Petrova and 
   Posy Fossil, who are adopted by eccentric explorer Gum ? although it's
   his selfless niece Sylvia who does most of the hard work involved in 
   raising them. The girls face further upheaval when their guardian 
   disappears, and the cash-strapped Sylvia is forced to take in lodgers, 
   but despite their impoverished circumstances, the sisters still have 
   grand plans. Pauline yearns to be an actress, Petrova dreams of becoming
   a pilot and Posy is a born ballerina ? but with no money, it looks like
   some of their ambitions will have to be sacrificed if they want to stay 
   together. Victoria Wood, Richard Griffiths and Marc Warren also star. 
   The script is by Heidi Thomas, whose period drama Lillies aired in 
   early 2007
