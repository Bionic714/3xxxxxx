In British colonial America, Captain Swanson's adherence to the rules results in Trader Callendar's selling rum to the Indians under cover of a government permit. Jim Smith won't sit still for that. He organizes troopers to dress up as Indians and intercept the shipments which, of course, gets him thrown in jail. Written by Ed Stephan {stephan@cc.wwu.edu}
