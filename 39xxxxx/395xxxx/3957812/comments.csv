,rstev39147,2008-01-02T19:04Z,"Ha, sorry man, I didn't think about it.  I wouldn't want to bother asking you to do it anyway, it only took about 5 minutes to add.  No problem, it's not my release it's yours!"
,etlitch,2008-01-04T15:46Z,"still requires serial key if you install on windows
setup cannot continue during bootinstall because sp3.cab is corrupted or missing
computer cannot boot from this  have to swap with an xp cd first.

most useless shit ever. 1 dvd wasted."
,ghbryans,2008-01-04T23:03Z,Why don't you try it with Virtual PC 2007 before you waste a DVD????

,bergslag,2008-01-17T04:21Z,"this is what i wrote to liluser..the same goes for 
your version...you do not support 
SATA..........not the drivers from intel..

great work liluser but....
like other xp mod. it is not working with SATA.
You have to adjust bios sata mode to ""compatible"" because 
if you use SATA AHCI Mode the the installation will get as 
far as getting to chose where to install it...it shows my 
usb harddrive but not my SATA harddrive.
When running compatible it is just IDE, slow harddrive.
The only xp working with SATA is black xp 7.2
But the have done a custom made installation

But black xp is not good, lots of stuff pre-installed. Your version is the best. Xp with 3264 and vista sidebar...no more 
So pleeeaze fix the problem with the SATA

when i look in device manager in vista (which support SATA from start)
i find to things, first the achi controller and than the storage controller.
perhaps you can check it out some more, i think black xp is using 
the drivers from the links below...

Intel 82801 HEM SATA AHCI Controller

intel ich8m ultra ata storage controllers 2850
