Xandros 4 - Open Circulation Edition DVD

The Open Circulation Edition is a limited version of Xandros Desktop OS that can be freely distributed. It includes all the easy-to-use features of the Xandros Desktop OS Deluxe and Business editions, including four-click install with automatic disk partitioning, industry-leading hardware detection and configuration, seamless file and print sharing on Windows networks, and drag-and-drop CD burning in Xandros File Manager.

The principal differences between the Open Circulation Edition Desktop OS and the commercial editions of Xandros are as follows:

   * The Open Circulation Edition may be freely distributed.
   * CD burning speed in Xandros File Manager is limited to the minimum burning speed.
   * The Open Circulation Edition installs an ad-sponsored version of the Opera web browser and e-mail client.
   * You may access the Xandros user forums but you are not entitled to e-mail installation support.
   * No user guide is included with the Open Circulation Edition.
   * The Open Circulation Edition does not include CodeWeavers CrossOver Office or Plugins so you are not able to run any Windows compatible applications on Xandros Desktop.
