,81hotrod,2007-12-31T21:11Z,It's not even released yet.
,swabs,2007-12-31T21:29Z,"I understand your doubt, but i've been flying this for weeks now.  it came from emule and there is no doubt that it is PMDG md-11, with full panel and one livery only - maybe a beta model but it sure works well. At the moment i'm having trouble seeding the thing."
,Panodilo,2007-12-31T22:20Z,"Hey, I tried that Terrabuilder moon expansion. Read my instructions for the workaround. The configurator didn't work, remember? Fuck y'all and have a great happy new year. I'll be back next year, or in forty minutes whichever scares you the least, to jizz all over you. *squirts copiously on everyone*

Slumped over in someone's couch
Unable to squeeze out a drunken fart
Who put a gerbil up there? Ouch!"
,PHBFO,2008-01-01T16:44Z,"Probably the pack with the iFDG model and a very early BETA version of the 2D panel, that's all"
,krodrig1,2008-01-21T21:56Z,The original Beta 1 that came out what seems eons ago was just under 10 Megs in size. This one hoewver is 33.6 Megs. I wonder how this one came about? Any other users got feedback? How about some seeders.
