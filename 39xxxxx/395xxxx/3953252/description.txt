Discover Your Spirit Animal


With powerful music and words; Ted Andrews guides you into the realm of spirit animal encounters. Through years of work with animals and music, Ted combines archetypal imagery with powerful music to elicit tremendous results. 
 	Drums, flutes, organ and synthesizer are combined in a powerful and moving composition. Two versions are provided. One version is a guided journey with music. The other version is music only. This can be played and enjoyed by itself. Most people who have done a guided journey like to adapt it and work with it a more unique way. The music-only version will facilitate this. All words, music and instruments are composed and performed by Ted Andrews.
