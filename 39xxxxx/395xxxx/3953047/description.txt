The Brussels Workshop

New EU legislation emphasises and in some cases creates new crimes of consumer infringement of intellectual property laws. Consumer Warnings about consumers' requirements to respect copyright could become mandatory; worse, such infringement cases could move from civil cases to criminal ones across the EU. But nowhere is there legislation either clarifying or defending consumers' rights under IP law, in our changing digital environment.

Consumer privacy suffers from the same trend. Telecommunications companies now must store private information on consumer phone calls and e-mails for the use of European law enforcement. A recent proposal would also store consumers' air travel data for 13 years, providing access to governments both here and outside the EU. But where are the laws forcing IT companies to respect our privacy?

This session will have a closer look at these proposals, and what you can do about them.
