  LIBERIA: AN UNCIVIL WAR

In Liberia, the summer of 2003 was pure insanity when a rebel army 
attempted to overthrow a government run by an indicted war criminal.
Two armies engaged in the final battle of a decade long civil war.
Hundreds of innocent civilians died from mortar shells launched from
afar and thousands more suffered hunger while the soldiers, mostly
teenagers, kept the capital city under siege. This documentary 
investigates one of the many brutal civil wars that were being raged
across Africa. Liberia: An Uncivil War follows reporters, Jonathan
Stack and James Barbazon as they investigated the power struggle
between the rebel movement LURD (Liberians United for Reconciliation
and Democracy) and President Charles Taylor as it reached its climax
with the imminent capture of Liberian capital Monrovia in the summer
of 2003. While Stack followed the besieged government, Brabazon
entrenched himself with rebels as they advance on Monrovia.
