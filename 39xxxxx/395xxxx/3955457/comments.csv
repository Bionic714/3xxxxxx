,Djsanz,2008-07-04T19:12Z,"to curlyq101, download poweriso which enables you to set up a virtual drive. Burn the iso image file to a disc. Open file window on disc right click iso file go to power iso > mount image to drive. Now, close this go to my computer and drives window click on virtual drive and your image file should open up with unpacked applications and stuff. "
