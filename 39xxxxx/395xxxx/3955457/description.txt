Who doesn't know it - the cult game, "The incredible MachineÂ®", - the one that captivated many computer gamers. So...DIY freaks, logical thinkers, and superbrains get ready! Moulded along the lines of that classic is yet another gem - "Crazy Machines - The Inventor's Workshop" - and this one will test your logic and inventive talent to the limits. 

The task sounds easy enough, doesn't it? With the given parts, construct a machine that matches the objective of the game; but, as always, there are hidden pitfalls in there - how can I grill meat using a light bulb?, or, how can I get a flower to grow using a cannon or gun? These are all questions that you can answer during the game!

"Crazy Machines" won't only test your brainpower â€“ it has features like particle systems, volumetric realtime shadows, clothing simulation â€“ and you won't be able to get enough of the incredibly detailed machine parts designed by the prize-winning design team "DBKI" - graphics both powerful and impressive.
