,Ima_User,2008-01-06T21:06Z,"I burned NTSC (US) using Nero Vision.  I can't select menus, and it jumps right in to Spanish.  I don't think PAL is supported on standard US DVD players and/or TVs (tell me if I am wrong.)

Also, audio does not seem to want to play in digital audio mode - only plays center channel.  I'm sure I am doing something wrong.


Has anyone else had this problem?  How did you fix it?  Thanks!  And thanks for the upload skafa."

Audio is waaaaaaaay out of synch with video.

No, conversion went correctly."
