Damien Echols interview from Death Row on Larry King Live, December 19th, 2007.


Background:

The West Memphis 3 are three men (teenagers at the time) tried and convicted for the murders of three children in the Robin Hood Hills area of West Memphis, Arkansas, United States in 1993.

Echols is currently seeking new trial with the results of a DNA Status Report filed on July 17, 2007, which concluded "none of the genetic material recovered at the scene of the crimes was attributable to Mr. Echols, Echols co-defendant, Jason Baldwin, or defendant Jessie Misskelley.


For over 14 years, The West Memphis Three have been imprisoned for crimes they didn't commit.
