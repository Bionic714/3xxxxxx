,grimboyd,2008-01-01T00:05Z,"This works, in this order ...

Close all applications

Run crack.bat

Allow restart

Only then run setup.exe

NO to check for upgrades

Thats all, it works
"
,jersson,2008-01-01T13:54Z,"I get a little confused over these two versions on how to install.

The first says run setup exe and then add crack after install

The second (Grimboyd) says start with Crack Bat before  running setup.exe.

Before I do anything, will someone tell me which one is right ?"
,st341th,2008-01-01T17:20Z,"Read the NFO. 

How on earth the previous user figured that you have to apply the crack before you install the software is beyond us."
,jersson,2008-01-01T20:40Z,"Yeah, thats what I thought too was very strange.
You cant apply the crack before you installed the software. Thanks st341h. Now I can try to download as you said."
,jersson,2008-01-01T20:48Z,"Oh I almost forgot to ask. Do I copy and paste the licence .dal file in the Diskeeper directory ?
What about the crack.exe ? what is that suppose to do ? Im a novice as you can see"
,jorgen213,2008-01-01T21:33Z,"Nope, doesnt work....just like all the other Diskeeper 2008 out there :-(

When installing i dont get the ""Click browse and select the included license.dal file""...
It just installs then the ""Untick activate diskeeper after install"" screen pops up...
Reeeeally weird!"
,darkdiver1,2008-01-01T22:47Z,"yes the license.dal didnt' work. I couldnt run the crack.bat either but it worked with the crack.exe  .Have just run the program & it works perfectly, so cheers st341th."
,st341th,2008-01-01T23:03Z,Dont mention it ;D and jorgen213 even if you dont receive those prompts the crack will still work.
,buggerlugs,2008-01-05T15:56Z,Crack wont work under vista - tab.dll cannot be deleted
,st341th,2008-01-05T17:27Z,Run as administrator.
,HeatMiseR25,2008-01-07T05:45Z,Does this work with the 64 Bit Vista?
,sindown,2008-01-08T19:54Z,"hmm, ran the program, then ran the crack.exe but it stated itw oudl not replace a dll file, but it seems to be working.  I am trying the refrag for faster boot.  whats the best options for that?
thanks
if this works, kick ass stealth!"
,sindown,2008-01-08T20:29Z,"just an update, i did the reg .exe , then the crack , restarted and working fine.  I did the boot defrag and now working on the reg defrag, seems to be working.
so works fine!"
,sindown,2008-01-08T22:12Z,"ok, third update, crack did not work.  now telling me i have 30 days to register... what did i do wrong.  step by step, please."
,st341th,2008-01-09T00:58Z,It will state you have 30 days left permanently.
,sindown,2008-01-09T04:47Z,"really, i just ran the crack.bat file, that did something and now that the should help also.
either way, i did the normal exe. then the crack.exe , finally the crack.bat, seems to be doing the job, i will check back after 30 days to see if i am still up and running."
,trix77,2008-01-11T00:52Z,please release one for x64 too =)
,joey501,2008-01-16T23:46Z,"Works 100% follow what grimboyd said
How do I make DkService.exe not run at startup?"
,st341th,2008-01-17T00:00Z,Start>Run>Services.msc>DkService>Manual
,HawkwindUK,2008-01-18T02:23Z,"grimboyd IS Correct! ...

Run crack.bat (this batch file runs crack.exe)

Allow restart Windows.

On restart, run setup.exe

Leave 2 boxes ticked on first window

When ""What do you want to do next appears, select NEVER REGISTER""

When you first run it, select CANCEL when it asks to check for upgrades.

30 days trial freezes @ 30 days!"

,biatchslapper,2008-04-27T16:57Z,"i need a 64x crack for this program and i can't find it.There was a crack on piratebay time ago but i formatted my pc and now can't find it.Could somebody upload it again, it will be great 10x"
,meh31,2008-04-28T10:59Z,"wow another great torrent i have found today, works great just follow grimboyd's and hawkwinduk's instructions..thanx"
,biatchslapper,2008-04-28T20:10Z,64bit crack.....somebody......please :((((
[T],chakra71,2008-05-08T04:03Z,"I seem to have gotten this to work with Vista Home Premium (32 bit).  The directions would fail due to a delete error code 5 on tab.dll.

If you have this problem do this:
Start -- type 'services' in the search box
find the Diskeeper service and double click it.
change the startup type to 'disabled'
reboot
run the crack.bat file and it should complete successfully.  

I can't vouch for if the crack actually cracks it, but i haven't had any trial notices or anything like that.  I'll report back if I see anything come up."
[T],chakra71,2008-05-08T04:05Z,Oh one more thing.  After the crack is finished running go back into services and change the Diskeeper service back to automatic start.  :P
,dbhome,2008-07-22T12:27Z,"http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/32597905/disk+keeper?tab=summary

here you will find the 64 bit version By Stealth"
,mjay77,2008-08-18T18:40Z,"you say ""Please note, you must deny DkService.exe access to the internet ""

that cant be done it needs to connect to a server to activate itself!!! evan after we have cracked and patched it!!!"
