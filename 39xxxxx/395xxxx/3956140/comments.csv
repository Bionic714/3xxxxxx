,jgabriel,2008-01-02T01:42Z,"Uh, dude, the Mayan calendar? NOT gonna end in 2012.

The Mayan long calendar had an infinite numbering system, just like our own.

And in 2012, it does the equivalent of going from 999 to 1000. That's it.

,Psi ink,2008-01-02T23:08Z,Thx looks very entertaining.
,transientox,2008-01-06T06:25Z,"jgabriel, you have no idea what you're talking about. The Mayan calendar could be extended arbitrarily, which means they chose 2012 for a reason.

Go do some research."
,Scorpion420,2008-01-06T18:45Z,Let me start off by saying i have been throughly looking through allthe information surrounding the mayan calnder 2012 revelation and the occult since 2001 after 911. It was clear buildings dont fall at speed like that and dissapear into nothing only explosives can do that and on abc when i was watching the news anchor said the same thing. Well This ties into literally thousands of well known stories about something climactic happening on very specifically or around dec 21 2012. Id like to point out the y2j bug for those who would like to compare had no such claim of stories throughout the world predicting y2k to end the world jsut hype. This is not hype my friends looking at all this and add in nasa has confirmed a planet coming through our solar system which could cause changes throughout our galaxy and when is it going to be closest to us? Dec 21 2012 when its at the center of the galaxy beside our sun and perturbing the gravitional field of ours. Its easy to see this means something its just hard to know exactly what that it. I wish you all to stop thinking about the past and such think of now and the immediate future it may very well be your last chance to experience life in this way.

There's are vast numbers who inwardly knows, and equally true of others who firmly disbelieve... With respect to All.. and the Best to ALL..as we are no better nor worse for our personal views...   
For those who enjoy this movie, along with 2012 Doomsday, I'm sure you'll also find other torrents on here equally as enlighting, such as Celestine Prophecy, and the Global Research torrent which will be coming forth in grand stand in 2012..Info. about this can be found by visiting the arrow2012 site.  
""Opinions""...well...there are diverse views towards these coming times, and as you might know, ""Diversity"" brings about wars, whereas, ""Unity"" brings about peace...:-} "
,lifemare,2008-07-24T09:40Z,"I consider myself the most skeptical person i know. i'm wired that way. i can't reason without pondering all sides of an issue and all the information in the world isn't enough to arrive at any conclusions, only educated guesses. As such, consubstatiation is only a matter of degree wich should not be taken any more seriously than intuition by the technocratic empiricists out there. With that in mind, i have to tell that i've found enough evidence pointing to a critical entropic event around the refered date. These come from so many different sources, all my skepticism is simply overpowered. I'll cite a few: 
- nibiru or the silent companion scorpion mentioned is a hybrid belief system shared by members of both the scientific comunity as it's esoteric nemesis"

- nibiru or the silent companion scorpion mentioned is a hybrid belief system shared by members of both the scientific comunity as it's esoteric nemesis
- the pole shift hypothesis, related to the planets mass extinctions, ice age cycle, etc. Wich is a very reputable theory, largely substantiated by magnetic analysis of geological data and believed to be much overdue.
- the information doubling paradox, a mathmatical model wich albeit, not as catastrophical as other theories, presents a very transcendent outcome for the exponential growth of information in the world (at this time data is doubling every 11 months, that scaling will be measured in seconds by 2012).
- the biodiversity deadline, wich many biologists share, although pointing to a much later period, still contributes to the overall decline of survivability.
- the mayan calendar of course, the hindu brahma, the precession of the equinox coming full circle, the beggining of aquarius, the rare planetary alignment of 2012, etc, etc, etc and many many others my memory prevents me from including, make up a fairly large and respectable list of end-of-the-world scenarios. By it's shear number and diversity of sources overshadows any and every other ""prophecy"" ever made.

That said, i wouldn't advise anyone interested in investigating further into this matter to watch this movie. Anyone looking for evidences and clues that help substantiate the mayan prophecy won't find any here. If the people interviewed in this movie are indeed intelligent researched and knowledgeable individuals that is never portrayed. It's nothing but a romanced stroll through the occult mysteries starring an inquisitive naive woman as the narrator. So my thumbs-up goes to you BrenJames, this movie is barely watchable. On the other hand i hope you don't pass on the chance to discover the truth about all this, just because it seems too far-fetched and apocalyptical at first glance. If you must disagree, please find out why you do, you owe it to yourself. Ultimately, remember it's better to believe a lie than to deny the truth."
,Milkywaycenter,2008-10-27T09:50Z,"Amazing how the ignorant fools try to discredit others opinions.  Put your heads back in the sand and when the planet of the crossing crosses once more you can be buried there for good.  Or become educated and research the truth, or see if our government will let you in to their 2 mile deep underground bunkers....I doubt that they will.  tis1234 Thank you for the torrent my enlightend brother."
,Julieakatazz,2008-12-02T15:24Z,"If this works, it's the only real new copy out there. Please seed!"
,Julieakatazz,2008-12-02T21:26Z,THIS IS NOT THE NEW MOVIE!!!
,Fugazi32,2008-12-19T22:51Z,Dodgy film.......bigging up freemasons??? They're part of the one world government agenda! The Georgia guide stone mentioning the population should not 'rise above... X amount' is part of their evil agenda to wipe us out. THIS DOCUMENTARY IS PART OF THEIR WEB! Don't waste your time...

,LJE111,2012-04-04T04:18Z,"Quality - anyone?

FYI: there is a sequel:Timewave 2013. It is excellent - so good I had to look for this one."
