,Fenix_OP,2008-06-12T03:42Z,"ahhh, I had acquired this recording off of frusciante.net (I believe..) awhile ago, I havent visited it recently however so it's kind of surprising to hear that it's not up and running still. Anyways, the computer was wiped with none of my music backed up, and I am thankful this gem is readily available here. Thank you...so...much"
