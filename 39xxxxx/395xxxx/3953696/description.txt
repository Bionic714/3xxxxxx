This is everything Initial D. The series, the movies, even the live action.

They are all in either omg or mkv format with multiple languages both spoken and subtitled. Everything but the live action movie I collected from other sources and they are mostly good quality. There are a few episodes with minor artifacts and at least twice I can recall a player crash. I just started the player back up and continued where it left off with no further problems.

The live action movie has Cantonese & Mandarin audio, and English & simplified Chinese subtitles. I tried to get the spoken English version for the subtitle impared, but for some reason it won't rip properly from the DVD. I may release a complete DVD image at some point, but have no immediate plans to do so. If I do, I'll post a link here.

For playback, I recommend either Media Player Classic or VLC Player. I use VLC Player and had no problems with playback other than the crashes mentioned above. Both programs are free and allow users to switch the audio and subtitle track to their preferance.

If there are any questions, feel free to post.

Enjoy.
