,malick14,2008-02-12T12:34Z,where can you find subtitles please?
,techiefIve,2008-05-09T09:27Z,"The subtitles are actually built into the ogg and mkv files. You simply have to select which subtitle you want to see using your media players settings.
Here are instructions for VLC player: http://www.videolan.org/doc/play-howto/en/ch03.html#id306989
And here is help with subtitles for Media Player Classic: http://forum.videohelp.com/topic284508.html"

,bjurteg,2008-09-13T15:33Z,do u use any codec pack for vlc to play mkv
,ChuckemuHaven,2008-09-27T02:05Z,"WTF kind of format is ""OGG""? It sounds like an Ogre Fart!

Where can I get a player that reads ""OGG!""??"
,MonsieurBoner,2008-11-19T20:36Z,"To everyone having trouble getting the subs and audios to work, use VLC player (free download). it's excellent! And of course, thanks to techiefIve for this excellent torrent! :)"
,MER2078,2008-11-26T22:46Z,".ogg is community based (not proprietary), winamp would probably play it. Just google whatever you don't understand... .ogg-->hit ""search"" and vuala!! instant knowledge! :)

,knoxbox,2008-12-01T07:40Z,"i just wish there was english audio for all the files, but i've searched and there is only english dub on first stage and second stage, however in this torrent there is only english dub on the first stage and the rest are all english subs which is okay i guess. 

i just don't understand why we can't get anime over here any faster in full english versions i'm half tempted to learn japanese just so i can understand."
,gamer901122,2008-12-13T19:06Z,please seed

,ihatefall,2009-07-04T23:16Z,"Its not all in English because it was never DUBBed that way. The English version sucks anyway. Just learn Japanese isn't not that hard, I learned in it about 3-4 years. I taught in Japanese, I have been on Japanese tv and everything. 
Look up the the genki series books, look remembering the kanji by heisig and then go and live in Japan for bit or travel there. Hop on Mixi.jp and look for Japanese peeps in your area. Study for the JLPT 4 right off the get go. 
But I will warn you Japan is not the ""anime lover's geek's dream"" that you think. the Average j-person is allllllll about fashion and thinking anime is dumb. seriously, I lived there and my gf is japanese. "
,ivy26,2009-08-06T08:47Z,please seed I'm stuck at 65%. did somebody complete downloading this? please thank you~
,tsumeclaw,2009-08-16T06:15Z,"Two questions:

1. Is this the ORIGINAL Initial-D, with the good music, or the American-distribution version with the cRAP music?

2. Are ALL of the episodes in this torrent available as ORIGINAL, Japanese audio, with English subtitles, and not locked into English dubs only?

Thanks."
,AnonymousTrotskyist,2010-02-25T05:04Z,"Fuck learning the moonspeak. The subs are just fine with me.

Great torrent for including both languages and subs"
,da-pink-blub,2010-03-02T05:48Z,great quality on some of time... but needs more SEEDER!!!... i am doing my share when ever i can :P 
,HidetoTakarai99X,2010-03-03T18:35Z,"LAME. The only thing I wanted was the First Stage in Japanese and all I get here is the stupid English dub (which is alright, but not what I was looking for). The movie is in full Japanese with no subs, so there's no point trying to understand it."
,rhrgbmx,2010-04-04T10:02Z,Does anybody know if it is possible to get stage 3 with English audio? I am asking for a friend because he cant find it. any help would be much appreciated

1st stage, the aspect ratio has been stretched from the original!
3rd stage is pixelated.
2nd stage is fine
4th stage is the le-ide versoin, so it should be good, right? NO! this version has visual errors."
