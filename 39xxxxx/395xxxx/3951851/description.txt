Came home this week to find a message for me, it was thanking me for the download of 
70.09.19 MSG, NY - 'American Woman'.

Spoke to the guy and said he wanted to hear how it sounded compared to his version.
He said he taped the show himself back in 70. He asked me if I wanted to download his version.
I did,  and here it is, many thanks for the download.

I have not heard a version of this show ( or seen any setlist ) that contain the last 3 songs listed above.

The sound on this show is far better than the 'American Woman' version.

It was the last show of that US tour 70.09.19 and you can hear plant saying to the audience that something sad
happened yesterday,  Hendrix died.   I checked, he died on 18th Sept 70,  the day before this show.

Hope you enjoy this show as much as I do.
