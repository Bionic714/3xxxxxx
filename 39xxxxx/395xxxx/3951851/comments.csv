i don't worship the guy, but seeing inferior versions spread around is a real problem with zep torrenters."
,TimD54,2008-01-29T10:14Z,"And some people like downloading shows that are totally unaltered.  This happens to be the original torrent that hit the net the night the show was dropped the first time.  I, for your information, helped identify this show.  I know more about this show than you can possibly imagine.  And this show is the raw transfer, not a juiced-up re-EQed Presence Blue Light Special.  People who want real low-gens know where to look.  Some of us can do our own EQs.  

Look, I've been doing this for a long time.  If you want to see how a class production is run, sit back and shut the fuck up.  If you want to continue to make an ass of yourself, please return your oral cavity to Presence's phallic server and allow me to torrent the photos.

In short, fuck off.

i see your gonna torrent southhampton, a show PRESENCE liberated.  gee, i bet there will be a complete absence of credit."
,TimD54,2008-02-02T05:10Z,Good for Jason.  I don't have to give him credit.  He has you to hold his cock for him.  You told me something about you just now.  Thank you.
,staern,2008-05-03T22:27Z,The last hour of this show may just be the finest hour in rock history!
