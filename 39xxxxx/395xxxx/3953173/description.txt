Just in Time compilers - breaking a VM

Practical VM exploiting based on CACAO

We will present state of the art JIT compiler design based on CACAO, a GPL licensed multiplatform Java VM. After explaining the basics of code generation, we will focus on "problematic" instructions, and point to possible ways to exploit stuff.

A short introduction into just-in-time compiler techniques is given: Why JIT, about compiler invocation, runtime code modification using signals, codegeneration. Then theoretical attack vectors are elaborated: language bugs, intermediate representation quirks and assembler instruction inadequacies. With these considerations in mind the results of a CACAO code review are presented. For each vulnerability possible exploits are discussed and two realized exploits are demonstrated.
