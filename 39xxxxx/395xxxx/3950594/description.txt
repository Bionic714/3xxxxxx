Coming out a mere six years after her debut single, Velvet-Covered Brick is
(hopefully) the final version of Robin English's debut album. Released after 
torturous process that included getting bounced by a major label's Nashville
division because said debut single was lost in a corporate downsizing and the
aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, plus an earlier version of the album that was
released on Koch Entertainment's country imprint Aspirion as Robin English in
2006 with different cover art, some different mixes, and a couple of minor so
("Hello Me" and "I'm Yours") that were left off this version. So finally, goi
the self-release and indie distribution route, Robin English finally has her
debut album out. And it's...OK. English, who co-produced the album and wrote 
co-wrote every song, is a pretty decent country songwriter with an eye for
textural detail; "Baby You're the Man" and several other songs make direct
reference to her east Texas roots in a fashion sure to please other Lone Star
staters. She also has a better than average voice, with a particularly
impressive low register, as she shows on the bluesy gospel tune "Mission of
Mercy" and the sultry purr of "Wake Up Loving You." But those appealing eleme
are set against some fairly average tunes given a generally disinterested
Nashville-style radio-ready gloss that tends to overpower the more unique,
personal traits of English's lyrics and vocals. Put in a more stripped-down,
live sounding setting (maybe even an actual live album!), Robin English and h
songs would come across much better than they do here. Perhaps having finally
gotten this project completed to her liking, she can move forward from here.
