Any chans that DS9 is on the way? :)"
,V4Friend,2008-01-24T17:22Z,"Kal-hygge: the DVD's of DS9 are all already on The Pirate Bay ;-) Search and you will find!

A question for all you fellow Trekfans: does anyone have Disc 6 from season 6 of Star Trek Deep Space 9?

The torrent that is present on the Pirate Bay is dead (it's stuck at 98% and has been for 3 weeks :-(

We (30 of us) would appreciate it very much if anyone would reseed or re-upload this DVD (if possible: the DVD content i.e. VIDEO_TS folder).

Thanks in advance!"
[T],wormman,2008-01-25T01:42Z, V4friend  I will help you seed. 
,V4Friend,2008-01-25T07:42Z,"Wow, wormman!

That's really great: thanks! And of course also many thanks for uploading Enterprise :-)

B.t.w. are you also reading the seed-requests in the forum? It's a great way to communicate ;-)"
,V4Friend,2008-01-27T09:56Z,"Hello wormman,

Sorry, but I have another request. Some 20 are stuck on this one: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3504263/Star_Trek_-_DS9_S2D3
The files on my DVD are different, so I cannot help them myself. Maybe you can?"
,raider56,2008-02-18T17:07Z,"First: Thanks a lot to wormman for his great uploads! Then @ V4Friend. Yes every trekker on TPB know about DS9 uploaded by peteralf, bender-c. Mauser23 and a bunch of other the last years. But we also know they only have 67% of there original quality remaining after shrink. I have dl some of them but they looked like crap on my 42 inch screen and even worse on projector screen, so I look for DVD9 too."
,Bam73,2009-09-07T15:53Z,"Jag sällar mig till TACK-sägarna!

Underbart att få se avsnitten. 
Är för tillfället Arbetssökande å ett avsnitt STAR TREK får en alttid på bätter humör.

TUSEN TACK!"
,vossejongk,2009-11-18T21:11Z,"Thanks so much! I've always wanted to see the complete series. Never got to watch all of the episodes on TV, and buying all the seasons for 80 euro is insane."
,nwg,2009-11-26T10:31Z,Thanks for the upload Wormman.
,wynnbeez,2010-11-01T22:03Z,Are these files .AVI format or ISO. I use Utorrent as my download program and have Power ISO program. But I do not know how to use he ISO files and to download them to either save or burn to DVD. If my files are .AVI files I just keep them all on an external 1TB hard drive and watch them using Windows Media Player. Can someone help me????? I am a novice to torrents.
