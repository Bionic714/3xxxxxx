Everything has worked well except step 7 and 8.
I have located the folder but I don't know how to perform ""copy the crack from the folder into TSBIN overwirte the origonal sims2.exe"" !
Help would be very much appreciated.
(The game asks for a cd when I try to run it but I assume it has to do with that I haven't completed step 7) ! If anyone wants to mail me my hotmail is thepenguin6_6@hotmail.com"
