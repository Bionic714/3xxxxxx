What aboutj the *.daa? I'm not very good at this, and I haven't even downloaded it yet, but something tells me that ""tribunal.daa"" and ""bloodmoon.daa"" have something to do with Tribunal and Bloodmoon."
,Meeps,2008-12-01T07:25Z,Great game but the game says allways when i try to play it please insert the disc and i have run the no-cd patch.
,helltrooper,2010-03-02T02:12Z,Hey i found out how to install the expansions just open the DAA files with PowerISO drag the files to any folder and install it after you got the original working. Thanks for the torrent got everything to work good

,Seunkreoo,2010-09-06T22:10Z,"for anyone who don't [have]/[want to install] PowerIso, there is a way to convert .daa files into .iso files:"
