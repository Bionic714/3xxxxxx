,xxdaxx,2008-01-14T18:36Z,great download...thanks
,forsaken44,2008-01-31T01:28Z,"Would you be so kind as to remove this torrent? 

Simone isn't some big star. And yet you are still uploading her songs by the thousands. At least support her by buying the album if you like it."
,cupiddstunt,2008-02-07T12:17Z,"Forsaken44 I fullly understand what you are getting at but one way of becoming bigger is to be heard by more people and this gets her heard by more people.  

Then if they like it they will know who she is when she concerts nera to them and will go and pay to hear her and she grows as an artist.

Would you go to a stones concert if you had never heard of them before??

,PPKLP,2008-02-25T15:25Z,"I totally agree with cupiddstunt.. I don't get ppl like ""forsaken44"", they register on torrentsite, download free music, and then complain about copyrights?!? 

I always listen to an album before I buy it or buy tickets to their shows. A lot of young/new artists sell more albums and concert tickets thanx too sites like this... It's only the 'Rich and Greedy' like Metallica how don't need to sell more albums that are complaining about illegal downloading. 

But obviously, if Simone White would ask it here self, I would remove the torrent off course... But till then... 

Let's help here out and listen to her music.. 

Oh and thanx for the upload, technobeats..."
,monkey20052005,2008-03-02T00:55Z,"yes forsaken44, kiss my wrinkly old arse, its like mary whitehouse being on a porn site complaining, if you dont like it fuck off and go and tell those pesky kids to play soccer up there own end, might give you more pleasure if you like pissing moaning...........you old fart...oh and great album by the way, i"
,Eddie_Plum,2009-01-17T14:38Z,"To be fair, I appreciate what forsaken44 was getting at.  The bigger artists can withstand the hit of losing out on a few CDs, but the smaller ones struggle a lot more.  Fair comment, but it is true that sites like TPB help to spread the music and get it heard by more people, thus helping to boost later sales.
Just my two pence worth!
Ed."
,MattCurlew,2009-12-30T03:08Z,forsaken44 has a point but other too. Too bad monkey20052005 had to be rude.. ps: great download! She's great!
,Dimking,2010-06-05T22:15Z,"Accidentally saw the R8 Ad and heard that marvellous voice. 
Guys, pls seed. Tnx for upload."
,rtfarty,2010-10-01T12:05Z,Fely I had to add my bit here...over the years I have spent a fortune on albums I had heard one good trck off from the radio only to be disappointed...those days are over now and I pick and choose what to buy more carefully and wisely. It is a sign of progress and sign of the times..artists have to be aware that weaker albums won't sell...
,Dimking,2011-04-27T20:37Z,We want more! have any? :)
