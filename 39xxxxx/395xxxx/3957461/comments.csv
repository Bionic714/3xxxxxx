,ladysith13,2008-10-19T16:09Z,This is a wonderful vid! Great for new vegans and also some nice ideas and refresh course for more seasoned vegans!
,sonofwill,2009-03-19T09:06Z,"   Being vegan just makes your body WORK better! So many of ""the usual ailments"" magically vanish after adopting a vegan lifestyle. 
   Just curious, does this video go in depth with various recipes? Or is it mostly focused on the ""whys"" regarding vegan diets, listing all the (and there is lots of it) scientific literature backing up the health benefits?"
,searchsnit,2009-06-16T02:14Z,Great video for anyone that wants to be healthy and have less of a negative impact on the planet. Eating healthy is really not that hard and makes such a HUGE difference.
