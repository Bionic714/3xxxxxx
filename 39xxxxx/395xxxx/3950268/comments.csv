,captainjeff,2007-12-27T22:53Z,Does this have the blur on the bottom like the other copy floating around?
,Art_Vendelay,2007-12-28T00:04Z,"wow how many people can possibly up the same 1.3 gb version, fucking lame"
,professorfuntime,2007-12-28T02:40Z,The version I watched had two blurry lines on the bottom and had no musical accompaniment. Weird to see a movie with no sound track other then the voices and such.
,gylgamesh5,2007-12-28T04:22Z,"That's the way the movie was produced, professorfuntime, the film has no soundtrack."
,professorfuntime,2007-12-28T05:51Z,"^ Interesting, not very common I must say. Very noticeable."
