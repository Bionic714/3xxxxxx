,Angelily,2008-04-09T12:23Z,"Hello Everybody,
  I think that the seeder you are all downloading from is me, and if that's the case then no one will ever get beyond 20.5 because that's what it's been stuck at for me since I added it on March 11th. Sorry guys.

Dear pirate4,
  this torrent was going really quickly and then just died, which makes me think that you stopped uploading a while ago (perhaps because there seemed to be a lot of seeders), however none of us has the complete torrent and we all seem to have the same pieces. Please, please reseed this torrent and I promise to let you know as soon as I'm done downloading and then I'll seed it myself. This is a really exciting collection that should be shared. Thanks a bunch!"
