,DonQuiggifur,2008-01-05T23:51Z,"Happy New Year to you as well; This is Fable, the Lost Chapters, I believe (I'm guessing it's not the first, but I've been wrong before).  I don't know much about it, other than I was at my friend's house, he had it, and I burned it.  Haven't played it much, but it seems to work on my system.  Wish I could help more...  As well, and before anyone complains, I'm a commercial driver and can't be on while I'm driving.  I do however seed when I'm stopped."

,emeloo2,2008-10-19T18:53Z,"The Lost Chapters features all the content found in the original Fable, as well as additional new content such as new monsters, weapons, alignment based spells, items, armor, towns, buildings, and expressions, as well as the ability to give children objects. The story receives further augmentation in the form of nine new areas and sixteen additional quests. Characters such as Briar Rose and Scythe, who played only minor roles in the original game, are now given more importance and are included in certain main and side quests. Other character-based augmentations include the antagonist, Jack of Blades' voice sounding deeper, harsher and more demonic; or being able to uncover (and resolve) the murder mystery behind Lady Grey's sister.

If this is TLC , it is = NOT = The First Fable."
,blargarg,2009-03-16T05:52Z,"Anyone mind seeding this?  Only showing 5, want to get it going so i can leave the seed going on my laptop 24/7 :p  Dedicated TPB machine for the win!"
,natchos,2009-06-01T21:37Z,"The download was really great thanks alot. Had a little problem with serial key but quickly solved it. Now however when i try to install at about the middle it comes up and error message saying""
Error 1308.Source file not found: E:\ Fable - The Lost Chapters\data\Video\3_theresa_flashback_comp.wmw. Verify that the file exists and that you can access it.""
and it gives me three choices 
1. Abort
2. Try again
3. Ignore
I have found the file manually and it works. So yes the file is there and ""accessible"" so it aint that. I tried option 2 a few times, just instantly runs into the same prob again. Do you think i could take Ignore install and then use repair tool? Or perhaps embed the file manually once the install itself is done? Please give me some feedback as of what to do as I am at somewhat of a loss here."
,shiny11100,2009-08-08T20:07Z,"hey natchos and anyone else who has this problem...

,Charmion,2010-08-08T01:17Z,"Very fast download, simple to install. For all those having trouble, I cannot see why you are because when you take game torrents in general into consideration, it's actually one of the simplest I've some across. I use Windows 7, so the details may vary, but it's literally this easy:

Download and install PowerISO here: http://www.poweriso.com/download.htm

In the Fable file you have just downloaded, there are 4 .NRG files. Right-click the first, Fable (1o4), select ""Open with,"" select ""Choose default program..."" and choose PowerISO from the directory into which you have installed it. This should bring up a separate PowerISO window in which you may view the files in Fable (1o4). Just exit the window.

Now, right-click the first NRG file again and there should now be an option (if there was not before) with an arrow beside it called ""PowerISO."" Hover the cursor over this to bring up a side menu, and select the third option on that menu, ""Extract here using file names for folders."" The PowerISO viewer should come up again. Answer in the affirmative to any questions it may ask. Wait for extraction. Exit PowerISO window again.

A file should now come up that shares the same title as the first NRG file, but is a folder. Now, right click the second NRG file and again choose PowerISO > Extract here using file names for folders. Do this again for the third and fourth NRG files.

Now, go into the ""Fable (1o4)"" FOLDER, find an application called ""setup.exe"" and open.

It asks for a CD key. I used this successfully: PXXQW 4PPBR KBD3F X33C3 YC34M. If not , try these: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080505133048AAGDvuY

Install."

One problem though when installing after it gets about a quarter fo the way through I get an error message saying Error1311.Source file not found:
Veryify that the file exists and that you can access it.

Ive tried mounting the game, and other stuff but I keep getting the same problem, what do I do?"
,Elkah,2011-06-13T06:05Z,"Just a note I left out in my last post: Error1311.Source file not found: D:\Initial D\Fable\Disk 1\Disk1C~1
Veryify that the file exists and that you can access it."
,Elkah,2011-06-13T07:47Z,"Awk, I got it installed etc but now when I try to launch it it comes up with ""Windows can not find 'Splash.exe'. Make sure you typed the name correctly and then try again.""

After clicking ""ok"" It comes up with ""ERROR: Could not find library."" whats all this mean? Did I mount the wrong file?

please email me with any help mitty3012@hotmail.com"
