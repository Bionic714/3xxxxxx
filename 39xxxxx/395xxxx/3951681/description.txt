Superunknown is the fourth album by the Seattle grunge band Soundgarden. It was released in March 1994 through A&M Records. The songs on the album are more experimental and diverse than the band's previous recordings, with some songs having a Middle-Eastern or Indian flavor (for example "Half"). Some songs also show a Beatles influence, such as "Black Hole Sun" and "Head Down". In a 1994 interview with Guitar World, guitarist Kim Thayil explains this: "We looked deep down inside the very core of our souls and there was a little Ringo sitting there. Oh sure, we like telling people it's John Lennon or George Harrison; but when you really look deep inside of Soundgarden, there's a little Ringo wanting to get out." Soundgarden utilized alternative tunings and odd time signatures on several of the album\\\'s songs. "Spoonman" and "Black Hole Sun" were performed in drop D tuning. Some songs used more unorthodox tunings: \\\"My Wave\\\" and \\\"The Day I Tried to Live\\\" are both in a E-E-B-B-B-E tuning. Soundgarden\\\'s use of odd-meter time signatures was varied as well; \\\"My Wave\\\" uses 5/4, \\\"Fell on Black Days\\\" is on 6/4, and \\\"Spoonman\\\" is rare for its unusual mix of 4/4 and 7/4 time signatures. Kim Thayil has said the band usually did not consider the time signature of a song until after they had written it, and said that the use of odd meters was \\\"a total accident.\\\" The song \\\"Spoonman\\\" is notable for featuring a performance by Artis the Spoonman, a street entertainer in Seattle. The title of the song is credited to Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam. While on the set of the movie Singles, Jeff produced a list of song titles for the fictional band featured in the movie. Chris Cornell took it as a challenge to write a list of songs using those titles, and \\\"Spoonman\\\" was one of them. A demo version of the song appears in the movie. Lyrically, the album is quite dark and mysterious, as much of it is often interpreted to be dealing with issues such as substance abuse, suicide, and depression. The song \\\"Flutter Girl\\\" was written during the recording sessions but did not appear on the record. Instead, it eventually appeared on a promo called \\\'Poncier\\\' and later a much different version on Chris Cornell\\\'s solo album, Euphoria Morning. In 1995 it was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, and picked up two Grammys for the songs \\\"Black Hole Sun\\\" and \\\"Spoonman\\\". The album went 5x platinum, had five charting singles, and granted Soundgarden huge international recognition. In 2003, the album was ranked number 336 on Rolling Stne magazine\\\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Six singles were released from the album; these singles were \\\"Spoonman\\\", \\\"The Day I Tried to Live\\\", \\\"Black Hole Sun\\\", \\\"My Wave\\\", \\\"Fell on Black Days\\\", and the title track as an EP. The \\\"Black Hole Sun\\\" single was released shortly after the death of grunge icon Kurt Cobain in 1994. It is arguably the band\\\'s most recognizable and popular song. Its surreal music video received heavy airplay on music television and, in 1995, received the Clio Award for Alternative Music Video. The songs \\\"Kickstand\\\" and \\\"Superunknown\\\" were featured in the PC and Sega Saturn versions of the Electronic Arts game, Road Rash.
