,LPsoldier88,2008-01-01T05:52Z,"this works. i tried it and all you have to do is delete that file they say to erase so we cant get pirated message. 
as for how to unzip it, just unzip the embrace zip all 36 of them. and its file and the keymaker."
,Sibenosys,2008-01-01T15:07Z,"I did everything by the instructions including the file delete.
Even installed offline and deleted the file before getting  online again.

Still, after a day or 2 of use, starts showing randomly the dialog that says is not legit.
And gets more frequent as time goes by..."

Defenatly it's not yet completely cracked."
