I was wondering if someone can put together a Naruto XXX siterip collection. There are a couple of free sites, that I would love the rips from. (I cant get to them because of the firewall that runs my building's internet... :)

(if you do, then please no pixelized images, etc.. - sorry for being picky, but those SUCK!) 

--- Thanks again!"
