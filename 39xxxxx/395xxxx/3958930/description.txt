The Imperial Swordsman
Celestial Remastered Shaw Brothers Classic
****DVDrip to DIVX Ultra Insane Quality 2 pass, included .srt english subs plus divx ultra format embedded subtitles in chinese and english (to view things such as subtitles and multiple audio languages, or to use the chapter changing features, use divx.com free divx ultra player). The cool thing about ripping a dvd into divx ultra with divx author 1.5, you can keep the chapter markers that are on the original dvd. Which is why I highly recommend you use a divx compatible standalone dvd player or divx ultra player software to view this file so you can take advantage of the built in english and chinese subtitles, plus you can change chapters just like the dvd. This movie doesn't have multiple audio tracks like some of my past releases, this one's dvd only offers the file in Mandarin. ENJOY and comments are welcome! Please start uploading your own shaw brothers collection to help the communitiy!****
