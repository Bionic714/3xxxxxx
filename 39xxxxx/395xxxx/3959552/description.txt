Notes:

Wash It All Off,
Sick Minutes,
Halo Flamin' Lead
Finely Honed Machine,
Today I Started Slogging Again,
are actually taken from the bonus 12" with 'Hole' LP 1984.

The FOETUS OVER FRISCO - Custom Built For Capitalism 12" is missing here as I don't have a lossless source myself.

These recordings are long out of print.
None of this was ever released on CD.
Enjoy it!
