People just don't seem to fuck around when they are torrenting older movies, which is really nice.

On the other hand, those torrents seldom get the credit they deserve.. so a big thank you to the uploader!"
,burken81,2008-01-21T21:03Z,I've seen the whole movie now and everything worked perfectly. Thank you so much for uploading the movie. great seeding...only took a little more than an hour to download. Thanks so much...I will seed now!!!

,m2dai2dak2dae,2008-11-17T15:01Z,"I just started downloading this and I trust it will be cone soon. Thanks to all the seeders! 
If you're into it... Play this movie with the sound off and put Pink Floyd's album ""Meddle"" on. Start it just after the movie's overture. 
I haven't done it yet, but I've heard its pretty neat :)"
,mr.poop,2009-02-02T11:21Z,Thank you!! Very good quality!!
,pilatuspilot,2009-02-21T20:38Z,"Someone asked for the movie ""Scarlett"", sort of like a 'GWTW-The Sequel'.
It was a (USA-TV) mini-series in 1994. It wasn't very well done, because, no doubt, anyone who cared about the tale saw it is a conitnuation of GWTW but without the cast and crew of the original.
I haven't heard of anyone bothering to duplicate that mess."
,4Flushed,2009-04-11T00:56Z,Can we get some seeders.....  lot's of us stuck at 79%

For those of you looking for scarlett- don't waste your time. The movie is a Joke and was never ever part of the original story by Margarit Mitchell."
