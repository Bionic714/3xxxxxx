,ptheoch,2008-01-01T11:39Z,DVDRips! It took me some days ripping my collection but it's worth it!
,Mentat_Abbas,2008-01-01T16:50Z,This torrent would be a lot more popular if it included English or French subtitles as well.
,ptheoch,2008-01-01T19:22Z,"I'm Greek, besides Greek subtitles are hard to find, not English or French"
,ptheoch,2008-01-02T22:26Z,Please SEED! I can't do it by myself..
,aenoae,2008-01-14T18:09Z,thnx!
,sonicalchemy,2008-01-30T07:43Z,"Can you please rip the engish subs for your collection? are there English subs included?or only Greek? I'm shure if you can add a link to the Eng subs this torrent will NEVER die.

Thanx so much

,ptheoch,2008-01-31T00:52Z,"I'm afraid me DVD collection includes only Greel subtitles..

Here is the link from opensubtitles.com.

I believe you can make a correspondance between English and Polish with the help of imdb.com.

I'm sorry i can't help more.."

,raheesen,2008-09-30T11:25Z,excellent quality...great movie(series)...very very thanks.
,jgabriel,2008-11-16T02:35Z,"IMPORTANT!

FYI: The version of Decalog 1 in this torrent is short by about 6-8 minutes. For the complete episode, try this torrent instead: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3411505/Krzysztof_Kieslowski__Dekalog_1_(Xvid)_[CiN]

As far as I know, only episode 1 is cut. The rest appear to be the proper length. Perhaps it was a version cut for commercial TV, since the rest of the episodes are all in the 55-60 minute range.

,dingo_oink,2008-12-18T16:53Z,"Awesome ...  and in great quality.
Much appreciated."
,thuerrsch,2009-01-14T16:01Z,"Superb quality, thanks a lot! The English subs recommended by Distanasia are fine, too.

The first of the films is indeed a little shorter than the rest, so I replaced it with the longer version from jgabriel's link.

For anybody who wants to know, here's a list of the original Polish titles in numerical order:

Dekalog, jeden
Dekalog, dwa
Dekalog, trzy
Dekalog, cztery
Dekalog, pi??
Dekalog, sze??
Dekalog, siedem
Dekalog, osiem
Dekalog, dziewi??
Dekalog, dziesi??
