,DualX,2008-04-22T14:18Z,"Pretty good quality of the files, many seeders good speeds. altought that the first episode was a we big =\"
,dijitali,2008-04-29T17:27Z,"Having same problem as sigurdnw with episode 5.
VLC player finds it corrupt, and it freezes about 6:30 mins in.  Repairing AVI index takes ages, so I'll probably go to another torrent.

Other than that great torrent, all other files working great.  Perfect quality and a speedy download."
,retrocow,2008-05-05T21:36Z,Episode 5 is corrupt here too.
,tomank101,2008-05-21T17:38Z,"Awesome upload! Had fantastic DL speeds, THANKS SEEDERS. Also, the episodes are fantastic quality, only had a problem with episode 5, didn't work at all but still, could stream it off the internet. I live in England, and heroes only being on episode 6 at the moment I can show off to all my friends!
Thanks!"
