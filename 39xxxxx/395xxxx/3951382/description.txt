XPlite - we give YOU the power to set up YOUR machine the way YOU want!



With XPlite and 2000lite we give YOU the power to set up YOUR machine the way YOU want! The power to remove unwanted features, the power to remove upgrades that go bad, the power to strip potential security and privacy threats out by the roots.



More than a powerful configuration utility - XPlite and 2000lite give you amazing control to repair Windows as well. If a particular technology gives you trouble you can completely remove it, and then reinstall it as cleanly as the day Windows was first installed on your computer



XPlite/2000lite is a tool that helps you to setup your PC.









The ultimate security system? There can be little argument that certain Microsoft technologies have proven themselves to put your privacy, security and system stability at risk.

The sheer number of Windows Update security fixes that are released on an almost daily basis testify to this fact.



You can choose alternate technologies to avoid the security risks, yet the flawed components remain on your system unused, until the next irresponsible hacker or malicious script takes advantage of the situation.

Everybody should be running with the latest patches and Service Packs - but is this enough?

XPlite and 2000lite allow you to completely remove features that might put you at risk.



For example - many email viruses use Outlook Express and the Windows Address Book to invade your privacy and that of your friends whose addresses you have stored. If you choose to use an alternate email system then XPlite and 2000lite allow you to totally remove Outlook Express and the Windows Address Book from your system.



Now you know you are protected!
