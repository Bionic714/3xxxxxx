DVD 6 only contains ""The Story so Far"", a 40 min. recap of S2&3; thus no new material if you have already seen those.
So unless I hear a strong demand, I wont be uploading it."
,Kaspar4283,2007-12-30T02:33Z,"I of course meant ""recap of S1&2""."
[T],paulyearwig,2007-12-30T09:16Z,"you're a star, thank you"
,fukvista,2007-12-30T10:16Z,"Please upload disc 6
It has been so long since I've seen season 1&2 it would be great to have a recap.

Thanks 10x Kaspar4283 for discs 1-5"
,DorkTower,2007-12-30T13:14Z,"THX for the DVD's!!!!!
I thought the 6th would also contain the Webisodes?  
If it would be nice if you put that on also online."

,rimmerbsc,2008-01-05T18:50Z,"okay upload, but it seams that part of the last episode of each disk is missing, bit of a batch really"
,s20dan,2008-01-14T18:04Z,"@ DorkTower.  The Webisodes are already on the piratebay, find them on this torrent, just choose the files u want.
