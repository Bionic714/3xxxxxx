I already downloaded Matlab2007b but without a keygen.   Do you think you could post a few serials, or better yet, make a torrent with just the keygen? 
I would really appreciate either. 
Thanks!"
,lostitall12828,2008-01-15T15:20Z,"Matlab 2007b Full Release (keygen).rar

File infected with the ""W32/NewUnknownMalware-OC05!Maximus"" virus and could not be disinfected."
,monkpunchy,2008-01-18T04:12Z,does anybody know how to get the java builder expansion?
,Tethys,2008-01-24T19:32Z,"About infection:

I've tried several antivirus programs and antispyware. Some of them do really say that the file is infected, and put it to isolator.
I just ignored it or turned off the antivirus for the time I generate the key.
I have a Symantec Corporate edition installed at office and it says almost about every keygen for many programs I've installed that they are infected.
But that's not true.
That could be beacuse the antivirus considers the file has spyware or any threat to computers security, but that is not a virus!!!
Actually all keygens are spyware and a threat for security, because they are made for piracy!!!
So, finally it is up for you to decide to use any keygen or not."

Here is the link for separate keygen. As asked."

Try searching MATLAB Builder for Java in google.
There are plenty links.
