feel free to comment"

,amath666,2008-07-01T21:50Z,I'm downloading this right now. Perhaps it would work better if you seeded it. I can't wait to try it out.
,jo.killers,2008-11-23T03:19Z,pls seed im stucked at 99.7%... thx
,Ratzzz,2008-11-30T21:08Z,"I downloaded, unzipped and installed the games.
It seems that I canÂ´t play Heretic or Hexen with sound and music... only with music or it will lag me to death.

Is there a way to play the games with fully working sound and music?

I can't play Heretic 2 for some reason... if I try and play it it says that I need a cd and if I use the no-cd crack it just won't start.

Hexen II works fine but it's a bit laggy."

,dreaming82,2009-07-25T14:46Z,"these arent original rips; the hexen 2 iso has no music tracks. cant tell the rest.
