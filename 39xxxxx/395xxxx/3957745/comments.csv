Either grab Blindwrite (the software used to rip the disc) and burn a dupe copy.  Their website is: http://www.blindwrite.com/

Or you can simply use Daemon Tools v4.06+.   Choose ""mount image"" and navigate to the castaway.B6T file.  It will recognize that as an image file and mount it.  Then burn/copy/rip/whatever it."
