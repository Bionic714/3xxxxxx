BTW, I have not had a lot of free time yet to read up on all this app does and was curious if there is a master reset to totally reset everything without having to uninstall and install it over again?

    Also, if you guys like this program there is a totally free program from Google you should love for your pics, once you get the fell for it and use the folder manager in tools you will see what I mean.  The name of the app is Picasa2, totally free and a very kick ass program.  Got to run guys, take care & I didn't mean to bitch but I was having one of those days.  L8rz.........."

,Slave-Pig,2008-02-21T15:24Z,"     Try this link, it is the one that Gobbler3666 sent, it works fine.  When you try to run the *.exe it might ask for a certain *.dll file & say it isn't in the dir.  Don't worry just do a search on your < C > drive for the *.dll it wants, you will see it and then copy and paste it into the directory and have fun :)

     That reminds me, hey Sydney0668 or Zenny14940, either one of you can suck my dick if you want to.  I am not sure but I think I have fallen for the both of you.

tho im still getting popup errors on boot now so im wondering if i should just reformat anyway..

do you think id be able to go back to using 9.0.0.9 after a reinstall of XP? or do you think that would still not work (it worked up till today.. even after updated versions didnt work and i would reinstall 9.0.0.9) or did they do something thats gonna block me from using that version again"
,diamond-optic,2008-02-24T04:54Z,anyone having trouble with the portable version not saving all the settings? like mainly the colors (for unselected/selected files folders and such..) it keeps reseting to default right in the middle of using it

ive got a new HD coming via UPS today that im gonna dual boot xp and vista on so i'll be reinstalling anyway.. 

and i used 9.0.0.9 for like a year and never had any trouble with it.. plus i like how that can have full integration and windows explorer replacement when the portable one the options are grayed out on the integration option page

and with uninstalling.. i did go thru all the registry searching for dopus and gpsoft and such and removed everything but it didnt seem to make a difference for me"
,nok32,2008-02-27T07:04Z,"ahh this comment thread.. so nice to see people working together.
thx for the u/l, i got the portable version, havent tried it yet.
for the 'explorer replacement' option, i bet the reg patch i posted for xplorer2 would also work for dopus if you change a few things.
xplorer2 is a bit buggy at times and slower than dopus to start, but i am coping. still recommend it, since dopus still seems pretty to cause issues. i guess it testifies to the skill of their coders, since they have stumped us all for this long! heh."
,Slave-Pig,2008-02-27T10:22Z,"	Hey guys, this might be stupid but just a thought.  Until they come up with tight 9 the 8 is working great for me, no problems at all with it.
	Second thing is this, take a copy of Norton ghost 2003 and make up a restore disk.  Then take and use Nero and burn an emulated bootable floppy onto your CD and copy the floppy disk files to the bootable CD.  Finally once you get your system and programs exactly the way you want to make a backup of your primary partition onto a backup partition.  Then proceed to install opus 9 and if the fucker fails just call your old image file with all you perfectly installed software and there will be zero trace of 9 and best of all it only takes about 3 minutes to recover everything.  Just a thought, it is what I do when I am going to test out new shit that I am not sure of.  When I used to program, especially fucking around with API, formating was second nature and the above method turned hours of work into minutes and there is no chance in hell of any trace of version 9 hiding shit when it was not included in the partition backup.  Make sure though you do your format and shit and setup everything but 9 before you make your ghost image using that CD and then use that same CD to restore if and when 9 fails."
,nok32,2008-02-28T01:36Z,"i got the usb version of dopus to replace explorer!
1) open the apply.txt and make sure the path is the same as yours. i made it C:\Program Files\dopus\dopus.exe you can either change it to the path you want to use (make sure you replace all instances), or move the dopus folder to match the one above.
2) once you get that sorted, change the file extension of apply.txt to .reg
3) double-click and add to the regsitry.
4) try clicking on 'my computer' or whatever other folder. BOOOO-YAAAHHH!!!! :)

BUT! I got a JV16 Powertools torrent and CCleaner and ran them both twice when I was in safe mode with its registry finder / cleaner things and it found 9 different files when I searched for any instance of ""opus"". Each time I ran each one it would find more...

I restarted my computer out of safe mode to attempt what will be my last attempt to get this program to work.

During the install it wanted me to paste libeay32.dll into that folder, so I did and then it successfully didn't recognize any of the last 4 times I've tried to re-install it. 

Using the host-file trick and deleting the folder I used to install it really helped.

I also realized that I didn't know where I put my key for the 9.0 version so I just found the one from when I attempted to use the 9.9.0.0.9 license and it's the first time it's ever not continued that countdown to how many days I had left... today would have been my last day."

Thanks again!"
,jarno_nekdes,2008-06-06T12:32Z,"i meant a program error (in ""dopus_main"" if that matters)

And the way i got it to work was by just using another serial provided by the keygen. "
,jarno_nekdes,2008-06-08T22:12Z,"I fixed it. It turned out to be the .dll file. I didn't replace it properly. but now everything works fine! THAAANKSS, it is a lovely app"
