,Ross_at_home2002,2008-01-29T10:43Z,"Many thanks gavej1010 .......Managed to work out how to get Vista 32 bit working with Print CD on my R300 .My Print CD version was 1.2e your version is 1.4 ,which has  better compatibility  . I have now got my Vista 32 bit working with this version of  print CD  . It does not work on vista with ver print CD ver 120e . However wor around was I had to change the print driver from the default vista driver (visa reports it is  ver 1 ) vista installs ver 1 driver  in automatically  .so I got ver 5 from Epson web site . That driver from  Epson?s website is only available   for XP and is version 21540eu . This works perfectly in vista and it does not complain about compatibility . Hope this helps anyone tearing there hair out . Worth running restore points before you do stort fiddling  around though."

,funkbassman,2009-05-26T17:32Z,"Thankyou, thankyou and thankyou again. I had some trouble installing it but that's mostly because I'm not exactly a techy! I've got it done now and she works a dream. Epson wanted to charge ÂŁ10 for a copy of this which really pissed me off! - They said they'd had to remove the software from their website due to liscensing reasons... erm... surely it's their software? Anyway, thankyou for helping out with this!"
