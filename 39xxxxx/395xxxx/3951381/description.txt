The Enterprise edition offers support to localize remote databases like SQLServer and other. Visual JSP, ASP and PHP support makes it the most complete Sisulizer edition. It can be called from build tools to automate software distribution. The capability to access shared external translations memories like Trados (tm) (6.5 or higher) makes it the perfect solution for team development.

New: With the Enterprise Edition you now can also localize any HTML Help files (.chm). Of course the Enterprise edition has everything the smaller editions also have.
