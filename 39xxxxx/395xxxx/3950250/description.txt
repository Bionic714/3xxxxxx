Episode Number: 16 Season Num: 2 First Aired: Thursday December 27, 2007 

Jason Chambers and Bill Duff travel to South Korea, birthplace of one of the most 
acrobatic and physically punishing fighting styles in the world, Taekwondo. Our 
hosts travel to ancient fortresses, break marble slabs, and learn an insane arsenal 
of jumping, flying and spinning taekwondo kicks. They'll serve as bodyguards protecting 
a VIP from potential attack, and channel the fighting spirit of an ancient band of Korean 
warriors. It's all in service to their ultimate challenge: a full-on Tae Kwon Do battle 
with a former World Champ.
