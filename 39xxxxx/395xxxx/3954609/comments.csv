,DrOctaCoG,2007-12-31T03:20Z,Piiiiimp.  Thanks :)
,BlackBug,2007-12-31T06:45Z,Thanx radar201. I know it is for FSX. But can it be used with FS9; given that all the folder names in the archive are corrected ?
,radar201,2007-12-31T12:30Z,I'm not sure BlackBug. I think FS9 has it's own version
,stiffeg,2007-12-31T14:01Z,"req. 

Flight Environment X"
,Panodilo,2007-12-31T16:29Z,The world is modelled differently in FSX. This scenery can't just be dropped on top. Touches there.

,MBroony,2008-01-04T23:35Z,can someone seed plz thanks
,BlackBug,2008-01-08T16:53Z,"Sorry for such a delayed reply. But thanx for your responses. As for the scenery itself, ouch. I don't think there is a FS9 version of this baby. Was really hopeful it would work with FS9. But, then again, no regrets."
,far_isle,2008-01-13T21:46Z,Wow another awesome MegaScenery title - thanks!! Need help with fs9's Bird's Eye View Vol 1 -5 - seeders to the rescue?  Vol 1 is 100% but the rest are short - can anyone reseed to help keep these very nice FS9 Flight Simulator textures going?  Thnx for the rescue to those that can help out!
,far_isle,2008-01-15T01:36Z,"AMAZING! oops, sorry for shouting but . . . the fs community here rocks!  Less than 24 hrs. after a reseed request for Bird's Eye View 1-5 and BAM they are all seeded and now being offered.  For those that think GE Pro is too dark, BEV is an alternative.  One new request - anyone have Just Planes - Air Greenland?  There are now !30! people stuck at 28.4% Whoever reseeds this to full is truly an amazing hero.  Rescue Needed and Thnx 10K times."
,yeoldecaptain,2008-01-20T05:02Z,"radar201 -- THANK you so much for the contribution.

May I request to you or anyone else that we get hold of the latest Megascenery X California addons?"

,Title27GT,2008-01-20T15:15Z,"I don't get it, do I have to burn this to a disk?"
,yeoldecaptain,2008-01-24T19:20Z,"Nope.  ye don't.  It's an installer.  just run the EXE file.  :-)

And yes, let the utility change your FS settings.  You'll love it :-)"
,Title27GT,2008-01-27T03:51Z,"But..whenever I click on the EXE file, Windows Explorer just freezes up and I have to force quit it"
,DavidTexas,2008-04-20T00:01Z,Is this megascenery file still available?
,eslak,2009-05-14T15:20Z,"Can anyone upload Megascenery X Phoenix? I'm stuck at 80.7% on a file called MegasceneryX - Phoenix - FSX - Lasco45.
