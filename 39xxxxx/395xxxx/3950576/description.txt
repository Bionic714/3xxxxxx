This is the complete English dubbed version of the Anime series Eureka Seven, downloaded from various Cartoon World sources, and of very good quality.

It is the story of a boy, young Renton Thirston, leading a relatively sheltered and boring life until a beautiful but mysterious girl piloting a battle mech literally falls into his life when her mech crashes through his grandfather's garage.

From that point on, young Renton's life will never be the same as he joins the Gekko State and tries to win over his new love, Eureka (pronounced Elreka - a language translation problem), and eventually must try to save their world.
