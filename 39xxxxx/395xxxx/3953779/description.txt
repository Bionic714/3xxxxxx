Source: Retail R2 PAL DVD
Audio: English 5.1
Subs: English
Ripped: Nothing


IMPORTANT: This DVD only contains "The Story so Far", a 40 min. recap of S1&2; thus no new material if you have already seen those.
Unfortunately, it does NOT contain the webisodes, which the publisher for arcane reasons has decided no to include.
