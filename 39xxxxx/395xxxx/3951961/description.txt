Marvel, of course, are better known for superhero comics such as Spiderman and The Incredible Hulk and so it was a departure for them when, in 1976, they began to produce their own Classic Comics with Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The more popular and well known series, Classics Illustrated - www.classicsillustrated.co.uk - had finished in 1971 and Marvel felt they could re-invigorate the genre. In all 36 of them were produced and they were generally well drawn and well interpreted. Some gaffes were made - H.G.Wells? The First Men in the Moon was attributed to Jules Verne - and The Cyclops in Homer?s Odyssey was drawn as horned and purple - Marvel simply couldn?t stop drawing outlandish, out of this world monsters. Most of the titles had appeared in the CI series but two new ones were adapted - H. Rider Haggard?s She and Bram Stoker?s Dracula. After two years the series ended - like Kanter?s and later Frawley?s Classics Illustrated had found, children simply weren?t attracted to the old classic books, preferring Marvel?s superheroes - since then they have stuck to their knitting! The comics are very nice in their own right and their price is very affordable if you wanted to see other adaptations of major novels beyond the CI efforts.
