   Just a few weeks ago, Evel Knievel died at the age of 69. Here, Top Gear
   presenter Richard Hammond realises a childhood ambition when he comes 
   face to face with the American motorcycle stunt legend, whose daredevil
   feats made him a household name in the 1970s. Richard gets to the core of 
   the man who was as much famed for his bar brawls and womanising as his 
   death-defying stunts, and highlights the extremes of his personality. 
   Knievel chats to the Hamster about his many and varied stunts and crashes,
   and the fine line between life and death ù prompting the presenter to 
   discuss his own high-speed crash 15 months ago
