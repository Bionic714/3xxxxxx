,vslink,2008-03-21T11:42Z,"Does work, but has some minor glitches with image repaint when used with Leopard. Probably better for Leopard users to download the most recent version for the full Ps CS3 and apply this:

That is what I have done and have actually removed Elements from my Mac, even though I am very grateful for erbasvizzera's efforts. The full version of Ps is a little more complicated (not much) and it just looks and works better on an Intel Mac with Leopard."
,ephrite,2009-03-14T16:50Z,Everything works perfectly until I launch it! It starts up and then quits right before finishing the launch. Any suggestions?
,YpsiFrog,2009-04-12T02:29Z,"it's not the newest but maybe the only elements for mac at the PB, work for my leopard"
