Oh yeah! Alternatively trashy and poignant - and sometimes just plain hard to believe these days - here?s an irresistible program of Black Cinema trailers that trace its evolution through its most crucial period, 1946 - 1976.

Filled with insights on race and social dynamics, this fascinating compendium of Coming Attractions explores an extensive range of stylistic approaches - Blaxploitation, Comedy, Music Bio, Plantation Drama, and more ? all smartly organized by genre, or viewable as one outrageous joyride through motion picture history.

Beyond mere camp, these marvelously condensed gems crystallize a range of African-American identities and personalities, tracking the meteoric careers of Sidney Poitier, James Earl Jones, Billy Dee Williams, Richard Pryor, Pam Grier, et al, through their bold performances in movies both hugely popular and practically forgotten.

Be careful or you just might learn something.
