All but maybe the biggest of the CS3 torrents are missing the Encore DVD library 
and style directories.  Here are the equivalent Encore DVD 2.0 directories.   Unless 
you did something funny, just unrar into the Encore install directory and the 
program will pick it up. 

Since we are talking about 3+ gig here, the lib is divided up into Base, NTSC and PAL 
archives.   Download and install just what you need.

Also included are the Premiere Pro 2.0 DVD authoring templates.   They are compatible 
with Encore, just pick and choose as you want.
