Thinking? About Bison is an Avant-Garde Jazz/Noise band based in San Fransisco. They are comprised of Brian Brickell and Ted Clark,
young entrepreneurs who arose from the ranks of the east-coast vibraphone scene.
Their most critically acclaimed album is the 1985 album Loose Over the Magnetic Canyon Radiation Jeep, which blends a mixture of genres to form a torrential sound collage.
The band broke up in 1997, but has recently reformed and announced plans for a new album.
