The Hoosiers [formerly known as The Hoosier Complex] are an indie pop band from Reading, Berkshire and Stockholm, Sweden. The band members are Irwin Sparkes [vocals, guitar], Martin Skarendahl [bass] and Alfonso 'Alan' Sharland [drums]. The band claim to create a sound that they call "we want to be indie but we're not cool enough", a sound combining a number of musical genres. The band members cite their influences as The Cure, Jeff Buckley, The Flaming Lips and XTC. According to their band biography, Alfonso and Irwin spent some time in the United States. Having gathered enough material to compile an album, Alfonso and Irwin returned to London where they met Martin Skarendahl, a Swedish ex-fireman who was then working as a recording studio engineer. The trio signed to RCA and have recorded an album together entitled 'The Trick To Life'. The band have spoken of their desire to write songs that are about "more than just boy meets girl after a night on the lash", and say that the album will surprise people who only know their 2 singles.
