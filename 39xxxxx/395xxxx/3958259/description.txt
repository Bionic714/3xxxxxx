Afghanistan: Mission Impossible~ CBC National  2008 01 01 wmv

Since 2002, NATO and other countries have largely given up the quixotic notion of finding Osama Bin Laden and engaged in an undefined mission of ?nation-building?.

US, British, Dutch and Canadian forces bear the brunt of the military activity while ?caveats? protect other forces from the dangerous, thankless and perhaps fruitless pursuit of  the resurgent Taliban who now are taking war into the streets with suicide bombers and expanding  the insidious and  ever present peril of  IEDs. 

Five years of NATO activity has produced almost nothing concrete in the way of ?progress?.  What would light at the end of the tunnel even look like?
