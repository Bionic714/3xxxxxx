,skybluesky,2007-12-31T07:55Z,This appears to be the same file as http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3942109/I.Am.Legend.PROPER.DVDSCR.XviD.avi. Why a new torrent (esp. when there are only two seeders here)?
,cavedog,2007-12-31T08:35Z,There is now 598 seeders

,cavedog,2007-12-31T21:55Z,"If you use this trackers you will get all the seeds! Dont use trackers that no one uses then you wont get all the seeds!

,neocorpse,2008-01-01T09:46Z,"Hell I didn't even know this is out on DVD yet...lol. Even if it's not, and this is a Telesync it'll still be damn good quality. Thank you for the upload man, you won't hear ME complain...:D"
,neocorpse,2008-01-01T12:58Z,"yup, this is a telesync. excellent quality all the way through. no skips, or hangups. The sound stays nice and synced up the entire movie. There were a few spots you could tell it was dubbed over in studio, but that has nothing to do with the quality of this upload. My only real beef is Sam the dog died :( 
Damn sweet up man thank you :D"
,Shardus,2008-01-02T11:01Z,"Hey Cavedog, thanks for great upload"
,Gozarthegozarian,2008-01-02T17:06Z,Wish i woulda known this was the PAL version. Any one know how to burn PAL to play on NTSC?
,cholula69,2008-01-02T21:57Z,You can convert PAL to NTSC using Final Cut Pro.
