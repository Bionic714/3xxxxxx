,InSilenzi,2007-12-30T20:35Z,Would be nice with more info... Quality? Which albums?... shouldn't End of an era be included?
,Akria,2008-01-02T02:47Z,"Dark Passion Play (2 CD edition, normal and instrumental) - also included here is a demo version of The Poet And The Pendulum
Once
Century Child
From Wishes to Eternity
Over the Hills and Far Away
Wishmaster
Oceanborn
Angels Fall First

End of an Era was a DVD of their last live concert with Tarja, wasn't it? 
I have it, but I'm not seeding it until the Ultimate Nightwish Torrent Mk. 2 is complete (yes, I'm working on it; it will include DVDs and singles).

Quality is 192 kbps on more or less all of them, although Dark Passion Play might be higher. I can't recall off the top of my head."
