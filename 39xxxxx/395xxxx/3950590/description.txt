The Ultimate Nightwish Torrent Mk. I
____________________________________

As far as I'm aware, this is every album Nightwish have released. It includes lyrics in the metadata of each song; whether or not Windows Media Player buggered these up for any player other than itself, I don't know (they seem to work in iTunes at the least). It also includes image files including the front and back covers, CDs themselves, inlays and other assorted bits.
It doesn't include singles, but it does include some additional tracks related to the albums concerned. It doesn't include videos.

If there's something wrong (or you happen to be Nightwish themselves asking me to take the torrent down), then please e-mail me.
