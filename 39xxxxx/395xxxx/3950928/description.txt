Let's get the last of my re-posts out of the way before 2008 hits...



There are over 20 discogs entries for all the numerous formats and distributions of this release containing remixes by many different artists from the house scene.

None of them, however, contain an entry for the Pig & Dan Remix.

" Pig & Dan are made up on producers Dan Duncan & Igor Tchkotoua (Pig). They met a number of years ago and from there have developed an extremly solid and fruitful partnership. After a few months of producing together they signed a deal with Dutch label, Sadie Records, they began to enter into the market and gain success. This gave the duo a boost and they started to produce two/three tunes a week. They then decided that it would be a good idea to build their own record company 'Submission' and work together with Sadie to create a bigger market. The rest is history.

At present they have the likes of Anthony Pappa and Sander Kleinenberg adding their tracks to their new CD compilations, and have found a space in the record box's of many well known DJ's including the likes of Deep Dish, Sasha, John Digweed, Laurent Garnier and Hernan Cattaneo.

Submissions new CD 'Submission Sessions' mixed by Pig + Dan featuring all exclusive material and will be available August 1st 2004. Submission events around worldwide featuring Pig & Dan and other named DJ's. Finishing the artist album for later this year. Plenty of twelve inch singles to come from Submission, Tecmission and Sadie Records / Orange Dance Company. "
