*THIS IS NOT A REMASTER BUT THE ORIGINAL VINYL AS IT WAS MEANT TO SOUND*

The Dark Side of the Moon is a concept album by the British progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released in 1973 and engineered by Alan Parsons. It is notable for its use of Musique concrete and philosophical lyrics, something that would eventually become a trademark of Pink Floyds music. The album was a landmark in rock music, as it featured radio-friendly songs such as Money, Time, Us and Them and Brain Damage. Some music critics use the album as a point of reference in determining between classic blues rock and the new genre of electronic music.

The Dark Side of the Moon explores the nature of the human experience. For example, Time deals with aging and the overwhelmingly fast approach of death. Money deals with materialism with tongue-in-cheek lyrics and wealth-related sound effects. Us and Them deals with conflict, ethnocentrism, and the belief that a persons self is always in the right.

By the way, the vinyl version sounds MUCH better than the CD.
