So, I was warned before I downloaded it... And here I was  to complain about the audio crackling."
,JoshM22,2008-04-11T05:26Z,uncompressed FLAC would have been the better choice. I am happy with this though for now. Nice to hear this album in vinyl on my digital stereo system. Once I get an analog reciever then i will pull out the real vinyl.
