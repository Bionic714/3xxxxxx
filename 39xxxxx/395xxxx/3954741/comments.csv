,Valmarith,2010-01-06T13:56Z,"This is a fully working english copy of Star Ocean - The Second Story, I played it through from start to finish no problem.

Please Note: There are a lot of Gameshark issues with this game, the game will not work well with PEC, Using the Voice Collection enabler may cause an error when entering battle. If you must cheat, use a back up copy on a seperate memory card and disable PEC as soon as the desired cheat is being used, always keep a 'cheat free' save."

,dimlyFour,2012-05-24T11:40Z,"Good torrent. I am running ePSXe and have fiddled around with a couple plugin variants, but am still getting the following errors:

-can't move in battle
-can't move up-right while running in town map

Good story, nice torrent, but wondering if anyone has run into these issues."
