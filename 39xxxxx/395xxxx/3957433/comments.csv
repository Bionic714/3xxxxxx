,catchow58,2008-01-02T06:35Z,"It's sort of bullshit, in a way.    Most  of the ""books"" appear to be short stories from ""Night Shift""... but it's still a VERY worthwhile download.  Includes some real classics like ""the Shining"" and ""Carrie"".  There are three torrents for Carrie on Pirate Bay, and all three of them appear to be deader than Elvis... and it all downloaded in about two minutes!  Great download, much thanks!"

Glad someone likes them. ;>)

Please seed for others."
,catchow58,2008-01-02T08:07Z,Note:  Does NOT contain The Shining... that was my mistake.
,catchow58,2008-01-02T13:34Z,"That 1400 ebook torrent DOES contain the shining, and several King books not available here.  That was also a surprisingly quick download and highly reccomended."
,naughtynina,2008-01-10T17:28Z,"i don't want to be a party pooper but when i unzipped this torrent there was only 39 html ebooks, they are fantastic with a few missing, recommended."
,naughtynina,2008-01-10T17:31Z,sorry 36 ebooks
,Fedjeviking,2008-01-11T17:33Z,"Sorry, I just counted the files listed. ;>) I'll try to do better in the description in the future. Hope you enjoyed what was in this anyway."
