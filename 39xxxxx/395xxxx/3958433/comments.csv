,ltrtiger,2008-01-07T12:39Z,"Appreciate the contribution, but you have to keep seeding.  At this point, I'm done.  Stuck at 24% with no progress.  Yeah...thanks."

,bungie240,2008-01-08T23:59Z,"Got to 24.4% and it stopped, (EMPLEHOD) are u still seeding?"
,murmelwurmel,2008-01-09T00:01Z,Emplehod seems to be a fake. The Blade Runner DVD did not work and now he's not coming back to finish seeding this one...
,Emplehod,2008-01-09T03:31Z,"murmelwurmel:

I am not fake. I have better things to do than try to use all my bandwidth to upload fake files. Blade Runner (DVD5) is fine and there are 50+ seeders to show that.  Blade Runner DVD9 had a decryption problem so I deleted the torrent.

If you don't want to download my torrents, then that's your prerogative."
,Emplehod,2008-01-09T03:41Z,"bungie240:

Sorry I had stopped this temporarily to seed Blade Runner (mentioned above) because people were complaining of slow speed.  I did not realize that it would be so slow (these are my first torrents) and tried to seed too many.

I have restarted this one because the other was bad.  Sorry.  If everyone wants, I can stop uploading torrents altogether and just be a leecher like murmelwurmel.

Many thanks for your effoerts."
,Emplehod,2008-01-09T09:00Z,"DrBlaze:

I also have originals for:

Matrix 1, 2 and 3
The Riddick Trilogy (includes Pitch Black)
Sky Captain

and I have AVP.

The reason I didn't those is I was posting only those with DTS. I think ""Code 46"" and ""I, Robot"" I might like.

I haven't looked at the private torrent feature.

bungie240:

Appreciate the kudos.

From now on, I will be sure to test every ISO before I upload it.  I have another one ready:

Starship Troopers 2 - DTS & DD5.1"
,Emplehod,2008-01-09T09:10Z,"Was wondering if anyone would be interested in the H.G. Wells' ""First Men In The Moon""?  Yes, this is the 1964 classic, but this version has been digitally remastered in High Definition, it's anamorphic, and it has 4.0 Discrete Surround (English). Subtitles are in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean and Thai  :)"
,sanjuro_61,2008-01-09T11:51Z,"So Brazil has a decryption problem too?
BRAZIL: FINAL CUT - Criterion Collection DVD9 http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3950582
-> Error 404: Not Found :("
,Emplehod,2008-01-09T22:12Z,"sanjuro61:
Yes, that one did, but there's a fixed one. Sorry for the inconvenience.

,sanjuro_61,2008-01-09T23:47Z,"Ok, thank you."
,tomca,2008-01-10T03:55Z,"Emplehod, could you please please please pleaseee upload a fixed version of the DVD9 of Blade Runner? Please!"
,Emplehod,2008-01-10T08:08Z,"tomca:
I will, but I can't do any more seeding until my current seeds are healthy.

Can anyone more experienced tell me how to determine this?  I'm using uTorrent, if that makes a difference."
,BikerTrash2003,2008-01-12T18:44Z,"Please seed! I know PB shows one seeder but it must be wrong. I am stuck at 62.9%. I will seed (along with others, I hope) when completed. 
TYVM"
,bungie240,2008-01-13T14:35Z,"Please seed mate, seems that the seeding is on & off!!??


Cheers"
,spacemen3,2008-01-14T00:25Z,Please seed!  I will seed after completion.

Take a look:

You can also check the ""leech-progress"" at the bottom of the utorrent window:

The other one may be confusing..."
,sanjuro_61,2008-01-14T20:52Z,"Ouch, made a mistake (must take a few more english lessons :) ) 
I meant ""the higher the number..."""
,Emplehod,2008-01-15T00:32Z,"Thanks.

Well, according to this shot of my statistics, I guess I don't qualify as a leecher.

And why is this torrent indicator red now? It has been green all along until this evening.  The upload rate is still at 47kB/s.  Isn't that pretty good for a standard DSL connection?

And BTW, sanjuro, my diagrams are much nicer than yours :)"
,Emplehod,2008-01-15T00:36Z,"Oh crap!  I forgot the link.  They need an edit here.

http://shaiya.kicks-aZZ.net/images/torrent.jpg

(you have to change the ZZ to ss.  It won't let me post that nasty URL  :)"
,sanjuro_61,2008-01-15T13:33Z,"Red arrow means that utorrent can't connect with tracker (maybe ""out of time""). 

That picture:
Check the ""availability"". 
It says 1.801. 
""1"" is you. 
.801 is the leecher(s) with most % completed (that is 80.1%)

I think it's pretty clear now :)

BTW: ..., please DON'T forget all the Brazil's leechers."
,Emplehod,2008-01-16T23:42Z,"Here's some helpful info:

""Almost all viruses are attached to an executable file, which means the virus may exist on your computer but it cannot infect your computer unless you run or open the malicious program. It is important to note that a virus cannot be spread without a human action, (such as running an infected program) to keep it going.""

So how did you load and run an image that you had no more than 50% of?"
,Emplehod,2008-01-16T23:43Z,"Sorry, that last post got in wrong torrent :)"
,tomca,2008-01-29T18:06Z,"Emplehod, please upload Blade Runner DVD9!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,xyz3352008,2008-10-24T03:50Z,"just download and no english sub

suck"
,Emplehod,2010-07-12T05:11Z,@ xyz3352008nnWhy would you need English subs?  the language is English.
,e-lex,2011-02-12T16:56Z,Could you please reseed the torrent?
