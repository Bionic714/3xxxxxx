Hello,

I am fairly new to uploading on TPB.  Because I have enjoyed downloads in the past, I wanted to give back to the community.  It took me a while to get an account here because I wasn't getting the confirmation email.

There are two kinds of video downloaders: Those who just want to get it quick, watch it, and then dump it, and those who want the full viewing experience or want to burn it to DVD-R and keep it.  Both are valuable contributions.  My files are for the latter type.  These files are large, many are DVD9, and I am not removing anything from the original disc. They are created using CloneDVD2 and burned in ISO image format.

OVERVIEW:


A lone time traveler from the year 2035 must solve a riddle that may save his people...but it may take him to the brink of madness. Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt star in this brilliant sci-fi masterpiece from Terry Gilliam, the acclaimed director of 'The Fisher King'.

After the world's population is devastated by a killer virus, survivors must live in the dank underground communities. Cole (Willis) "volunteers" to travel into the past to obtain a pure virus sample, thereby helping scientists develop a cure. Along the way, he crosses paths with a beautiful psychiatrist (Stowe) and a one-card-short-of-a-full-deck mental patient (Pitt). But the race is on, as Cole searches for The Army Of The 12 Monkeys, a radical group linked to the deadly disease.

With unforgettable performances and imaginative special effects, '12 Monkeys' is a modern-day classic laced with Gilliam's trademark wit and dazzling visual style.
