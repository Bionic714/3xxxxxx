This game is relatively new (release 27.01.2006), but there are few chances for release in english... Lost in Astral is a very specific standalone addon, with VERY different (from original EI) gameplay and NO multiplayer. Very specific game, so not very popular. "

This addon was intended originally as a mod for Evil Islands (more like ""Cursed Lands"" in Russian), made by some fans. Mod wasn't the best, but this team had managed to deal with Nival (developer of original) and some time later this stand-alone addon was born.
Graphics hasn't changed at all since the original, all the elements are the same except pathfinding (it's much worse than in Evil Islands), all 3 islands are the same (there's a new one also), but gameplay is incredibly shifted towards stealth (that's hard to believe since the original was a stealth action-rpg, but that's the fact).

Here's original Evil Islands score at Russian site ag.ru (2000): 90%.
And that's the addon (2006. the same site, even the same author reviewed the game): 37%.

Game is much much worse than original, so if you don't know Russian, don't bother downloading it - replay Evil Islands instead. If you do know Russian, I don't know why are you even reading this - addon is shit."
