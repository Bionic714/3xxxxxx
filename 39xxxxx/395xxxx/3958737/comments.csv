,vigfus,2008-02-07T16:48Z,"There seems to be an error in dearly devoted dexter. I think there is a bit from darkly dreaming dexter jammed in there on cd 2. It's from 03:30 ""i opened them again..."". Am i right or am i getting stuff mixed up?"
,tvjohan,2008-02-12T22:40Z,"Too much acting, it spoils the splendid writing. Is there another narrator out there?"
,vigfus,2008-02-18T17:02Z,"There is also a definite error in the second-to-last disc (i think it's #7). The first track is played twice...

You don't loose anything, it's just bloody annoying."
,kompanj,2008-07-27T23:08Z,could someone plz upload the swedish translations of DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER? Its called DEXTERS DUNKLADE DRÖMMAR on swedish.

,phatfish78,2009-04-28T17:57Z,Varför böja översättningen överhuvudtaget? Dexters mörka drömmar blir det och inget annat.
,phatfish78,2009-04-28T17:58Z,...men ändå fel menings byggnad

,KentAntonPhilip,2010-02-14T06:15Z,"Jag tror att de valt att översätta Darkly Dreaming Dexter till Dexters dunkla drömmar, eftersom originaltiteln är på alliteration.. och bör även översättningen vara det enligt min mening.."
