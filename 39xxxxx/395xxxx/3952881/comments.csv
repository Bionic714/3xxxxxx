but otherwise if you do, this is definitely a must see..."

Dear Darkvolva, opera is when lots of people sing, ballet is when lots of people dance.
There is no singing in this production, but there are a lot of people dancing.
This leads me to to believe it's a ballet.
The other reason I know it's a ballet is because there is no opera of Romeo and Juliet composed by Prokofiev that I know of."
