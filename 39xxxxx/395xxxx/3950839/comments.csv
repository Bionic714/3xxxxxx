,ma mad,2007-12-28T20:10Z,"jag har fått reda på att det kan uppstå ett problem när man skall installera ""alexander"" trots att man har rätt patchar.
Det står att man måste ha 1.5 & 1.6 patch.
om någon har någon lösning på detta problem hade jag varit tacksam om ni berättade det här för oss andra så vi också kan spela detta spel.
tack på förhand"

1.Download This#
2.Extract the RAR and the other files all in one place in your computer#
3.Use Daemon Tools or Alcohol or what you have on the mount image.
4.Complete the instructions and wait for the install to finish
5.Goto my computer and click open with your right mouse button and you should see the crack folder.
5.Cop the crack to the main RTW folder and replace the crack with the original one.
6.There now have fun and play :).

,Wiyam,2010-03-22T12:11Z,"HELP PLS...when trying to install it says: An error (-5003: ox5) has occured while running the setup
please make sure you have finished any previous setup and closed other applications. 
the prob is i dont have any other app open but this file...wat shud i do???"
,inoksvere,2010-05-04T04:19Z,"@rivast, you don't try to move the crack to the RTW files on the mounted image. put the crack exe into your rtw installation folder. (program files/activision etc) then run the crack exe and it should work fine.

@tonioni, you are an idiot. RTW: Alexander is an ""EXPANSION"" so YES you need the original Rome Total War for it to be played.

thanks for the upload ma mad."

,JxNe,2010-12-17T21:44Z,"OK, just spent the last 30 min trying  to get this to work. I'm stuck trying to get patch 1.5 to work. Patch 1.3 installed just fine after deleting the files in the InstallShield folder. But when I try to install Patch 1.5, it says that it needs patch 1.3. Patch 1.3 is already installed and is in the Program Files folder of Rome Total War. Forums on Total War have no solution to this problem as nowhere else, anyone know of any? any help is greatly appreciated.

*note: do we really have to pricks to people who are new to downloading and configuring games off the internet. Don't be an asshole, instead of being one, why not help them out? "
,flypro1,2011-05-28T05:27Z,"JxNe, you have to uninstall 1.3 patch and then install it again. Then, install 1.5. If you get the message after uninstalling 1.3 saying if you want to uninstall RTW, click no or cancel, whatever."
