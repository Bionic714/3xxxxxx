We're up to our virtual sphincters in Computer manuals, weight loss plans, conspiracy theories, hate literature, books about picking up women, and dubious plans for penis enlargement.  We've needed more books that you read for pleasure..  At my age (50 in March) I'm finding reading from an LCD monitor a lot more comfortable than reading from a book.  I don't need glasses or six feet long arms.   

Stephen King is exactly what I came here looking for, and I can't believe my good luck."
,Fedjeviking,2008-01-02T20:34Z,"catchow58--I'm 58 and in college! This is my winter break. I'm just getting to go through this library that my nephew in the service provided. Of course I have many of what you are talking about. 
I also see many authors such as Koontz, Kellerman, Grisham, Griffin, Clancy, Clavell to name a few! The library has authors from A-Z! This thing has literally THOUSANDS of books in it! 
And I intend on sharing as much as possible!"
,catchow58,2008-01-03T19:03Z,"I'm reading The Shining right now... it's been years since I've actually read a book, and I was an English major in college!  If you have anything by Patricia Cornwall, that would be much appreciated."

I don't know how I'm going to get enough paper to print all the stuff I haven't read yet, I sure as hell won't read them straight off the computer screen. My eyes are bad enough as it is ;)"

You really don't have to print out these books, that is a waste of time and money.

You should search for TTS (Text-to-Speech) software on TPB.  Then you can sit back, relax, and have your computer ""read"" to you . . ."

Ah well."
