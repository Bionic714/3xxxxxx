,Balfor,2007-12-30T11:56Z,"They never seem to address what happens to the small-time musician, graphic artist, software dev or film-maker, who are the ones that get hurt the most. In fact, if these kind of artworks weren't digital and easily transferable with P2P, they wouldn't have much of an argument -- which is bullshit. In their argument, the small guys still lose and the big corps will always stay rich -- so once again the *people* are the losers. If they could be a little more intelligent about it they could come up with a better argument and solution that is fair to everybody.

I love P2P and enjoy grabbing big hollywood movies made by mega-corps like Sony, etc., and music from mega-rich record companies (like Sony, etc.) but I think it sucks to see people *collecting for free and then trying to justify* little software apps that sell for $7.95, etc., made by small-time devs who are struggling to fucking eat."

,pnardy,2007-12-31T12:46Z,"This is a brilliant and controversial documentary that I've truly enjoyed.

I'd say the need of humans to reproduce themselves is another example of ""copying"" and ""copyright infringement"". Being one of the very basic building blocks of human society, this is a natural thing to do that should come free, without a price tag, without the need of asking someone's permission. Although this might not seem an issue right now, we will have to fight for this cause in the future, just like some people fight for P2P information sharing and consider themselves ""pirates"" in a ""pioneer"" sense now. P2P already has become a common way of producing and distributing information in the society.

The human society changes rapidly on a global scale thanks to the internet. The whole new structure, a blueprint for the future model of the whole human society starts to emerge. Old economic and political system we knew for so long will go away or adopt to the new changes. I think, money-based economic systems will eventually cease to exists and we'll have a money-free control-free society based on wise exploitation of natural resources. The fight/""war on change"" has already began.

I think open debates should be organized on many websites on the question of intellectual property laws, forthcoming global social changes, future ways for new economies, P2P mass productions and distribution. The current copyright infringement laws are obviously outdated and should not stop people from sharing and creating new information."

,3echo,2008-01-04T01:57Z,"""Hi!

We, the group of anticopyright activists from Russia, ask you for help.
The point is that 04.12.07 there was the first time in Russia when a man
was sentenced for filesharing.
Sergey Avramov created a torrent for a software of the russian company ""1C"".

We think its just the first step, after that will follow new repressions
towards filesharing supporters.

In our view, the only appropriate way to put pressure on the company is to
create a new torrent on an independent server outside Russia and the
forthcoming promotion of the link.

This step will show the uselessness of repressive actions towards users of
filesharing networks.

We ask you to create a torrent seed for the software ""1c_enterprise"". 
[...]
With hope for solidarity.

,sheridoll,2009-08-18T11:26Z,"Just discovered TPB and am STOKED.  
I want to add that not everybody has the money to support their favorites actors and musicians For example, me.  I am mentally ill (schizo, baybay!) and collect Social Security.  I try to buy as many CDs and movies as I can afford but there is A TON of music and movies in this world, and I don't see it as being possible to explore and enjoy it all unless you are filthy stinking rich.  
I think filesharing is a miracle invention.  I also think it could be used in positive ways.  For example, take Radiohead.  


Radiohead releases free download

Radiohead released a new track Monday on its Web site, ?These are My Twisted Words,? and offered hints that there?s more to come.

http://radiohead.com/deadairspace/

    ?We've been recording for a while, and this was one of the first we finished,? wrote band member Jonny Greenwood in introducing the free download. He also mentioned ?There's other stuff in various states of completion.?

    The track begins with a lengthy instrumental section pinning reverberating guitar against percolating drums and a counterpoint string arrangement, then adds a dreamy Thom Yorke vocal about 2 ½-minutes in. The track takes on increasing psychedelic overtones, dispensing with verse-chorus structure in favor of an expanding series of instrumental colors that echoes ?Meddle?-era Pink Floyd. 

    The download also comes with 15 pages of stark black-and-white printable artwork that the band suggests arranging ?in an order that pleases you.?

    The U.K. quintet?s last album, the 2007 ?In Rainbows,? was released in similar fashion on its Web site. It was available for two months as a download at a price of the fans? choosing (including free), and later went on to sell 3.1 million copies worldwide.

    On Aug. 5, the band made a charity single available on the Web site, ?Harry Patch (in Memory of), a somber ballad in tribute to the last surviving member of the British army who fought in World War I; Patch died in July at the age of 111.

If only more musicians and movie stars were as awesome as Radiohead, then maybe they would find that not being stingy with their creations wins over the fans more than anything.  I mean, I am more likely to purchase a movie or CD by an artists or actor that isn't in it for the money and is strictly in it for the fans and their own creative visions.
