Don't worry. I'll keep seeding. I just may slow down when my wife and I are playing online games, or she's using the microwave."
,Fringe4,2008-02-08T05:16Z,"I've seeded to 11.4x

How many people want me to seed more?"
,phobelexx,2008-04-04T15:45Z,I'm at 92%. Is this torrent still being seeded? 
,cronos12,2008-04-29T06:15Z,"I lost this file.  Would like to get this movie back again.  Please seed!  I'll hold the seed a while after.

Thanks"

,Fringe4,2008-06-04T04:37Z,"Sorry guys, my wife keeps adjusting my speed down so she can play WoW with no packet loss."
,Sithoid,2008-06-09T03:52Z,"Can you seed it on low speed, though? After I get it, I`ll seed at least for a month."
,Fringe4,2008-06-10T13:42Z,"What I try to do is seed it full speed (@~90kb) when she isn't online, and then I seed capped @ 30kb when she is online.

But when she adjusts the speed, when I'm not around, she cuts it down to 5kb, or just pauses it.

I'm honestly surprised this torrent is as popular as it is."
,Sithoid,2008-06-20T21:11Z,"It`s popular because it`s rare :) I guess it`s the only film adaptation of Ayn Rand`s novels. I like the ideas, and I like movies - so I`m glad that there`s a whole DVD.

96,2%... nearly there!"
,Fringe4,2008-08-06T21:32Z,Seeded to 24x. I may take this down soon.
,bubbared,2008-08-30T10:23Z,"Starting 8/30/08, if i can get to 100% I'll seed for a long time, this is a very important film in my opinion :)"

That's great an all, but governments kill out of whim, and power, and it is always involuntary.

I'm not sure, really, where your quote draws it's example from because we have never had a institution of capitalism on this planet. The only actual capitalism we have seen has been on the micro level, between individuals. But we have never had a real free market on this planet for Marx, or Stalin, or whoever else, to draw an example from.

Government on the other hand, we see every day, and we know it's perils."
,Javelynn,2008-12-12T04:41Z,Thanks for seeding!
,Sprite0,2008-12-26T05:10Z,Could someone ban this LeninistStalinist idiot please?  He's pasted the same anti-civilization propaganda bull ~400 times (according to Google)!
,Fringe4,2009-03-24T00:27Z,I've seeded this for over a year now. I'm glad to see people are enjoying it.
,lizzyborden,2009-03-29T07:10Z,Cheers mate! Seeding for 1 year. Wow! Much respect to the seeder. :)
,garycarradine,2011-09-04T22:09Z,"I wonder why this movie is located in ""video movies""? This should be labeled as DVD-R. Because all the files came exactly from a dvd. anyway great movie. :))"
