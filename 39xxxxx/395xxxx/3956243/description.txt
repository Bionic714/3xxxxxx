Doug E. Fresh & The Get Fresh Crew\\\'s first 2 classic albums. \\\'Oh My God!\\\' was taken straight from my vinyl copy. I also added \\\"La Di Da Di\\\", the 12\\\" version of \\\"The Show\\\" and the 12\\\" version of \\\"Play This Only At Night\\\".

\\\'The World\\\'s Greatest Entertainer\\\' was ripped directly from an original CD.
