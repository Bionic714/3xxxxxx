,Rhoq,2008-01-01T15:37Z,I figured these are albums that a lot of people have been looking for. I'm hoping that Fantasy Records will see that there is still high demand for these classics and re-release Doug E. Fresh's entire Danya/Reality Records catalog in the U.S.

Here's to DJs who play that real hip-hop,
not for popularity reasons, just for the love of the art."
