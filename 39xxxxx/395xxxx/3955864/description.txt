This is of the highest quality  *****

Note from the cover
This harvested release originates from newly discovered unprocessed source, unlike most of the existing RoIOs of these BBC tapes. This source is probably as close to the BBC pre-FM masters as you can get.

The audio was carefully re-mastered  in order to make the recording really shine with clear high end and excellent dynamics avoiding any NR processing or de-hissing which would have altered the music.

BBC Archives 1974 brings you this Famous BBC recording in its most complete form ( the lines Ãƒ?Ã¯Â¿Â½ve been mad for fucking yearsÃƒ?Ã¯Â¿Â½ as well as the applause and tuning between Eclipse and Echoes are present), offering the best possible quality for your listening pleasure!
