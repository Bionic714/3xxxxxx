,darkpoet1978,2008-03-09T17:15Z,"This may be better for 'The Million Dollar Quartet' - http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3776008/Elvis_-_The_Complete_Million_Dollar_Quartet

To be more precise about what tracks are missing from this torrent:

One Piece At A Time: 8. Daughter Of A Railroad Man 9. Love Has Lost Again

Original Sun Sound: 1. Always Alone 9. New Mexico 11. Two Timing Woman

...also I've noticed bunches of these MP3s have problems when being re-tagged or adding album art in-file... But this is still an amazing torrent."
,darkpoet1978,2008-03-09T19:40Z,"A further note on missing tracks:

Happiness Is You: 4. You Comb Her Hair 6. For Lovin' Me 7. No One Will Ever Know 8. Is This My Destiny? 9. A Wound Time Can't Erase 10. Happy to Be with You

,persson__92,2008-03-10T22:41Z,"You know what? I just loooooove you guys uploading this!!! What a torrent! Perfect! Thank you very f**ucking much! :D

But it's not every single album though, but i think that's hard to get. I mean; Cash has done so extremly many albums, and 54 of them is really good to upload:D 

Keep up the good work! :D"
,spazoid,2008-03-12T07:34Z,"Thanks for the update Darkpoet!

If you find torrents with the missing tracks, please do post them here so I can update my collection!"
,_404,2008-04-11T23:16Z,"Great selection of albums but there is a serious problem -- Any album that contains the track ""Walk The Line"" is missing that track. Most of the albums pointed out by Darkpoet are the ones missing that song but there are several other e has missed."
,_404,2008-04-12T14:27Z,"Not sure if the torrent was fixed or if something screwy was going on with my download but the albums with ""I Walk The Line"" are complete again. "
,bertilbulle,2008-05-13T21:27Z,"I would seriously appreciate anybody's tip as to where I can find ""På Österåker"" from 1973. Yup, that's Johnny Cash playing in Swedish prison."
,bertilbulle,2008-05-13T21:29Z,"My bad, I spelled it wrong. Found it."
,MasterBate,2008-05-31T13:07Z,"Hey, I downloaded this, becouse I thought it was the COMPLETE discography. The main reason I wanted this was the track ""Hurt"", wich can't be found anywhere in this torrent.

I've seen others complain about missing tracks!

Don't call it a complete discography, if tracks are missing!!"
,aka0z,2008-06-15T20:22Z,"@ MasterBate (hehe)

Hurt can be found on the 'American IV' album here, http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3279290/Johnny_Cash_-_American_IV_-_The_Man_Comes_Around_(as_requested)

It should be noted that it was originally a song by the Nine Inch Nails that Cash covered.

With the exception of the two missing tracks I believe this is a complete discography up to 1993.  If you want his more recent albums, which are mostly covers then here you go:

,ithasn,2008-07-10T03:41Z,"This is an awesome list of music!
My better half actually owns some of the original Sun vinyl recordings of Mister Cash."
,Flem3000,2008-09-23T00:00Z,"I came here looking for ""Junkie and the Juicehead Minus Me"" from 1974. Does anyone know where I can find that? Great torrent though. I have about 25 Johnny Cash CDs, but this torrent will get me up to speed."
,sjdude,2008-10-27T02:00Z,"This is a nice collection, but there is far more than a few tracks missing, or just a few albums. It's not even close to being complete through 1993 as someone had suggested. Through 1993, Johnny Cash had 83 albums, and that's not including 29 compilation albums."
,alienMOAC,2008-12-16T21:49Z,thanks a billion spazoid. you rule.
,capnpat,2009-01-07T16:07Z,"thx spazoid...regardless of level of completeness, this is an awesome collection.  I have a renewed interest in the man in black's stuff so this is just what the doctor ordered!  I will seed 'til at least a ratio of 10:1."
,kds2012,2009-01-26T16:09Z,"Question: Is anybody finding this DL corrupted? Ie, incomplete mp3's &/or mp3's showing 0:00 length &/or containing large gaps of silence in the music?

Could be me, but I'd hate to seed otherwise. Please feedback."
,SplashySheBe,2009-03-27T00:54Z,"Omfgosh. If you don't like it, don't download it. This guy took all this time to get pretty much everything he could by Johnny Cash for you unappreciative people. Well, I say kudos Spaz. Thanks a million. Keep up the good work man(:"
,systat,2009-04-07T19:24Z,"Remember: If you like it, BUY IT!

No, I don't think so, guys is dead so he obviously don't need money anymore, I don't want to give it to someone that doesn't have anything with these songs"

,DunWun2,2010-03-02T05:05Z,"@ systat
Yes, if you like it, BUY IT. 
ASCAP pays copyright holders ""the life of the composer plus 75 years"".
Johnny & June are dead but Roseanne and John Carter are still alive. Plus, he didn't write all of the songs so there are other writers and musicians involved that deserves their money for their work too!"
