Well not that I have nothing to comment about this band, but the best way to have an idea is to listen their music... Contrabass, accordeon, guitar, clarinet, percussions... Many instruments for a trio!

The best of course is to understand the lyrics which are in French.

Enjoy!

And don't forget to share!
