[T],castortroy4693,2008-01-02T05:00Z,"Sorry, my bad!  I rebooted my computer last night, and forgot to restart BitTorrent.  It should be Seeding now."
,Tanneeeuuuuhhh,2008-01-02T22:59Z,"PLZ seed
it's just 7.5kb/sec, I want to have this game PLZ!
((I'm downloading with Azureus, is that good??))"
[T],castortroy4693,2008-01-03T03:38Z,"I don't know anything about Azureus, so I can't comment if it is good.  I am using BitTorrent 6.0.

Also, I have enabled the Scheduler.  During the night hours (between 10pm and 7am CST, it will run at full speed).  During the day, though, I have to watch my bandwidth usage, because I remote into my computer from work a lot, so I can't have all my upload being used.

Hopefully this'll help.  "
,Tanneeeuuuuhhh,2008-01-03T10:33Z,"the downloading speed is sometimes 120kb/s
but is change a lot to a very low downloading speed
keep seeding"

,Tanneeeuuuuhhh,2008-01-03T17:56Z,"I've mout the file with Daemon Tools (virtual DVD))
I want to play it but it's asking voor the original dvd
HELP plz"
[T],castortroy4693,2008-01-03T21:10Z,"Yes, thats right.  The NO CD Crack is not included, you must find it on your own.  You need version 2.0.  Do a websearch for it."
,biggiz,2008-01-04T16:23Z,Okey i have dowloaded a crack now how do i use it? my brother just to do this =D
[T],castortroy4693,2008-01-04T16:37Z,"Dunno. Usually, the crack needs to be copied over the existing file.  Check the .nfo that came with the crack.  That should tell you how to use it.  .nfo - right click on the file, Open With - Notepad or Wordpad."
[T],castortroy4693,2008-01-07T04:30Z,"To everyone who was leaching this file

,GameKiller01,2008-04-20T18:50Z,"Alright, I must admit, I am very new to this site and torrents so I would like to know how you do see and why some of the downloads are zips? I haven't played GTA 3 in forever ever since my PS2 broke and I never got it again. Trying to downlaod it again until GTA 4 comes out"
,SGT_Blades,2008-05-12T07:38Z,"note to all: do not ever use limewire to download a torrent file it did not find itself bcuz it will always say ""connecting"" or searching for sources"" or ""not enough sources"" because it's a piece of shit. Just use Azureus or BitTorrent, THEY ARE WAAAAAAAAAY BETTER.
nice download rate i capped it off at about 160kbps average about 60-80kbps. took a LOOOOOOOOOOOONG time still"
,Waggs15,2008-06-15T01:03Z,"This really needs better seeders...
