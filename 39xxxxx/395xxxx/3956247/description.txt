California girl group the Honeys was formed in 1961 by siblings Marilyn, Diane, and Barbara Rovell; originally dubbed the Rovell Sisters, the trio cut their teeth on the local amateur talent circuit, and in time Barbara was replaced by their cousin Sandra Glantz, who adopted the stage name Ginger Blake. Through producer Gary Usher, the Rovells were introduced to the Beach Boys\' Brian Wilson, who agreed to produce the group; rechristened the Honeys Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ a nickname for female surfers Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ they reeled off a series of outstanding Capitol singles including \"Shoot the Curl,\" \"Pray for Surf,\" and the Phil Spector homage \"The One You Can\'t Have,\" none of which made any kind of commercial impact. A move to Warner Bros. preceded 1964\'s superb \"He\'s a Doll\"; on December 7 of that year, Brian Wilson and Marilyn Rovell were also married. Despite their continuing lack of chart success, the Honeys remained sought-after backing vocalists on sessions for the Beach Boys and Jan & Dean; during the mid-\'60s, the trio also recorded as Ginger & the Snaps, although by the time of their 1969 swan song \"Goodnight My Love\" the Honeys name had been restored. When Blake left the group to pursue a solo career, Marilyn and Diane worked under the name American Spring; in 1983, the Honeys reunited for a disappointing comeback record, Ecstasy.
