,kerouac1,2008-01-04T21:34Z,"Nimar , how about superseeding it? TIA!"
,kerouac1,2008-01-04T22:13Z,Superseeding-go to pref/advanced/default seeding - superseed
,kerouac1,2008-01-05T00:26Z,WTF? Three days and it's only 72% seeded.
,kerouac1,2008-01-05T00:59Z,"Nimar-you must SUPERSEED it, lol. You keep stopping, restarting and reposting the same files. Superseeding will post the missing files first, and many new seeders will be generated."
,leboots,2008-01-05T04:55Z,please seed!! we are all stuck at 80%
