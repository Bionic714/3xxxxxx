,Dankouver,2007-12-30T09:12Z,Hey i see you adding these and i just want to know will you just upload the whole fucking thing???
,cucillo,2007-12-30T09:16Z,No I wont.
,Dankouver,2007-12-30T09:25Z,"Oh well, thanks for being quick with it. "
,cucillo,2007-12-30T09:27Z,my upload is not fast enough to put up an entire event...it would take me forever....so just a few fights here and there is the best I can do. Sorry. 
,Dankouver,2007-12-30T09:31Z,"Hey bud no problem, if you get the chance add the matt hughes v.s. gsp fight.

also i could post these at mininova for you and give you the credit of course. with your permission."
,Iceburgslim,2007-12-30T09:46Z,He just stopped uploading....
,cucillo,2007-12-30T09:52Z,"no i didnt and I wont until it is fully seeded
and as far as upping these elsewhere go right on ahead but it is not neccessary to give me credit."
,DARXYD3,2007-12-30T10:51Z,"Shitty.


He stopped uploading.  Look elswhere.  This guy obviously doesn't know how to support his own torrents."
,shadowworks,2007-12-30T11:01Z,"ty, still downloading"
,cucillo,2007-12-30T11:21Z,"dont listen to that idiot DARYXD3...I have never quit seeding this. I was just upping the machida fight at the same time and that was eating up all my bandwidth....now that it is fully seeded I have dedicated all my upload to this torrent. 
Some people's children I tell ya."
,Dankouver,2007-12-30T11:33Z,"LOL I hear ya.

 Thanks for this!"
,DARXYD3,2007-12-30T11:53Z,"Funny, cause my client says ""Seeds - 0/1""

Meanwhile there's over 900 peers.


Slacker."
,cucillo,2007-12-30T12:30Z,and that idiot says I dont know how to manage my torrents....that 0/1 means out of the 1 seeds that exist....you are connected to 0 of them dumbass. 
,1135rt,2007-12-30T16:06Z,Great way to upload the fights Cucillo many thanks from me and hot damn what a fight.
,HaVoK308,2007-12-30T21:31Z,"First to the moron who is complaining...if you dont like what you see then buy the fucking fight nex time you cheap basterd. Cucillo thanks for uploading the fights man, I greatly appreciate it as Comcrap had a lot of issues getting the fight on last night. UFC is one of the PPVs I actually buy all the time and was extremely pissed last night at comcast.

I just watched this fight and it was great as I expected it would be. Any chance you will upload the Matt and GSP fight by tonight? Thanks again!"
,HaVoK308,2007-12-30T21:36Z,Oh and btw I was getting both fights around 300 so Id say he manages them just fine. 
,gabriel84,2007-12-31T00:15Z,thank you! wanderlei should have won though! hunf!
,HaVoK308,2007-12-31T00:42Z,"""wanderlei should have won though!""

I hope you mean you wish he should have won, because he got owned by Chuck. Easy decision. If you think different you must be from Brazil or dont watch too much MMA. :-)"
,knotthed,2007-12-31T18:31Z,"props to cucillo. i dl'ed this in about 12 minutes yesterday. no speed problem here. am still uploading. will let this run for the next week or so to give all a chance to get it. by the way, was a great fight no matter who you like."
,muzzikboy,2007-12-31T20:28Z,"Hey man thanks a lot for this, I saw the fight but love to see it again, both unreal fighters and I do get a laugh from people that say ""this guy or that guy should have won"" I mean come on, this is the UFC and anything can happen, plus, it's a chess match in there as well and it takes more that a great fighter to win right? Anyway thanks again and as soon as I figure out what I'm doing I will be contributing. If anyone has some advice that can help me learn how to make a torrent, that would be awesome!!"
,slippery1,2008-01-01T04:28Z,"SPOILER ABOVE ^^^^^


don't know why you all have to spoil it every fkn time ..  dont you realize people haven't seen this yet and you're talking about who won??? "
,Raggamagga,2008-01-03T02:18Z,"Well, now when it's already spoiled.... ""Chuck the iceman Lidell is back""? Two fighter that both have seen their better days... they don't stand a chance against the top light heavyweight fighters today. Feels kind of sad to see this fight, I've admired both these fighters, especially Wand, but to see them loose fight after fight.... sad"
,aroni,2008-01-09T21:17Z,"hey i'll tell u what these guys would not get owned by any of the light heavy weights today thats the dumbest shit i ever up until 6 months ago who was the champ? The Iceman who got beat in a fight in which big John jumped the gun and has since retired while never reffing a main event fight. Chuck liddell had won more title defenses than any light heavyweight and will come back to beat ""Roids Rampage Jackson"" who as we all know was twice owned by the man Chuck beat the brakes off of the other night. I myself fight light heavyweight and the one man i would fear to be out there with is ""The Iceman."" So take that wouldn't stand a chance shit elsewhere."
,theFuzz,2008-01-14T17:12Z,thx!!great match!
