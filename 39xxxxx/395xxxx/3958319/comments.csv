,Symq,2008-10-04T14:43Z,Uhm is there any one who can seed becouse me and some other guy's are stuck at 96.5% for weeks
,swamiolsson,2008-10-07T12:32Z,"Hello, out there. This is surely a great torrent, but please seed a little more. We are quite a few who are stranded at 96,5 % - for weeks now. If somebody will seed for just a few hours, one of us can complete the download and seed for the rest. Pleaze ..."
,swamiolsson,2008-10-13T22:51Z,"Well, here we are. I'm stranded at 99,6% after several weeks. I find no way to contact *kurtz* to ask him to seed for an hour. I can see, that others are downloading from my store of the file, but it will not end ..
Seed, Pleaze ..."
,swamiolsson,2008-10-15T10:33Z,"10 MB missing for three of us! What a piece of bad luck, after all this time spent on trying to download this file. I guess, we'll have to give up on this one, fellaz, *kurtz* has gone on a long vacation ... "
,arias-ru,2009-02-17T20:33Z,Please re-seed
,Unknown_Error,2012-03-18T17:09Z,"i just started this torrent and my d/l speed is 277 B/s. yea that's right BYTES per second, not kilobytes per second. you bitches cry about being stuck and needing seeds but you won't let others d/l from you at a respectable speed.
