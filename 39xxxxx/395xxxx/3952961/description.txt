Constructed and produced by B. Lustmord with many of the sounds on "Trans Plutonian Transmissions" derived from cosmological activity as recorded by NASA's deep space network.

A hard to find CD: this is the highest bitrate (192) and best cover art I could locate. Fully ID tagged with artwork. If I ever find the actual CD, i'll make a flac torrent available.

Great space music from Lustmord recording as Arecibo.
