,to_rent ,2008-01-08T14:33Z,GREAT GAMES ..THANKS 4 THE UPPLOAD :D  
,margatenj,2008-01-12T07:58Z,thank you petersonic
,maakilpikonna,2008-01-21T15:18Z,is these fullversions?
,petersonic,2008-01-21T21:10Z,"@maakilpikonna
yes"
,vacuuum,2008-01-30T23:43Z,"Why'd you put all the games into one installer?
What if people do not want to install all the games in this compilation?"
,petersonic,2008-01-31T00:35Z,"@vacuuum

copy folder-games you like from ""C:\Program Files\PC-home\Games by Petersonic"" to desktop,usb... and run this game. For eksempel: ""bejeweled 2 deluxe"" run ""WinBej2.exe"" You can uninstall ""21 PopCap Games [Petersonic]"" from ""Control Panel-add or remove programs"""
,nelson1bls,2008-01-31T09:45Z,great upload ty all games work excelent!!!!
,petersonic,2008-02-03T21:17Z,"Install the game to whichever folder you like. Once you install it you generally won't be needing the installation executable. All you need is the folder to which you've previously installed the games. You can copy/move the folder to wherever you like, whether it's another partirion, or a USB, and still run the games. To uninstall the games, just do it regularly through ""add or remove programs"" in the controll panel. The reason that i've packed all the games within a single executable file is that I wanted to make it easier for a few ""dummies"", that may want to download it. :)

The ""setup"" files are standard for all my games."
,LukeyPoo,2008-02-03T21:49Z,Great idea- works perfectly and OK download speed- thank you!
,iskkan,2008-02-08T17:25Z,please seed. thank you.
,zuta07,2008-02-19T21:10Z,thanks a lot
,2em8uO,2008-03-20T17:52Z,"Some of the games are not working... get this message on some:

""Unable to extract game executable.""

Typershark is one of them!  Is there a reason for this?"
,covenant69,2008-03-23T09:25Z,"If you have the unable to extract executable error, and are on Vista, set to xp sp2 compatability and run as administrator. Works, though I'm not sure which one fixed it."
,RoverSonjassonn,2008-03-30T05:54Z,"RIP 3 is not in the torrent. You may consider editing it out of the list, and perhaps uploading it separately."
,abdam,2008-04-25T09:46Z,Seed plz
,abdam,2008-04-25T09:49Z,Seed now!!!
,jurraffe,2008-05-12T20:43Z,"fantastic, all working so far, thx!"
,screamo1337,2008-06-21T07:55Z,So all these are unlocked? No time limits? all cracks?
,Whatlinslayer,2008-06-21T19:38Z,The application contains a dropper agent..
,theunforgettablefire,2008-07-05T04:11Z,"will any/all work with Vista?
i can't get a Peggle torrent to work with it
thanks"
,WhalePyrate,2008-11-04T06:14Z,"WARNING WARNING
     Do not download!!!!!!!!, I will try to install under C:/ProgamFiles/PC-HOME/, Then it will play hell with your computer, If you click on a game it will stop everything then abnormal shutdown, When it does recover it takes longer then normal to reload, Then does it all over again.,"
,dasnyvon21,2008-11-04T14:48Z,really!!!
,brraXtonn,2008-11-05T02:57Z,i want your babies
,petersonic,2008-12-01T21:24Z,"@WhalePyrate
shut up!!!!!"
,DUOkey,2008-12-07T07:44Z,amazing. thank you!
,torrent97,2009-01-30T02:29Z,"Awesomeness, ill seed for a while."
,torrent97,2009-01-30T02:59Z,"awesome, ill seed.
no viruses btw."
,DDLB,2009-02-08T09:57Z,"1 exe-file?
Perhaps no viruses but NOD32 mentions a ""damaged archive""... this is all al little bit too suspicious...
Next time be a pro and use archives.
This allows users to choose the game they want."
,ghelmz2000,2009-02-25T04:10Z,"kaspersky antivirus detect trojan dropper, hidden risk to your computer. don't download"
,SAM.BURNS.RED,2009-04-09T04:25Z,"these games won't open:

feeding frenzy 2
hammer heads deluxe
iggle pop deluxe
pizza frenzy
talismania deluxe
typer shark deluxe
zuma deluxe

a popup appears and reads:
""fatal error: unable to extract game executable.""


that blows, alot.
but i guess it's still worth downloading the rest of the games."
,qqmr,2009-06-08T00:26Z,"Great Games
Thx for share...

i'm waiting for version 2"
,kidaware,2009-06-13T22:32Z,"this blows.  why not make individual rar archive for each game instead of making one .exe?

i give you -1 quality.  also, delphi blows use c++ or c# instead of some ancient shit like delphi."
,bentrom,2009-07-06T05:16Z,"Thanks a bunch this is very nice and well made. I personally like the single installer, much quicker and easier for me :)"
,themoodude,2009-07-10T02:48Z,"Don't want to sound off, but I'm not prepared to trust a single exe for a 21 game set; I only actually want 2 of those games. Next time use individual installers dude- that way people can pick and chose, and will be more trusting."
,petersonic,2009-07-10T22:37Z,"@themoodude

Install the game (single exe) to whichever folder you like. Once you install it you generally won't be needing the installation executable. All you need is the folder to which you've previously installed the games. You can copy/move the folder to wherever you like, whether it's another partirion, or a USB, and still run the games. To uninstall the games, just do it regularly through ""add or remove programs"" in the controll panel.

,Kraf_dinner,2009-11-18T12:31Z,wher is rip 3? what the fock??
,shaneybobo,2009-11-23T06:54Z,"The following games didn't work:
Hammer Heads Deluxe, Iggle Pop, Pizza Frenzy, Rocket Mania, Talismania, Typer Shark, and Zuma"
,runner3000,2009-12-13T23:11Z,works good. really easy to install. no malware. but i didnt really like the games 
,scripghost,2010-05-02T08:58Z,"Great Upload, and all you whiners out there should grow up or stop downloading from torrents."
,trippay,2010-08-06T11:20Z,"looks dodgy but i can confirm this is a clean torrent, scanned with 3 different AV's.  thanks petersonic."
,arcticgolem,2011-01-30T03:16Z,good download peter. all games work as they should. easy install.
