This is a clean unmodified Microsoft Windows Vista x64 image (Windows Vista x64 EN-US.nrg).
Are also included on this pack, some goodies*, like:

[Product][Serial/Crack]

- Skype

- Windows Live Messenger 9 BETA
- VLC Player

+++ NOD32, KIS 8, QuickTime, PowerArchiver 2007 and Nero 8 have serial/crack included. +++

*: These goodies are on the torrent, but you can choose between downloading them or not. They're not integrated into Windows Vista x64 installation. You choose what you want. ;)

**: As said above, they aren't integrated with Windows Vista. I don't recommend to you install both antivirus on same operational system, but use at your own risk.
(If you choose installing two or more antivirus engines, so make sure that only ONE RTP is running on system. ::: RTP = Real Time Protection.)

***: About Kaspersky's license. The BETA license included in the folder would be valid just until January/2008. That doesn't means the license will certainly expires after. 0:)
On NOD32 I recommend you using the trial installer (included), leaving the update params as they are show. Then, just after install, apply NOD32 FiX. This should works. ;)




+ Windows Vista x64's NRG Image rip  by Me.
+ Goodies download and organize      by Me.
+ Notes and Instructions             by Me.
+ WGA Functional Crack               Not by Me. :)


Note: I really don't remember who made this WGA Crack for Windows Vista x64. If you know who did, comment it on the torrent and I should atualize it ASAP. :)

Also, a good number of antivirus engines would flag the WGA crack as INFECTED FILE. As far as I know, there are no viruses contained on this file. You would think "Huh, but that's certainly a Trojan Horse or kind of hidden and encrypted into the file! Dummy!". I monitored the network traffic for few days, checked up with various AV engines and everything I got was a healthy system. And in fact, I got Genuine Windows. :)
