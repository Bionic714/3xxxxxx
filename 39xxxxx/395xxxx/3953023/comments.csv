,liljim,2008-01-02T03:15Z,"i got 5.2% overnight, no seeds. I'd be more than happy to seed this if i could get it myself!!"
,ThunderHawk,2008-01-02T18:53Z,Eftersom du inte kan förstå hur man seedar så MÅSTE detta vara en skit version av Vista!

,Horrorhouse,2008-03-09T17:20Z,"Yup if anyone can ( which I know you guys can ) when you get done downloading this leave it up in your torrent client that lets it seed letting other people connect and download it, i'm at 61% right now and no sign so if someone can go for man i would appreciate it."
,NightmareMinds,2008-04-08T20:01Z,"Well, sorry for the long off-time.

I was very busy and got a lot of issues with my ISP. Just recently I've been back to torrent business.

I'll do the possible to keep the machine on until there are some more seeders on this. (I can't left the PC online 24/7 uninterruptedly.)

This torrent is alive once again.
You may start downloading now. :)

------------------

@ir0nw0lf

So far as I know, this is Retail with OEM bootloader. (Bootloader not included into installation, that's the so famous crack. - This is what makes the system run Genuine.)

@liljim

Yea, some AV engines seems to recognize the fix as a trojan. I don't know for sure about this fix. Actually, every single NOD32 v3 fix I found was really weird. They all got the same issue (the nodlogin function seems to don't work as the tutorial says) and they all got caught by AV engines as trojans.

I used that so far and got no problems for months. The only thing I can't explain with sure was nodkrnl.exe taking lots of CPU sometimes. But I think that's was becoz I left deep-heuristics  on and the RTP was just doing it's job. - Very very strange, but I can't assure that it's a issue caused by this fix or not.

@Horrorhouse

Yep, I'm back to business. Let's seed this damn thing. :)

------------------

The only files on this torrent that maybe detected by AV's as trojans/virus are the NOD32 FiX and (less probably) the Vista Crack. All other files were full scanned with NOD32 v3 and Kaspersky 7/8 and got nothing at all.

Have fun folks! :D"
,NightmareMinds,2008-04-08T20:04Z,"Mistaken:

*ekrnl.exe

That's not nodkrnl.exe, that's ekrnl.exe The kernel function of NOD32 v3. :)

Just as a warning: Unloading this process may cause NOD32 to don't work. Initializing system w/o him will cause a ""Kernel communication failure"" on attempt to run NOD32."
,NightmareMinds,2008-04-08T20:26Z,"Seems that imageshack removed the system dialog screenshot that used to show ""Windows Activated"".

Here's an second link: http://skileta.caucasus.net/uploaded/3ed7a3d2205f09987a15e9ecd4d8098f.jpg

Have fun and keep seeding folks! :)"
,XweAponX,2008-07-17T22:56Z,"HUGE thanx for the, eh, ""Goodies"" some GOOD stuff there, (some bad stuff is there too)

Is this torrent fully seeded or nicht?

NM-Minds: Eset NOD32 version 3.x pretty much SUCKS seeing has how they totally AlTERED the fucktioning of the program:

1) AMON and IMON are totally trashed
2) The SCANNER has been TRASHED. You CAN NOT set it up to autoimatically deal with what it finds, like you can do with version 2.7

Version 2.5 was good, until the update server sends the force-update command. I prefer version 2.7 - Using the NOD32Fix version 2.2 which gives a so far irrevocable 1.5 million days and the only hitch is that you have to restore the *.reg crack which gets deleted by a scan of the Program files\Eset folder chain.

I have been using 2.7 since it came out and I avoid versions 3.x at all costs. It is BLOATED like NORTONMCAFEE."
,NightmareMinds,2008-08-04T23:41Z,"Yeah, some time after posting this I realized that what you've said is nothing but true.

Since 3.x they fck** NOD32. I have dropped it out, long ago. It WAS fully seeded. I seeded myself 24/7 for something like a whole month.

But then I've formatted the PC again but couldn't make the backup, so I've lost it up. And as I saw no more comments on this torrent (until now.) I just left it the way it was.

If requested, I could make again another ""release"" of this torrent, clean as it is, with no trash streamed into the installation, but with the ""Goodies"" available for more comfortable using. :)

And maybe, I could slipstream the SP1 already, so it would make a bit easier to people.


All I need is someone (at least, 1 person.) requesting it. :D"
,Kayihan92,2008-08-05T13:09Z,"Nightmare;

Man, you told if anyone(maybe just 1 person, lol :P) requests it, you would be the seed, so we could download.Actually i request and need it man..Please get On! :)"
,IronBars,2008-10-27T20:28Z,I request it.....seed?
,mrtoad1984,2011-01-12T05:17Z,What Sevice Pack of Vista is this?  Will I be able to install Service Packs without Microsoft catching wind?
