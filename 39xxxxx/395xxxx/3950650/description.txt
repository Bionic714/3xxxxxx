Especially For Youth (often abbreviated as EFY) is a week long youth-oriented seminar focused on fellowship and teaching the principles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Attendance is open to all youth aged 14 to 18. Sessions, which are primarily held in the United States, follow a common curriculum created by the Church, resulting in a common experience wherever EFY is held. Sessions take place during the summer months in order to coincide with the summer break practiced by many American schools. The program is led by Latter-day Saint young adults who serve as counselors in exchange for a modest stipend. Speakers are selected from the Church's Institute and Seminary programs.

EFY states that its mission is to help participants "come unto Christ" by providing an environment where youth can experience physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual growth.
