,Tilrak,2008-05-11T23:03Z,Lol anyone notice the how ironic that we're pirating mormon music... just thought I'd point that out... lol and thanks for the dl!
,mel1116,2008-06-12T21:01Z,"Tilrak, while it may seem odd, consider this: It was recently found that the people most likely to steal things under $5 are mormons. It is all very interesting. 

Thanks goduke. This is pretty awesome!"
,goduke150,2008-07-11T08:10Z,"Hah! Yes, I thought of that as I was uploading it. I figure it's better for someone to download this than anything else right? Think of it as spreading the gospel in a nonconventional manner. :)

I'll keep an eye on this to make sure there are constantly seeders. Until then, I'm uploading other projects..."

,dukedoit,2008-12-07T00:12Z,I feel like downloading and sharing this music is just about as wrong as making a copy of a CD for a friend.
