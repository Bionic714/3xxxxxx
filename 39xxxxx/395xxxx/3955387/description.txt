Over the past two nights, I was carried away to Avalon and Camelot. Even though I've seen virtually every version of the Arthurian legends ever filmed, and was a bit hesitant about seeing yet another, this was a winner! Being told through the eyes of the women involved, who are generally reduced to Guinevere, Morgana (aka Morgaine), and the Lady of the Lake's arm in most tellings, made this completely an original. I must admit that I have never been a great fan of Juliana Margulies, even though I've watched ER since it first aired, but she was wonderful as Morgaine in this. Joan Allen and Anjelica Huston gave performances worthy of the Oscars they've been nominated for, and Samantha Mathis as the ill-fated Guinevere was heartbreaking. As a final note, I believe the casting director definitely merits an Emmy, since the little girl who played young Morgaine looked EXACTLY like a pre-teen version of Juliana, and Hans Matheson, who played the evil Mordred, Morgaine's son, couldn't have resembled Juliana more if she'd have really given birth to him! As an enchanting, mythological fantasy tale, I recommend it to anyone over 14, due to a slightly graphic (necessary) sexual scene dealing with incest and one of a menage a trois nature.
