To not use the update means you cant input the serial and click ok. To instal the update means the serial is difunkt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please someone give us some answers!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

,DanielDives,2008-01-02T13:26Z,"Angel,

Install soft, but don't update. Works perfect, and remember, buy the stuff you like."
,Ange1-eyes,2008-01-02T16:03Z,Tried that but the screen goes funny and it wont let me press ok when i input serial. I am running it on Vista and PS3 so any more suggestions?
,bigjohnxxx,2008-01-13T19:07Z,Enter 97-6608015353-301133267-E1201466645 for serial.  Might be a fix for you all.
,Malise,2008-02-12T23:28Z,"I installed this without the update and the serial still won't work.  I've installed this many times from multiple different scene cracks, and NONE of them work."
,glowinglobster,2009-01-23T19:21Z,"cheers bigjohn for the serial number, works great now :D"
,BarryMic,2009-02-15T22:00Z,I just reinstalled this on Vistax64 after my old XP computer died and it works. I had burned it to a disk several months ago. I just go to where I installed it (C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoFx Photographic) and click the PGE application image. I see that AutoFx Photographic Edges is now 7.0 and costs hundreds of dollars. 
,ozplayed,2009-03-31T21:42Z,I'm confused. There are like 15 of the same file and I cant unpack all of them. How am I supposed to do this? Any help would be great!!!!!

,RomeoRob,2009-06-18T07:47Z,"Please can someone give me a serial which is working ?.
Have successfully installed, and registered the program, BUT it will NOT accept the given serial (s) when I attempt to use it ?.
THANK YOU, in anticipation ?"
,foca,2009-08-22T20:21Z,"Works... sometimes. Crashes a lot in some plugins in the standalone version, some just crash when you open and the program closes. Other work just fine. Vista 64, CS3.

Didn't bother to try the plugin version of the faulty ones yet, probably will crash too.

It's not much worth all the fuss."
,distill,2009-11-20T15:37Z,"Yes, did not work at all. Probably better to just get a bunch of good brushes and do the work manually."
,hitman564,2009-12-16T13:32Z,Its asking for serial plz somebody have any idea??????
,TazzyUK,2010-02-14T19:59Z,Update caused mine to crash all the time so reinstalled without update and works a treat :-)
