,hugoleandro,2009-05-30T13:52Z,"FRIENDBLASTER PRO v10.4.7 (Last Version)

Because there is not a solution for this program anymore to work again with patch or crack, I buyed the last version because I could not wait for a crack (if there will be one) and I needed it with urgency to promote a festival. In 3 days i won't need it anymore, it is the unlimited version. If there is someone here interested, just send me an email to hugofrlima(@)hotmail(.)com , I only ask you to share the loss I had (59$ +- 44eur), i don't know how much, it is up to you and the importance the program have to you, like from 5 eur... i just ask you to be on my place and understand. I searched for someone on internet asking to share the program but I didn't found so, I had to buy and now I am asking to share the costs :) - UNLIMITED VERSION. ONLY CONTACT ME IF IT WILL BE FOR RESPONSIBLE USE. I don't want to have problems with the owners of the program if you are going to use it for spam.It is my name the the program is regiestered on and my name on the paypal bill... so, only contact if you are not a spammer, and not a bad person :)

Just send me an email. I have the 10.4.7 version right now but I can download all the updates with no problem because it is a registered program.

Cheers.

(and people, before judging me, be on my place, i had to buy it, I could't wait for a crack -if, there will be a crack - so now, I just want to recover a part of my loss)"
