You are an idiot...Watchable, maybe - in my opinion it isnt...nor is any cam recording (don't get me wrong as far as cam goes this is good) but this is a friggin cam recording...You think that it is recorded in dobly digital surround sound (10/10 audio) or dvd quality (9/10 video - based on the size, not likely unless the movie is only 30 minutes)"
,altaEGO,2008-01-04T15:44Z,maybe he meant audio and video quality as far as CAMS go..... just a thought...
