,zeinabqureshi,2008-02-26T07:53Z,"Thanks a lot... I myself came across this film (a reference to it) from Theodore Adorno (philsopher). I loved the film, amazed to see how few Schlondorff films are actually there on BitTorrent. For someonw like Wenders, we always have 10-12 torrents live all the time...
Thanks for the comment, thank you for seeding it..."
,Laffitoff,2008-03-11T14:16Z,"Nice work zeinabquereshi, great film and a quality d/l.
thx for sharing!!"
,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-14T16:27Z,"Thanks for the comment, *laffitoff*... in case you're looking for another film by Schlondorff, here's the link:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4040164/Death_of_a_Salesman_(1985)

It does not show up in a search for Schlondorff, because the uploader forgot to mention the director's name! It's a good film I suppose..."
,Laffitoff,2008-03-22T18:30Z,"Hi zeinabqureshi,
Thanks for the info. Have also tried finding 'The Morals of Ruth Halbfass ' which was recommended to me some years ago but I've never come across this in any form.
many thanks for your quality work!"
,zeinabqureshi,2008-11-16T12:47Z,"@Laffitoff:
Sorry for being this late...but Ruth Halbfass is nowhere to be found, searched everywhere including the DVD shops. Will put it up once I lay my hands on it...not sure if it ever had a DVD release, though."
,faisalkidwai,2009-03-20T22:47Z,"Zeinab, I always thought I was crazy about films but you are in a different league all together. The depth and breadth of movies you have seen is simply amazing. You would do great as a film critic.
P.S. I am posting this message on other movie boards because I do not know which one you would read."
,zeinabqureshi,2009-03-27T15:06Z,"Faisal,
(I have replied to your comment on my latest torrent as well) Thanks for your comment...

This was my first upload. I was meaning to plug some stops in the incredible collection of Criterion movies available in the trackers (I guess we have more than 415 of the 450-odd Criterion titles available, somewhere). I came by some good movies, watched some of them, and posted those which weren't available elsewhere. 

Thanks for taking the time for noting...and you were pretty quick with the comments on all my posts...! "
,pirata00,2009-05-28T20:17Z,"amazing zeinabqureshi!
great selection.
refreshing to find real cinema around here.
thanks very much, from Brasil."
,zeinabqureshi,2009-08-03T12:48Z,"@pirata00: ~
Thanks for downloading. Well, this was the movie which made me upload a few torrents. 
By the by, you have a nice nickname (pirata00). 
:-;
Do check back occasionally...you can find almost all of the Criterion releases some place or else, but I'll be posting here.
Cheers, and happy viewing!"
,wasifhaze,2009-10-03T18:31Z,"Thank you Zainab Qureshi, great upload, also from 2 weeks piratebay seems to be an offline tracker in India and Pakistan so please add http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce
udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce
in the tracker list. Some, who are getting problems in downloading piratebay torrents can also use that tracker"
,zeinabqureshi,2009-12-08T08:04Z,"@wasifhaze:
tpb is trying to switch eventually to magnet links and DHT...the idea is to make this site work or trackerless torrents. I guess they'd continue to support trackers for a year or so, but all over the world, including ""safe havens"" such as Holland, torrent sites have taken a beating...so make hay while the sun shines, get all you can. Regards. 

I'm not from Pakistan, but my love and my best regards."
