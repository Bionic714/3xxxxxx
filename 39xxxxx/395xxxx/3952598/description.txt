Synopsis (taken from Wikipedia.org)
---------------------------------------
Young Torless (German: Der junge Torless) is a 1966 German film directed by 
Volker Schlondorff, adapted from the autobiographical novel The Confusions of Young Torless by Robert Musil. It deals with the sadistic and homoerotic tendencies of a group of boys at an Austrian military academy at the beginning of the 20th century.

When Thomas Torless (Mathieu Carriere) arrives at the academy, his interest is soon piqued by the apparently homosexual Anselm von Basini (Marian Seidowsky), who, after having been caught stealing by fellow student Reiting (Fred Dietz), becomes Reiting's "slave," bowing to Reiting's sadistic rituals. Torless follows their relationship with intellectual interest but without emotional involvement.

Also partaking in these sessions is Beineberg (Bernd Tischer), with whom Torless visits Bozena (Barbara Steele), the local prostitute. Again, Torless is aloof and more intrigued than excited by the woman.

When Basini and Torless are left alone in the academy, Torless sleeps with Basini, though he later decides it was just an experiment.

After Basini is nearly lynched by a mob because of one of Reiting's intrigues, Torless, having completed the transition from youth to adult, takes his life in his own hands for the first time and leaves the academy.

(Note)----------------------------------------------------------
This was the first film by Volker Schlondorff. It won a prize at the Cannes film festival in 1966, and catapulted the director into the ranks of the world's significant film directors. It is also considered the first film of the German New Wave.
