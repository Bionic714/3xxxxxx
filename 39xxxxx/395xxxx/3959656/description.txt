From the Publisher

a #1 New York Times bestseller.

A classic american crime novel.

An offer you can\\\'t refuse...

Since its first publication in 1969, Mario Puzo\\\'s epic The Godfather has earned a permanent place in the American psyche and culture. In this story of family, loyalty, and the men who rule the American underworld, Puzo introduced a cast of singularly crafted characters, and offered an unforgettable look into the world of organized crime no writer has been able to duplicate since.


Puzo\\\'s story details the rise of Don Vito Corleone, the fall of his sons Sonny and, especially, Michael, the Mafia\\\'s peculiar behavior code and honor system, and the violent power struggle among rival \\\"families.\\\" To some reviewers, Puzo\\\'s tale is a symbolic treatment of the corruption of the American dream. Although not all critics view the novel so seriously, most agree with Polly Anderson in the Library Journal that \\\"the book is well written, suspenseful and explodes in a series of dramatic climaxes.\\\" Newsweek\\\'s Pete Axthelm calls Puzo \\\"an extremely talented storyteller\\\" and states that The Godfather \\\"moves at breakneck speed without ever losing its balance.\\\" And a critic for the Saturday Review contends that \\\"Mario Puzo has achieved the definitive novel about a sinister fraternity of crime.\\\"
