Full Manga Entertainment Video DVD ISO rip with original DVD menues and anime previews. 

The first film directed by legendary Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki who's directed other films such as 'Howl's Moving Castle', 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke'. I thought I would post this as the DVD doesn't seem widely available. I first got it from a library and later tried to rent it, but it took me a while to find it. I'm not that familiar with Lupin the Third, but according to message boards, this is one of the better (if not the best) Lupin movies.

Plot Outline:
Reknowned international thief Lupin III (known as "Wolf" in the English dub) comes to the small European duchy of Cagliostro to investigate some excellently-forged money and stumbles across a national conspiracy going back some hundreds of years. Lupin and his friends must rescue the beautiful Clarice from the hands of the evil Count Cagliostro and solve the mystery of a hidden treasure dating back to the 15th century.
