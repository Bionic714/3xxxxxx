Avast Professional v4.7.1098 + key maker 






DVT has released new version of Avast Professional. Professional version is mainly created for corporate or business users. There is no such a big difference between this Pro and Home Edition (which is available as a freeware copy; You get a legit serial number). I?m a user of Home Edition almost a year now, and i can say i?m happy with it. It doesn?t go crazy when it comes to scene keygens, cracks, patchs (like AVG for example) and most important, it?s not a (big) resource hog. Here is comparison table, so it?s up to you to decide will you go for freeware (Home) edition, keygenned (Pro) edition, or some other antivir; after all it?s personal choice?
