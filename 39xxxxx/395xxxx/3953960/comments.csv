,ac0de,2008-01-02T11:52Z,What about uploading macos 10.5.1? Did you follow a guide to make this?
,jrp7591,2008-01-08T22:15Z,Is there a SuperUser password with this VM Machine or did I just miss it during the install? Can't install VMWare Tools unless logged in as su.
,Foefke,2008-01-19T13:13Z,"Hey, how to solve the installation problems of vmware tools?
KLDSTAT etc.
Without vmware tools it's so sluggish - it's almost impossible to work with it."
,ximo88,2008-01-30T18:27Z,It's possible to get wired using a wifi connection?
,155bpmikey,2008-02-08T12:31Z,doesn't work for me. i have an AMD processor and i'm running ubuntu linux 7.10 with vm6
,155bpmikey,2008-02-08T12:51Z,error message - The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. You will need to power off or reset the virtual machine at this point.

,sunbear,2008-02-10T05:14Z,"I have downloaded this package twice, and both times the .rar archive is corrupt.  Any ideas?"
,tookay,2008-02-12T01:05Z,"Hello, i don't see anywhere to change the SuperUser password. Anybody got it plz cause i need it to install VMWare Tools.
Thanks."
,tookay,2008-02-12T14:53Z,"to change the root password, go to Netinfo manager in application folders, choose Security in the FinderBar and disable the root user. then enable it, it will ask for a new password.
TADA!"
,mroblivious1bmf,2008-02-15T07:09Z,"Does not work and i have a pretty highend computer. [amd, also]

the vm crashes during bootup.

do not download"
,gzez,2008-02-18T05:55Z,"mroblivious1bmf: what are you talking about, it works just fine. Get some knowledge before you write stupid comments you have no clue about"
,MystikIncarnate,2008-02-18T22:09Z,"this download is GOOD!

i actually specificly came back to say that. i'm using VMWare workstation 6 in linux, and the appliance loaded and booted fine (a little slow, but fine), network works, sound works (though it doesn't sound very good).  RAR seems to have been made in Windows, WinRAR had no problem decompressing it, but Archive Manager under Ubuntu 7.10 couldn't even open the RAR file.

YES! this images is slow, NO! there are no vmware tools. if you're very ambitious, you can compile the BSD VMWare tools under OS X and likely get them to work, however, this is unlikely.

I use OS X for testing only, and this image works great. helps me assist in troubleshooting Apple computers over the phone and gives me a good general idea of the workings of the operating system."
,nick-napster,2008-02-19T20:28Z,"this is amazing!
but the fullscreen is note full???
it is black in the sides??

is it possible to fix?"
,jennifer1994,2008-03-01T22:42Z,"This torrent signals a dawn of a new Era!

I'm running Vista Ultimate with 2.8 gigs of dreamscenes that change every day. In a window is the Mac OS. Its the freakin dynamic duo, each OS using a core or two, depending on my mood. Get the ""choose your poison"" wallpaper for the mac. The dreamscene torrent is on supretorrents, and ge the latest monthly Vista Ultimate. but yeah the mac in a window, awesome!!!!

I'm using adobe after effects and a bunch of adobe apps on the mac, and creating my own dreams for stardock deskscapes!"
,ff8raider,2008-03-05T00:50Z,"Works perfectly on my q6600

Ty =)"
,skler000,2008-03-06T23:20Z,"This is OSX 10.4.10, works perfectly on VMWare 4.x and following, although it doesn't have VMWare Tools, so it's a little bit slow.
But if you want to take a look at mac osx it's excellent.
And DON'T UPLOAD TO 10.4.11!"
,jh3141,2008-03-14T13:06Z,"Also works OK on VMWare Server 1.0.4, although display updates are somewhat slow.  Installing a VNC server and using that rather than the VMWare console helped.  Note that memory size is set to 512MB, which may be too high for your system (depending on memory size and what else it's doing, of course).  I set it down to 360MB and everything seems to be working fine."
,cbyp1981,2008-03-28T20:01Z,"Mine says with 1.0.5
""This image was made with a version of vmware that has more features""

What does that mean? I have the latest server from vmware.com  What else do I need?"
,HMPCAMPHILL,2008-04-03T10:33Z,"Muckin Fagic! Bloody AMAZING, this guy is just.. well.. id buy him a drink! This is great, lovely addition, right at the setup screen, im running this through an oldish laptop AMD Turion 64 MK-36 with a gig of ram, it runs fine... I got vista ultimate with all effects running, ubuntu 7.10 in vmware, and This OSX running also, not a problem...

Only a note, when you bring this into VMWARE workstation 6... it asks you if you MOVED or COPIED it.. i just clicked copied and it came straight up..


Synthetix's once again your a fking STAR!

Let me know when you get leopard just like this!

Also id quite like to get it running 1280x800.....

Anyone with any clues.. just leave comment on here...

Cheers Chucky Eggs"
,Magallanes,2008-04-03T22:44Z,"Thanks for the file:


Q:it runs?
A:yes, but require ss3

Q:is it fast?
A:No, slow has hell (ok, not so slow but a lot burden).

Q: Vmware tools?
A:To the date, there are not vmware tools for osx, alternate you can check:

,RoninXI,2008-04-08T05:58Z,"This is the 4th time I have tried one of these but I keep getting the ""file is too large"" error can anyone tell me what I have to do to get these stupid things running?  I have tried VMWare server and workstation I get the same error on both.  I am sure it is a simple solution but I don't know what to look for I just got done Googling the shit for over an hour.

VMWare fusion never gives me any problems another reason to fucking hate windows."
,zhou.fei.fei,2008-04-20T13:35Z,"@RoninXI:

Are u using FAT32 as your partition where you are unzipping this vmware image? There's a single-file-size limit (of ~4gb) on FAT32 partitions"

,ripnullnet,2008-05-16T18:11Z,"After 'unrar x OSX.rar' in Linux, you will need to run 'chmod +x OSX/FreeBSD.vmx'.   I'm running Ubuntu 7.10 server i386 on Q6600 and VMware Server 1.0.4 from Canonical repository.

Once you import OSX/FreeBSD.vmx into your VMware Console's Inventory, edit the settings for CD-ROM and floppy to autodetect instead of E: and A: respectively.  You could just disconnect the floppy drive as recent Macs do not even have them anyway.

,nick-napster,2008-06-30T12:02Z,Somone who has a virtual machine of osx leopard?
,timzon,2008-07-01T01:17Z,"Dumbest question in the world, why is it asking for a license key? I thought this version was cracked before I install it. If it does need a crack, where might I get it? And if it needs a serial, will any serial do?"
,fat_rat_bastard,2008-07-14T14:48Z,"I've tried this under Workstation v6.0.4b93057 and Player 2.0.4b930587 hosted on Server 2008 64bit, and booting the vm causes the host machine to BSOD. I haven't really nailded down where in the boot process it is, but its after launchd starts processing the startup scripts. I've tried removing the floppy, optical drive, network, and sound, but it doesn't help. 

Boots fine on my TP X60 with XP SP2 32bit. Sound and networking work.

Thank you for the VM, it's great! Just wish it would work on my Server 2008 system."

,BLuNTeD,2008-11-23T03:31Z,"I dunno why people bother with these virtual machines when you can quite easily dual/triple boot into Vista/OSX Leopard, and ubuntu all from one PC, I have my machine setup with 4 different drives, one with my Vista installation and all my games, another with Leopard 10.5.5, and another with the latest Ubuntu... I don't get these virtual machine things at all and don't see the point in them?

The current system I am running now is a lot faster than my own core 2 duo 2,17ghz 17"" iMac, my system is an Athlon 4200+X2 Dual core o/ced to 2.8ghz, nd 4GB of DDR2 800mhz RAM o/ced to 950mhz and it is completely stable, I have an asus M2N4 SLI mobo, and a Gefore 8800GX 768mb video card, and it flies with all three OSes.... 

If these VMware versions of OSX are slow then why dont you just install OSX86 (one of the many distro's I suggest Kalyway 10.5.2 for the easiest installation) and see how well it performs on your system, getting the drivers to work is simple enough if you know which kexts to look for...."
,filecore,2008-12-12T13:41Z,"Installed perfectly for me and is useable apart from no network connection, but I haven't figured out yet if that's to do with the VM or not. Otherwise it works as advertised, no problems. It's a bit slow and can lag when executing commands but that's hardly surprising and not the fault of the download since I'm running it in a VM on a box with these specs: Pentium 4 2.8GHz, 2GB (4x512) PC2700, nVidia 7600GS."

It then logs other illegal instructions and goes into an endless loop of abnormal console exits.

Any one gotten around this? Any clues appreciated."

,phresh1,2009-08-23T08:40Z,would this work on a 32bit?
,Drowlord,2009-09-23T00:49Z,"This works fine under 32-bit windows (in my case XP), but it requires a certain level of processor to run.  My Celeron 1.6ghz laptop won't run this, but my Core2Duo 2.4ghz laptop will run it just fine.  (both using the same image and both running the same version of VMWare Player).  It isn't zippy on my Core2Duo, so it would probably be unusable on an older single-core processor, anyway."
