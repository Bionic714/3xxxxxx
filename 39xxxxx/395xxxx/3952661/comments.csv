,kylefsu32,2007-12-29T23:42Z,"oh yeah, this is a really good movie, not as good as the first, but still a really good movie!"
,mike123,2007-12-30T07:18Z,"Hey, yeah! It does work! But not as you described. When I pressed the F6 key, a gorgeous blonde jumped through my monitor and rubbed her tits in my face, then she sucked me dry!
After that, she hit my pet hamster on the head with a hammer and stole my car. 
Fuck you!"
