,Itachi42,2008-01-03T14:29Z,how do I use addons on oblivon do I need to download the addnons on piratebay or can I get the 1 from the addons site? and how do I make them work then?
,Gero76,2008-01-03T20:11Z,"All Oblivion's addons works only with original game. In this pack all official addons were already included in game-cd image. Instructions for unofficial mods are in the folders with them (unpack RARarchive file named Oblivion Mod Collection). In most cases you need only to place files from mod's folder to folder of installed game which named DATA. Then in Oblivion Launcher (at the game start) choos? Data Files tab and mark the name of installed mod with tick. Then launch the game and enjoy :) By the way, almoust all mods in my collection are not localized - you can take pleasure with English language in it :)"
,rabbitkicker,2008-01-03T20:15Z,is this game in English?

,Gero76,2008-01-04T11:15Z,"metal_head81 :)))))))))

Actually, I somewhere saw the .esp file to translate game back on the English - but how is it working I don't know. In russian localisation was translated all texts and textures, books, etc.
I don't know would this .esp return all in an initial condition."
