This is the first album from promising italian guitarist, bassist, singer, one-man-band Simmessa. It's mainly a guitar record, but with diverse influences and a bizarre feeling to the music. There are 6 original songs and two more songs which are covers of long gone eighties classics such as the original "The Bold and the Beautiful" intro theme - "High Upon This Love" by Jack Allocco and David Kurtz, together with a fresh interpretation of the Super Mario Bros theme (by Koji Kondo), completely executed on the electric bass.
