This movie was really hard to find so if you download it, make sure you seed for other people!!

enjoy"

,CompuTerror,2008-06-09T08:59Z,"Thank you so much!!! I've been searching for this for ages!
Might I ask if you could upload the full DVD?"
,budinsky,2008-06-12T10:36Z,I use ConvertXToDVD to make it a DVD and I have not uploaded it as a DVD because the file size would be far too large for download.
,CompuTerror,2008-06-16T16:23Z,"But even if it's over 4,45gb on DVD it can be compressed to that format. I want the fully featured DVD with menus etc."
,ragesRemorse,2008-11-03T02:36Z,"thanks, i havent seen this movie since i was a kid "
,no_limit2,2010-10-07T08:06Z,"wow im surprised that this movie doesnt have any more seeders. i will seed for as long as i can but with a 50kbps max upload speed i dunno how much good i will do, BUT its all i can do so i guess im helping :)"
