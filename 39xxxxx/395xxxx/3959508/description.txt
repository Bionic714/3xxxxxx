Coeida is a great addition to Masakatsu's collection of works. It perfectly encapsulates all of the positivity associated with the spring and summer seasons. In this regard, it's more reminiscent of the the more rhythmic Eating and Eating 2 releases than it is of his more experimental and atonal Pia and Opus Pia albums. The album has songs that are sometimes mostly piano-based and even one featuring David Sylvian (on "Exit/Delete"). Even though Masakatsu's aural works are mostly concentrated within the realm of electronic music, it's an album that's more contingent on the listener's mood than their genre preference.
