Saddam Hussein: America's Best Enemy 
	
  When a unit of the 4th infantry division of the American army 
captured Saddam Hussein on December 13, 2003, they finally put an end 
to the ambiguous 40-year relationship between the iron man of Bagdad 
and the US. Ever since his rise to power in a coup d'etat on 
February 8, 1963, Saddam Hussein had marked the destiny of Iraq and 
that of the most explosive region in the world: the Persian Gulf. Yet 
this man and his country have remained an enigma for the nine 
successive presidents who have occupied the White House over the same 
period. He has also represented a constant challenge for the CIA, 
which, having supported his rise to power, didn't know how to, nor 
were they able to, get rid of him. Saddam Hussein: America's Best 
Enemy tells the story of this ambiguous relationship, through accounts
given by those who were witness to and participants in those decades 
of violence.
