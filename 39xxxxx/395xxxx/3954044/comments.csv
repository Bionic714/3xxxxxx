,st341th,2008-01-03T18:18Z,"PC-Cillin has now been replaced with Trend Micro Internet Security, if you would like this instead just ask.

The last version of PC-Cillin can be downloaded from here http://www.trendmicro.com/ftp/products/tis/TIS153SENGB.exe

We will not release a crack as its old software."
,darkdiver1,2008-01-03T19:08Z,yes please mate.
,st341th,2008-01-03T21:23Z,We are working on your request.
,st341th,2008-01-03T22:29Z,Trend Micro Internet Security 2008 has already been released by another group. Thus we shall not re-release it.
,blazer68,2008-01-05T06:02Z,I have NOD32 installed can you tell me if this firewall is compatible with it ?
,st341th,2008-01-05T17:28Z,No reason for any firewall not to be compatible with it?
,Gastromix,2008-01-09T23:18Z,I have tried other firewalls and some of them werent compatible with nod32 like Kerio WinRoute Firewall is not compatible with nod32 if you dont shutt down some functions in it so i think blazer68 is right in asking.
