,Franklint,2008-06-17T09:42Z,"Oh my God. You should learn what you're talking about before shooting your mouth off. While this film has also been released as ""Vampire Effect"", it is perfectly accurate to list it as ""The Twins Effect"", as this is the title under which it was released elsewhere.

Also, Jackie Chan does indeed make a guest appearance in the film. Perhaps you should see the film before making judgements."

Bunch of F***ing leechers configured their torrent software to download but not upload at all.
My ratio was +2.66 when I finally completed the download!

The movie wasn't even that good!"
