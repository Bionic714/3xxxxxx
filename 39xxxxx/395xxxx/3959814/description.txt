Justice League IV (2006-?)

This is the fourth era of the justice league. Once again they start over with issue #1. Do you get tired of that?
Once again the Justice League breaks up in the end (ok it hasn't happened. but it's inevitable, we just don't know when - maybe Final Crisi? Oh yea it will be the FINAL crisis. Next one will be "Catastrophe on Trans-finite Earths or something. And Bruce Wayne will stay dead if they kill him. Very few besides Gwen Stacy and Luthien Tinuveil (Tolkien) have "died indeed and left the world, and they have lost her whom they most loved." .:P

To repeat myself  - They just do this to manipulate you you know. :grrr: They want you to think "Oh wow issue #1 - collectors item!" I can get a complete run too! It's a cheap trick! Don't go along with it. Demand your local comic shop put stickers over the issue numbers! :lol:
