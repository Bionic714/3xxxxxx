The film takes place in a small Texas border town in 1980. 
Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) has ruled the land for years without 
the use of a gun, but a new brand of reckless lawlessness has taken over his town. 
Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is an innocent Everyman with a devoted wife, 
Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald), but when he stumbles across a drug deal gone 
deadly and finds two million dollars, he's determined to keep it for himself. 
There's only one problem. He's being pursued by one of the most amoral, 
evil psychopaths that the big screen has ever seen.

Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Javier Bardem.
