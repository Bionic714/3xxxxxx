  TRANQUILITY BAY

  Exotic school names like Tranquility Bay and Paradise Cove and 
beachside locations in countries like Jamaica, Fiji and Western Samoa
suggest that troubled-teen students will find an idyllic and 
understanding academic paradise where they can reform. Instead the 
pupils behind the schools' barbed wire fences have been subjected to 
abuse and half of the schools have been forced to close.

Tranquility Bay looks at the private reform-school industry for 
wayward American teens and the unhappy parents who are increasingly 
speaking ut about the practices in these institutions. It is a 
growing industry and affluent parents pay up to $25, 000 a year in 
school fees.

The World Wide Association of Specialty Programs (WWASP) is the 
leading provider of behaviour modification programs for American 
teens. At the helm of a company which earns $95 million per year is 
Robert Browning Lichfield, a Utah resident and Mormon, who has built
his fortune through the numerous WWASP programs that are located 
throughout the world. He is in charge of a virtual empire of schools
where complaints of physical and sexual abuse are allegedly ignored
by American authorities.

The school's popularity feeds on the strong level of concern that
parents have for their delinquent children. Parents attend seminars
where they are led to believe that their children can be changed for
the better and then sign contracts with WWASP which specify it is
allowed to use pepper spray, electronic disablers, mace, mechanical
restraints and handcuffs to enforce good behaviour. The contract also
states that the organisation is not liable for any harm the child
should suffer while in its care. There are also allegations that the
schools lack a comprehensive academic curriculum, operate without a
license from the education ministry and offer student qualifications
that aren't officially recognised in America.

At WWASP, punishments are of a physical nature and designed to inflict
extreme pain on the receiver. Misbehaviour such as talking at
inappropriate moments is punished by relegation to the "dog cage" - a
small boxed area where a student is forced to lie face-down for hours,
days or months, in extreme heat conditions. One female student was
subjected to this punishment for 18 months.

Foreign authorities have been sufficiently concerned with the
activities of the schools to shut down establishments in Western
Samoa, Costa Rica, Mexico and the Czech Republic. In total, six out
of twelve WWASP schools have closed amidst allegations of child abuse.
An increasing number of parents who are shocked at the physical and
emotional scars borne by their returning children have started to
speak out against WWASP, under the threat of lawsuits. The film
follows the progress of a defamation suit that WWASP brought against
single mother, Sue Scheff, who set up a website detailing her
objections to the way her son was treated in Tranquility Bay, Jamaica.

The program claims that the profitability of WWASP goes a long way to
explaining why American authorities have not mounted investigations
into its activities. An examination of personal finances of school
executives, such as Robert Browning Lichfield, indicates that they are
amongst the biggest donors to the Republican Party and gave over
$1 million in political donations in 2002-2004 and also fund the
missionary work of the Mormon movement
