,professorfuntime,2007-12-28T02:48Z,No comments? Strange. I really liked the version that had the blur stain on the bottom for the whole fucking movie. Plus no music. What was up with that. Does the theatrical release have a sound track? Does anyone know this? 
,captainjeff,2007-12-28T03:17Z,"Okay I finished the download and had a look. It's real, but the sound and quality isn't great. No blur on the bottom, but like i said quality is not great.

audio - 7/10
video - 5/10"
,Theweeeone,2007-12-28T03:34Z,Booo Coen bros dont like soundtracks. Adds to the suspense
,gylgamesh5,2007-12-28T04:25Z,The film was made without a soundtrack.
,jinx_hyperbole,2007-12-28T17:11Z,"captain jeff, could you upload a screen that justifies your 5/10 video rating?  it can't be that bad."
,lustpasswords,2007-12-29T20:17Z,"Not AVI format tho, but it is the real deal. It's a renamed MPG file. That's why you got issues playing it in different old'school slash crappy players who can't figure out how to look inside the file instead of just looking at the extension.

Always use Mplayer for a good result ;) cheers

And to the rippers, please do try to get the extensions right ;) fucks it up for us when we believe it's a avi container and then ends up with a broke file in our divx web player..."

This is the real deal for anyone who didn't see it posted"
,s41nt,2007-12-30T13:09Z,"Decent, easily watchable quality. Unless you're waiting for a DVDrip, this is what you want. Thanx jonny"
