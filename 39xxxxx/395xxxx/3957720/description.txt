_____________________________________________________________Summary__

For most of the past 16 years the truly elected leader of Burma,
Aung San Suu Kyi, has been held under house arrest by a brutal
military dictatorship that suppresses all opposition through a
policy of rape, forced labour and systematic killings. This is a
country unique in failing all five crucial tests by which the UN
measures human rights, yet until now the world has all but ignored.
Finally, the UN Security Council is beginning to debate how to deal
with this renegade nation, in which Britain is the second biggest
investor.

Journalist Evan Williams goes undercover for Dispatches deep inside
Burma on a highly dangerous journey to witness new levels of violence
by the regime against its own people.  Evan documents atrocities
committed against the Karen people, and follows up by illegally
entering Burma again - this time as a tourist.  He meets dissidents
willing to sacrifice their freedom so that people on the outside
should know what is going on.  Despite Aung San Suu Kyi?s plea for
an end to foreign investment in Burma, Evan discovers that - thanks
to the tax loophole of a British Protectorate - Britain remains the
second biggest investor in this systematically brutal dictatorship.
