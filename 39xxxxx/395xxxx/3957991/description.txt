Boogie Woogie became an international craze through the work of giants like Albert Ammons, Jimmy Yancey, Pete Johnston and Meade Lux Lewis. By the end of World War II the boogie craze had died down, but its fire was rekindled by white performers in the form of Country Boogie. Here is the story of the Hillbilly Boogie Boys. Just some of the legendary characters on this 100 track set are Spade Cooley, The Delmore Brothers, Chet Atkins, Hank Snow, Merle Travis, The Maddox Brothers and Tennessee Ernie Ford.
