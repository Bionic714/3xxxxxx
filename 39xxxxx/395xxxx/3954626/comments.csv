Convert it??? It's in AVI format..... lol, if u wanna change it, just make sure all know format names are on, and rename it from '.avi' to 'mpg' or w.e else..

But as far as it goes.. No need to convert it"

Are you crazy!? you can't encode video into another format by just changing the file extension! That would just make it harder for the video player to play the file, it would still be an avi.

To encode video into another format you'll need a program; here's a good one:

,NENE1,2008-02-12T09:05Z,"Is ok for a cam. The autofocus does occur occassionly but isn't that bad, hardly noticable when you're into the story. Would say it's good but not great. Thanks."
