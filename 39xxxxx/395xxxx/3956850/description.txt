This is a feature-length film I co-wrote, directed and produced in the Spring of 2007 about a young adult struggling with her life and goals.

Synopsis:
Ana loves art. She also is a regular person, needing love, food, shelter, water, the usual things we always want to survive. But when those two worlds collide - when artistic passion and real-life survival canâ??t seem to coexist, she is forced to make a decision. The world is a rough place to live, with its super-competitive attitudes toward working, personal image and business and private life successes. Ana comes to terms with the realities of trying to have both worlds andAna Alone canceling them out. What would you do if you had a passion for something and couldnâ??t decide between that and stable life itself? Pushed by her therapist to take a break from the hard life and by her friend to break up with her boyfriend, Ana is pushed in all different directions at the same time, not able to make any of her own decisions anymore. "I feel like Iâ??m back in high school and I have to raise my hand to go to the bathroom," she says. And sheâ??s quite right, isnâ??t that how we fell in a crowded workplace or important business meeting oftentimes? How restricted will she let herself become before she decides whatâ??s best for her and her life? How far would you let it go?
