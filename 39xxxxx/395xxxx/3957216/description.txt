These are the first of many that I will upload in this series. They are basically the original 12" video laser discs converted to cdg and as such the audio quality is unbeatable. My particular favourites from this selection of 5 discs is a tremendous version of Billy Joel's I go to Extremes and perfect copies of Depeche Mode's Policy of Truth and Peter Frampton's Show me the Way. Enjoy and Seed.
