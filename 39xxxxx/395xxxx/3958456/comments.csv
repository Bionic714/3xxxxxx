,bodyguardbg,2008-03-14T14:57Z,"hey. i have the program to play rv files but how do i burn these to vcd/svcd or dvd?, i have little experience with these types of files.
oh and thank you for your uploads, i appreciate it!."
,Deputy276,2009-01-21T07:46Z,Well obviously the person who posted this torrent didn't get his skull and crossbones for quality uploads. This one is a real loser. The video is terrible with lots of digitalization. I'd give the video a 3. It's barely watchable. Even worse is the audio. totally out of synch through the whole thing. And what idiot uploads a video torrent in REAL AUDIO format??? I managed to get ConvertX to burn it after downloading a dll that was missing. So the audio rating is 0. Too bad...this is a good video and has some cool stuff on it. Too bad the person that uploaded it is an idjit :-(

Go troll somewhere else, and please come back when you've found a better version of this VERY fameous instructional video. This upload is extremely appreciated by many, as the video is difficult to get hands on, and the quality of information contained are UTTERLY UNRIVALED.

The first time I saw this vid it was on tape and it totally sucked, but this is a VERY GOOD QUALITY release compared to that. Kudos to you  x_DontTreadOnMe_X.

Thanks Alot."
