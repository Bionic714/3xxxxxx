,Chriswatch,2008-03-16T05:18Z,"This isn't a ""DVD-rip"" its a video recording on ""BET.""  and the lighting is some-what low contrast(dark).  And there is a bad pixel exposure all over the video.  The kind of bad pixels you get if you didn't format the video in good quality.  In all this is alot better than youtube, but its no where near dvd quality. ( He could have recorded the video on dvd and loaded it up onto computer.)"
