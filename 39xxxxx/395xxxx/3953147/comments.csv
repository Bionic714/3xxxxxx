Anybody got good subs for these movies?"
,darkbros,2008-01-09T03:42Z,"Yes, I unpacked the subs.rar per each
folder, getting folders for each release with an
idx and subs file.

However, playing it in VLC, the subs come
across as weird characters, some look like boxes with squiggels, others just jumbled and scrambled but not cohesive wording.

I then tried to run the subs through SUB2SRT,
and it could not convert them. I then tried TitleLab, and TitleLab chocked on the files,
but when they loaded them they were blank.

Any other ideas on how to get the subs to work?
The upload is worthless without the subs...."

and it's quite big punch (2Gb)..
Thanks for the share..."

,jxsilicon9,2011-02-17T04:31Z,The .sub/idx sucks. The only way I found to embed it into the movie is use converxtodvd and then convert it into an mp4/avi.
,jxsilicon9,2011-02-18T05:29Z,Okay I just found a great program to hardcode the sub/idx. Its called avi recomp. Check the program out.www.avirecomp.com
