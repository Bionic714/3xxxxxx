,oddworld911lbipd,2007-12-31T14:36Z,hows the quality?
,cool_midnight_rambler,2007-12-31T15:56Z,"This one is already released in screener quality, so why the CAM????"
,lost_in_the_myths_m,2007-12-31T23:04Z,"Yes, please tell us where this Screener quality is, and furthermore,is it in English??"
,FamousTonyC,2008-01-01T00:05Z,"The screener release is of the 2006 version Sweeney Todd.  Tim Burton's 2007 version is not out on DVD (screener or otherwise) in PB or any other torrent site at the moment.  If I find one, I'll post the link."
,eagle92190,2008-01-01T06:42Z,"I'm on a Mac. How do I run the .bin/.cue files, please help. i'm fairly new to this please respond asap."
,Seany,2008-01-01T23:02Z,"Is tis the same as the Prevail version?

,heirr,2008-01-02T03:17Z,anyone know how to use bin files? i've been searching the internet but cant find anything.
,travelchick,2008-01-02T05:19Z,"I'm new at this too, but you can go to vcdgear.com and click on downloads.  Select the version for your system - it's a small, free program that allows you to convert any bin/cue file to mpeg in about 10 minutes, which can then be played on VLC player or burned to DVD."
,reenforcer,2008-01-02T05:19Z,To view .bin files download VLC Media Player from http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
,cool_midnight_rambler,2008-01-02T10:39Z,"Sorry, FamousTonyC was right. I was thinking about the 2006 release....I downloaded it from a site, where it had screenshots (production stills) from the Johnny Depp version...turned out to be the old one."
,nightstriker,2008-01-03T08:46Z,Is this real or not?

,i_rock105,2008-01-04T14:43Z,what's the quality like?
,AuroraMystic,2008-01-05T00:15Z,"After reading the comments I'm a tad confused, is this the Johnny Depp version? or a different version?"
,Dracola69,2008-01-05T18:33Z,"well, the bin or cue files are used as an image file.. you can use deamontool to open it up.. but vlc is powerful and can probly play it..
and yes, this is tim burton that made this, and jhonny depp is in it.. and its some sort of musical.. havent seen it yet.. 
if you use mac im not quite sure what programs there is.. but i think there is vlc, deamontools for mac to.."
,seljanempire,2008-01-06T07:24Z,"the quality is alrite... although its a much smaller resolution: half regular size, which means putting it on DVD will just stretch it and pixilate it.

and yes, as travelchick said, go to vcdgear.com and download the converter from .bin to .mpg - the only thing is that you have to put the file extension at the end of the converted file, but it works"
,killeffect,2008-01-07T19:23Z,"Ok, I am new here, but I did download this. I used the vcdgear.com to convert it. 
the quality is not the best but its watchable (I give it a 5.5/10). I've downloaded 4 of these and this is the best one.

although if anyone knows a screener quality download please posta link or something!"
,Forgeit,2008-01-07T23:35Z,if it is a bin file with cue just burn it to cd or dvd (depends on how Martyn1122 has set it up) with nero norsome such...
,benbour,2008-01-08T17:58Z,"alright fellas, heres the scoop. for quality i give this 4/10. the audio is pretty good though. not much background noise. 7/10. Now, about the .bin/.cue files. These files are there for your burning convenience. I am a mac user to i use to toast. To burn click on the COPY tab and then the IMAGE tab. Select the file (i believe its the .bin file) and hit burn. You just use a blank cd-r and you will be able to watch it on a home dvd player without having to convert the files or anything. Cheers and thanks for upload martyn1122!"
,allmatthewdickens,2008-01-09T20:13Z,"OK.  This is what I have to say about this:

The quality is what you'd expect for a movie file that is under 1GB.  It looks like it was recorded in the theatre, which is understandable considering that it's not out on DVD yet.  However several time you can hear the person move around in the seat and twice you can hear him burp...  Kind of takes you out of the mood of the movie.

The only other problem that I have with this is simply that because the movie is so dark to begin with and the resolution is so low, sometimes it's hard to see what's going on.

And, yes, this is the Johnny Depp/Tim Burton version!"
,lanilx,2008-01-10T21:40Z,for a bin file on a Pc you can use dameon tools to mount it and watch think power iso will also let you mount a bin
,grumpyoldtrout,2008-01-12T12:36Z,"Right click on the CUE file, select OPEN WITH, browse to NERO exe, click ALWAYS OPEN WITH box, insert CD, not a DVD!!!! it will NOT work, click Burn.

Get the beers and some snacks, stick CD into DVD player, relax and enjoy the movie.  :-)"
,grumpyoldtrout,2008-01-13T00:03Z,"Forgot to say Thanks to the uploader.  :-((

Thanks.  lol

My wife likes anything by Depp"
,kev1972,2008-01-14T13:57Z,"I couldnt get Nero to burn,  kept getting the message that the file was to large for disc. If anybody else is having the same problem i recommend you download http://www.burnatonce.net/downloads/  free software that couldnt be easier to use & i was able to put this film to disc in 3-4 minutes. Thanks for the film Martyn1122 good cam complete & watchable. "

,reality-dreamer,2008-01-19T13:56Z,"Terrible quality, even for a cam-film, you cant even see the text in the beginning of the movie"
,pspaddict,2008-01-21T02:34Z,The quality is shit. Avoid.
,scy69,2008-01-22T14:39Z,Good cam version
,L3YTON,2008-01-22T23:05Z,"Not downloaded this yet but for those who want to know how to burn....

To burn bin files you should use Alcohol 120%, then find the downloaded cue file and burn direct to CD-r this will then play on most DVD Players.

Thanks,"
