_____________________________________________________________Summary__

For decades, US strategists-for-hire have been quietly influencing
the opinions of voters and the messages of candidates in elections
around the world. Rachel Boynton?s Our Brand Is Crisis is an
astounding look at one of their campaigns and its dramatic aftermath.

The filmmaker follows a crack team of Democratic political
consultants, including James Carville, Tad Devine and Jeremy Rosner
as they strategize for a struggling presidential candidate in Bolivia.
This thrilling adventure is a fly-on-the-wall account of the
machinations behind the turbulent re-election campaign of Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada (?Goni?). In a country facing a calamitous economic
crisis, Goni - a wealthy businessman who privatized Bolivia's economy
and created social security (when he was president in the mid-?90s)
- isn't a popular candidate. Yet the consultants devise a U.S.-style
campaign marked by savvy media techniques and negative ads,
emphasizing a single, strong message. They reintroduce Goni as an
appealing brand in an attempt to win an election whose aftermath is
nothing short of devastating.
