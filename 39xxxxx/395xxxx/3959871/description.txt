This is a big moment for old and new wildcats fans alike. Almost a decade since the release of  Lil bastards  wildcats and is design have teamed up to procedure  still bastards  the sequel to the video that kick started the wildcats legacy. 


With Devun Walsh and JF Pelchat at the helm you better believe this highly anticipated sequel is crammed packed full of late night antics including but not limited to extreme radness, excessive drinking, the damaging of public property, insults directed toward innocent people, horribly good dancing, the invasion of personal space, smart ass remarks, terrible rapping, drunken mumbling, beautiful women (hopefully) and an overall talent for poor decision making. All this action is of course peppered with hotshot stunts performed by world-class cast of snowboard mega stars and the up and comers eager to carry the torch.
