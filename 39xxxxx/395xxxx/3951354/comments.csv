,lordbk,2008-01-03T14:42Z,"very interesting documentary. it looks and sounds professionally produced and the overall sound and video quality is amazing.
i have downloaded it primarily to watch it on my ipod touch but the quality was great even on my macbook pro in fullscreen.

a few details about the compression:
resolution 640x360
codec H.264
bitrate 1620
stereo sound
low complexity profile

i will donate within the next couple of days and i am very much looking forward to the next film!"

,cuntycheese,2008-11-07T16:39Z,"great movie.

fuck the US and their copyright laws.  the US loves to make stupid laws.  that's why we have over 2 million people in jail.  you would think that we would have learned our lesson after prohibition.  when you ban something that people want then you just create an underground.  same thing with drugs, even with 2 million people in jail it is easier than ever to get drugs in the US.

now they want to control information.  america should be trying to spread information, not restrict it.  i downloaded a textbook from bittorrent that would have cost me $150 dollars at the school bookstore.  knowledge is freedom, so you tell me who represents freedom, the US or piratebay?"

That is my entire philosophy on free-meda, thank you for putting that in words for me."
,fruityloop7,2010-04-23T00:42Z,"Thank god copyright laws were invented!! The world must have been so boring with writers, painters, musicians and filmmakers sitting around unwilling to create anything cus noone had invented copyright laws yet!
As soon as copyright laws were invented all those creative types started making interesting stuff - just so they could earn shit loads of money!!!
