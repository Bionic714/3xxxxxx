DVD jacket: 
From the time he's a young boy, Rudy (Sean Astin) is determined to join the 
Fighting Irish. But his blue-collar family only laughs as his ambitions--they 
know Rudy will follow his father and brothers to the local steel mill. And, for four long years after high school, he does just that.
But some dreams just won\'t die, as Rudy proves when he goes to heroic, occasionally hilarious, lengths to win admission to Notre Dame. Once there, 
he becomes a walk-on player, serving as little more than a human tackling 
dummy against the starting players.
Bloodied but unbeaten, Rudy wins the respect of legendary coach Ara Parseghian and the other Irish players, who give him one shot at gridiron glory.
An incredible, true story from the creators of HOOSIERS, Rudy is an 
unforgettable testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common 
man.
