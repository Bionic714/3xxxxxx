[V],Subzero!,2008-01-30T03:00Z,"hmm... this shouldnt happen, but iam sure your directx isnt complete... just re.install the latest directx, and try again, lemme know if that helped, and thanks for feedback!..."
,arthurfrickindent,2008-02-22T23:18Z,"Works great, once I updated directx and .net framework.  Thanks for making it so damn easy to deal with!!!   
Anybody know if the update will break the crack, or am I ok to d/l it?"
,mitchger,2008-02-29T15:39Z,"Hey I followed the instructions carefully. When I click the desktop icon and select play from the screen that appears it just says ""Wrong disc inserted"". How do I get around this?"
