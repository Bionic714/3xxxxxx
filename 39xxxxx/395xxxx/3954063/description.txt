Extract from an interview with Kid Dub:


You have done a couple of spectacular Remix's "Daft Punk - Around The World", "DJ Rolando - Knights of the Jaguar" & "Fisherspooner - Emerge" to name but a few how do you go about producing a remix and do you enjoy it more then producing your own original material?

I?m glad u know these mixes? I do a lot of bootlegs.. the reason being that its just fun.. don?t get me the wrong way ? but I LOVE sampling.. i spend hours editing samples?real geeky stuff ? but I really get off on it?

If you release your tunes on a format I can sample from ? believe me ? I will fuck with it?
I also enjoy making some tunes bigger really ? like Emerge ? I love this track ? but its too fast and electro clash for a kid dub set ? so it had to get some treatment..

 Other tunes like Around the World were made for two reasons because I love it so much and because I know everyone else does to ? so I made a massive build up with an extended vocal mid section to really get the feel of it and threw in some emotionally building parts followed by a dirt fest. I have to say ive never seen it disappoint a crowd ? ever.
