,c0rps3,2007-12-31T15:52Z,"It's only the CAM Mod or it includes the game too?
thanks in advance."
,sc4campack,2007-12-31T16:06Z,"It's the CAM mod with the starter packs, more CAM lots and the required dependencies. Without the game of course."
,willywoo2,2007-12-31T19:25Z, Thank you.
,c0rps3,2008-01-01T17:14Z,Downloading; thanks.
,c0rps3,2008-01-01T21:46Z,"After installed the cam pack,  in the residential zones doesnt appear any houses. Industrial and commercial are fine, but the residential zones are still empty. any ideas?"
,sc4campack,2008-01-02T01:58Z,"You should test the pack in a empty region first,  perhaps you tried it in an existing region. Read the manual, perhaps you have an incompatible mod. Check your demand. If you still have any problems, plop the Census Repository Facility (In the rewards menu I think) and post an screenshot of the data after you query it."
,c0rps3,2008-01-02T02:22Z,"I dont have any mod, only this one. But im going to search around and see what i found. Thanks for the help."
