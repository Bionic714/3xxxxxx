Simcity 4 - CAM Pack v2

This pack includes the CAM mod for Simcity 4, plus most of the CAM lots you can get on SC4Devotion.com, including the starter packs and the required dependencies.
This time the pack has been tested throughly and you can be sure that there aren't any missing models (brown boxes), textures or props. However, if you find something is missing, email me at sc4campack@gmail.com

The CAM is the next step in Simcity 4. With this mod the way your city grows is greatly improved and more balanced. This mod extends the number of 'growth stages' from the standard 8 to 15, and increases demand from a max of 6,000 to 24,000 (For Residential and Commercial) and a max of 12,000 for Industry. Also, stage thresholds   (which are the amount of residential, commercial and industrial capacity required to unlock certain growth stage) and stages distribution (The percentage of X growth stage able to grow in the city) are more balanced through the development of your city and regions.

To be more clear, with this mod you can grow massive skyscrappers and large industrial complexes, all without cheating. This is definitely a must-have for anyone wanting a more realistic city simulator.

Be sure to read the Readme AND the Manual, it explains all you need to know before doing something you might not want to do.
