,voodoo8989,2007-12-28T10:58Z,"The HDD may need to be formatted prior to downgrading a computer from Vista Business to Windows XP.  Acer Windows XP downgrade kits (that ship in selected systems) include the Acer Disk Formatter CD.  In the event this CD is missing, a copy of the CD can be created with the attached ISO image.

Note: a computer with CD ""burner"" software is needed to convert the ISO image into a physical CD.

This image have about 200 Mb"
