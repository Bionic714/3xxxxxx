This is a modified bootable Windows XP Professional (no service packs, hotfixes or patches). 

only added thing is that this will boot and detect Hard drive on intel chipsets requiring Matrix Storage mangager.

Tested on Toshiba Equium L40 from currys (originally sh*tty vista) but now running good old XP :P
