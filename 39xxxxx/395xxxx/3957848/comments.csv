,barbarossa_two,2008-01-03T02:19Z,If your gonna up a torrent..why dont you seed the f*&^%G thing for a while?
,DonQuiggifur,2008-01-05T23:36Z,"I am seeding it, asshole :)  I'm a commercial driver, so it's not possible for me to be online as much as I'd like.  When I stop at night, however, I am online, and it is being seeded."
,STriderFIN77,2008-01-09T20:15Z,"holy shit, if this is real! Its a long story and bit old on every aspect, but keep up the strenght and play it thru, and remember the ultimate Betrayal at Krondor game also, excellent story.."
,DonQuiggifur,2008-01-25T13:30Z,"Yep, it's real.  I remember what a tough time I had finding it; My brother had bought it when I had come up to see him one time, and I figured I'd share it, because it's such a tough find.  Hope you all enjoy."
,Quirk12,2008-01-25T18:33Z,"Any advice on how to get the game working?
It always requests Disk 1 or 2, but does not accept the images..."
,ragingnacha,2008-02-11T01:41Z,"Exelent!!!

I have been seaching for this game for ages! Tanks a lot!!!

An it works perfectly, the image is great.

Tanks Again!"
,god45,2008-02-21T13:37Z,"quirk12, maybe you figured this out by now, but uh...you gotta mount it to the digital drive on PowerISO or whichever program you're using. after that all is peachy and you can play."
,rixiarue2713,2008-06-01T03:58Z,yeah righteous!!nice seed but..i kinda don't like much the game..it dont even have control configuration and tutorial!!!how can i open the fucking treasure chests..?
,Malaachi,2008-07-17T13:42Z,"For opening a chest you need to click on it first, then select the ""Probe"" tool and probe each slot this will reveal a trap. The with you best guess you need to select another tool that you think would diable said trap parts becarful some tools don't work as well as others. The trick is you click and try to catch the traveling neddle in the lighter area of the dial, use your brain man."
,Toskno,2008-09-25T03:20Z,I cant play it :s the installation is perfect but it just keep asking me for CD 1 or 2...what am I doing wrong?
,polej_rybiata,2009-12-15T16:25Z,return to krondor! at last! I beg u people give the seeds it stopped at 70% and I MUST have this game I promise to be seeding by few days big THX DonQuiggifur
,majinbejitto,2009-12-30T06:57Z,"When I tried this game on Vista, the bass of the audio was really lacking due to the removal of the DirectSound Hardware Abstraction Layer in the OS. The text in the game also appeared to look really squished, and I'm not exactly sure why. I forgot to attempt compatibility mode.

On XP, the game ran perfectly.

I shall try the game on Windows 7 and see if the text problem is gone. For the DirectSound issue, I shall experiment with Creative ALchemy."
,MookleGB,2010-01-13T23:20Z,hey i downloaded this offa lime wire at least tht wat it lead me to and i got deamon tool lite to try to image it or wat not still doent work.  and when i clik it normally it says windows cn open this file and shows me the look for solution online or open it with a selcted file wat do i do?
,humorguy,2010-02-02T18:18Z,I can't do anything with these .daa files! PowerISO and Daemon Lite don't like them at all! What program am I suppose to use to open them?!!!!
,humorguy,2010-02-02T19:03Z,"These ISO are non standard. PowerISo and Daemon don't like them, you cannot burn the so called ISO to disk, you cannot extract the .daa files without failure. I would not try this download at all it will be a waste of downloading time and a gig of hard disk space!"
,rbell0661,2010-02-05T07:06Z,please ignore humor guy hes obvously a moron or some consumer rights person i just downloaded and installed just fine using poweriso thats all you need. there is no extraction.
,rbell0661,2010-02-05T07:07Z,"btw props and thanks to uploader
you rock"
,rbell0661,2010-02-05T07:11Z,used poweriso to burn to disc even and was able to install and play with no issues
,danger-mouse,2010-07-25T19:33Z,"Hey guys, thanks for posting DonQuiggifur and thanks for seeding will do now, but im having some problems.
I've got PowerISO and successfully mounted CD1 to 1 drive and CD2 to another. When i run CD1 the autoplay appears and after i click install it either does nothing, or a prompt appears saying get indeo.ligos or something. Any ideas?
Cheers"
,danger-mouse,2010-07-26T11:02Z,"ps. i've found and tried installing Indeo from the file inside the RTK disc 1, but it says i already have a newer version. Now when i click install, nothing happens!"
,Thyssyk,2011-06-12T02:07Z,"Downloaded and installed, sadly my windows 7 said ""nay nay, no game for you."" Thanks for the upload though!"
,54adam,2012-03-27T04:38Z,cd 1 worked great and I beat it. then it said insert cd 2 after saving lucas and cd 2 wont load.  It says either app wont load or the file type can't be recognized. I'm using poweriso what do I do?
,bob602,2012-04-12T23:13Z,"Works absolutely fine for me. It WILL NOT mount with Daemon Tools. You MUST use PowerISO.

@54adam... I mounted both CDs without a problem. When the first CD ends, it asks for a retry. Press the Start Menu key on your keyboard and it'll minimize your screen, put CD 2 in the same drive you had CD 1 mounted in, then maximize your screen and hit the retry button. Worked fine for me."
