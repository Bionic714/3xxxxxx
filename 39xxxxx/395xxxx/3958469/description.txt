Get ready for DCâ??s second full-length snowboarding video: Mtn.Lab 1.5 follows the DC Snowboarding Team as they hit DCâ??s infamous Mtn.Lab in Utah and across the globe looking for snow during one of the worst snow seasons to date. Originally the video was to be named Mtn Lab 2.0 but the poor snow season forced reconsideration of the title. Despite that, the video still definitely lives up to the Mtn. Lab name and showcases the fun and importance of the Lab for DC. Following in the same spirit of The Mtn.Lab, the video takes a fun look at the team as they hit spots worldwide and, of course, DCâ??s infamous Mtn.Lab in Utah. The remodeled Lab provides ample park footage along with big mountain terrain from Chile, Finland, B.C. Canada, Sweden, Tahoe, Colorado and New Zealand. Directed by Pierre Wikberg, of The Mtn.Lab Video and Robot Food Trilogy, Mtn.Lab 1.5 features DCâ??s entire pro team including itâ??s international amateur members: Devun Walsh, Aaron Bittner, Iikka Backstom, Lauri Heiskari, Todd Richards, Travis Rice, Eddie Wall, Bjorn Lienes, Chas Guldemond, Torstein Horgmo and Jonas Carlson.
