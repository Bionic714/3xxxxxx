,Blake222,2008-01-13T00:50Z,"troy borg- bcuz ""MP4 format to save memory and it can be put right on your ipod"""
,Madame_Jambon,2008-02-15T10:26Z,"This is an AWESOME torrent.  It works great on my 80G Ipod Video, and the picture quality is amazing!  Not a single episode is missing... you have no idea how greatful I am for this torrent.  I highly recommend this torrent... 10/10 on all counts.  Thanks so much!"

,lemoyneiv,2008-03-14T00:17Z,Seriously. What's the resolution on these?
,kwongsauce,2008-03-21T23:34Z,I just downloaded one video and tested it out. The quality is very bad and the audio is not in-sync.
,polartch,2008-03-23T18:39Z,"Grr....Could some people seed?!?!?! Is that too much to ask!?!?!?!

But thanks! I just got an iPod Video, so this should be perfect."
,youngmoney,2008-04-11T11:42Z,my man....thank you my 78g ipod will enjoy this
,youngmoney,2008-04-16T01:46Z,dont mean to be ungrateful...dont download if you want good quality these episodes are tv ripped and  some out of sync on the ipod
,tarquin4400,2008-04-20T22:49Z,"Everythings great on my sony walkman, except for a couple of episodes early in season 2 (Sexual harassment; Office Olympics) which are out of sync, and a weird echo at the very beginning of The Fight, from the same series (which corrects itself quickly). Stop all the torrent hating! It only takes up 5GiB of space and is perfect for an i-pod etc. AND IT'S FREE! Cheers Mr MP4!"
,s32sam,2008-04-24T20:27Z,Seed me please! Im going 20 Kb/s
,nickjcarb,2008-05-06T02:43Z,dude seeds would be highly appreciated. i'll be lucky if this thing finishes by june. thanks man.

,themills421,2008-05-09T19:23Z,"hey. starting at episode 319 quicktime shows error in trying to play the episodes... can anyone help me? :)

up until this episode i had no problems! this torrent is great! thank you for the upload."
,Badunkadunkz,2008-05-24T06:43Z,"This is probably my favorite torrent of all time. I own a zune 80 and it doesn't play AVI videos so I usually have to convert the AVI files after I download them. This time it's already in mp4 format ready to be put on my zune. Ther are no missing episodes and the quality is great. Also, the mp4 format saves me a shit load of space onn my hard drive. Great torrent Mr.MP4"
,spaldingred,2008-06-01T23:43Z,"so far so good, thanks alot.

please seed"
,gotkate86,2008-06-06T21:41Z,Have not finished downloading this yet but it is going VERY fast for me. Like the 650kbs/second! You all are amazing and I will make sure to seed when I am finished. Thanks again! 
,f4fwildcatpilot,2008-06-09T07:04Z,perfect - download and goes directly on my zune :D
,Coronalex,2008-06-10T20:02Z,"awful, awful, awful.
Very upset at the terrible quality, even worse than you would expect from an MP4.
I waited 4 days for this to download, never seen the office before.
Tried out a couple of episodes from each season, all shitty quality, some had voices WAY off, and all would not even go full screen properly.

Absolutely terrible, would not recommend for any sane person"
,sectorse7en,2008-06-22T03:09Z,"Coronalex you need to learn how to read the description. This is 320x240 IPOD/ZUNE/Cellphone format. This torrent was made for those devices, the videos are for playback on the devices.

So next time READ!!!"
,KarinaAhmedova,2008-07-10T00:42Z,Very nice!
