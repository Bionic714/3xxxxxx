,PsyMan2000,2008-01-19T23:55Z,"Excellent, good work. Ignore the whiners, TPB is full of complete tossers who have nothing better to do than moan at people who share their stuff. I for one am grateful."
,a.constable,2008-01-20T14:14Z,"Hi
I am Alan Constable,I am the Guy that developed this program,it took me 8 months of working sometimes through the night to eventually complete this program.It also cost me a considerable amount of money in purchasing some sound decoding programs.
Its taken this ""Prat"" TRUJAMAN 30 seconds to upload my file fo you all to use.
You can thank this Plonker TRUJAMAN,as I have made my mind up,I will never make another ADD-On for Flight Simulator.
SAD isnt it,as most developers feel the same way as I do.So there will be no more add-ons,is that what you all want,because thats what you are all going to get.

Anyway getting s/w from torrents does not forbid people who test the software and like it, to spend some money for buying it."
,patrioticparadox,2008-10-25T17:45Z,yeah in fact lots of people download s/w to test it and then buy it if its a good product. if you have made a good one then you have nothing to worry about
,JanJaap15,2008-11-29T22:45Z,"@a.constable
if he really would have liked to pirate your product im quite sure he would have changed the name and everything so.... stop moaning"

I agree, to share work made by one man is not fair in anyway. 
The only way to stop people nicking your stuff from TPB is to upload your own infected/ not working torrents with the same name as this. Make 10 of those and people probably won't downlod any of them. Just an idea.
Same goes for Turbine Sound Studios, one man company also."
,JunkParts,2012-04-18T10:11Z,"Boohoo...
I won't download this.

If I wrote something good I'd expect pirates to steal it.
What better way to prove your worth than to have someone ripoffcrack your shit."
