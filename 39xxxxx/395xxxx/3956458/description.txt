Hope you've all enjoyed the end-of-year stuff that Shankly has been choosing. But we've one more before the year is truly out. The year would not be complete without a set of mixes for December. And some crackers there are in this month's mix as well. Don't miss the two Radiohead tracks - one off the second In Rainbows CD and the other a remix of the excellent "Nude". Tracks off new albums by British Sea Power, Destroyer, Minipop, and Jack Johnson. Covers by Biffy Clyro, Kevin Drew, Michael Barthel and Bonnie Prince Billy. And a few Christmas tracks thrown in as well. Not forgetting, of course, a whole host of bands most of us have never heard before. That's Shankly! Happy New Year!
