I can't post them until 10th as I'm stuck Offshore but will get them up asap. How should I post it as the first 6 months is still running. May split it or just have one torrent with the lot. It won't be to big and most can set their Torrent client jus to download the tracks they want. Will have to think about it."

Best Regards,
Bluegamba."

Arthur - one torrent file would be best. At some point I plan to bundle all the monthly mixtapes into one 2007 file and can add the covers to it when I do. "
