,CheechWizard69,2008-05-14T22:43Z,What is up with this?  The description is completely incorrect.  This is not Digital Music Therapy-Compiled By DJ Beardy Weirdy.  And it is a rar file so you can see the files.  :-(   I was so dissapointed when I opened this as I am going to see Beardy Weirdy Friday night and wanted to check out his stuff.  Does anyone have Digital Music Therapy?  Could you change the description so that others do not download the wrong music?
