  SUICIDE BOMBERS - A PSYCHOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION

On July 7, 2005 Britain experienced its first ever suicide attack. 
Four bombs exploded in central London, killing 52 people and injuring 
over 700. When Scotland Yard launched one of the biggest 
investigations in its history, another first was quickly uncovered: 
the suicide bombers were home-grown; they were young British men, 
attacking their own country. Suicide Bombers: A Psychological 
Investigation documents how a handful of experts have dedicated their
lives to understanding the mind of the suicide bomber. It\'s a field 
that has grown rapidly in recent years as suicide attacks have become
the weapon of choice for extremist groups around the world. These 
experts are challenging our preconceptions about who these suicide 
bombers are. What was revealed through early research conducted by 
Ariel Merari from Tel Aviv University was that suicide bombers 
weren\'t mad, weren\'t psychopaths, in fact they did not have any 
psychological flaws that set them apart.
