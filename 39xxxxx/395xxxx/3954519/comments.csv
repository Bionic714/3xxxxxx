,Petrok,2008-01-01T17:57Z,"Hi everybody. Happy New Year to every one. Well, i've got one problem... i've followed the instructions and all, but the game isn't working. When i run the icon it says that the configuration of Beowulf.exe is incorrect and that the re-instalation of the aplication may solve the problem. i've repeated the entire process more than once,but it still doesn't work. I would appreciate if anyone could help me out. Thanks in advance. "
,Petrok,2008-01-02T03:38Z,"I'm beginning to think that it's  aproblem with the file rebuilder. It doesn't do nothing... 
Because according to the readme files, it's necessary 8GB of free space and the game is only taking arround 4GB. Correct me if i'm wrong. And please help out!"
,Petrok,2008-01-03T15:30Z,"I can't believe that there's no one that can solve my problem?
Come on guys... i want to play the game!
Please help!"
[V],Subzero!,2008-01-05T23:00Z,"to expect any help , we should just know what system you own, especially what kind of gfx card, and OS and things like that, and about the rebuilding procedure, well if YOU think its doing nothing, then thats your opinion, me as the creator  knows what it does and that'll be OK for me! ;). last Hint i can give you, to READ the description more carefuly, if you HAD, you would have noticed that some things have been removed (8 gigs are needed for the complete iso release!), this release just doesnt needs that much space as the original ISO release... because some things have been removed ;) ;) ;)
cheeeeeeeeeers!"
[V],Subzero!,2008-01-06T16:05Z,another noob... go fuck ya little sister!
,Danny_boy900,2008-01-07T19:22Z,Thanks for a great relese. I wonder if you can get a rip of Hellgate it would be nice./Thanks 
,Petrok,2008-01-07T21:10Z,"Subzero, there's no need to talk like that and i'm no noob... I just have a problem and i thought that you, as the creator, would be able to help me out.. but it seems i was wrong. Anyways.. if anyone can help, i would apreciate. I have a Geforce 8600GT 512MB, Windows XP Professional Edition and 2GB of RAM. As for the problem.. it's the following: When i run the icon it says that the configuration of Beowulf.exe is incorrect and that the re-instalation of the aplication may solve the problem. i've repeated the entire process more than once,but it still doesn't work. Please help out if you don't mind as i love your rips just like everyone else.
Thanks for your time."
