,Genoc1de,2008-01-01T21:33Z,"Doesn't look too HD to me but oh well, I will continue to seed till 3.0 ratio"
,kmersino,2008-01-01T22:18Z,"Res is still 720x480, my personal opinion is that AVI's suck.  Looked much better before I converted it.  

Genoc1de, I guess you get what you pay for right?

Thank you for still seeding though."
,fixer187,2008-01-05T01:54Z,is this quality better than the previous 1.37 and 1.47GB?
,kmersino,2008-01-05T06:13Z,I didn't download the others to see.  But the quility of this one isn't bad.
,Genoc1de,2008-01-05T08:26Z,I payed for it on PPV i just dont have a HD-DVR to record it.
,neworleanz,2008-01-09T22:25Z,This is a very good copy compared to the others. Video is a 9/10. Almost perfect!
,kmersino,2008-01-22T19:10Z,"neworleanz, thank you very much!!  I recorded the UFC 80, but my DVR glitched in the middle....  Talk about upset."
,carlgarters,2008-04-01T19:51Z,is it a good fight
