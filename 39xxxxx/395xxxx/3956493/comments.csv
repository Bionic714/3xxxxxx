I just have to trust the Cubans then I suppose.

Good thing you had that cigar... cause as every audiophile knows, its the little things around the system that makes the sound better. 

Some crazy dudes say that certain tinfoil-wrappings, 2000$ power cables and interconnects, demagnetizers and so on does the trick. 

Personally I know that the cigar, the whisky (or rum) and good company is the ultimate tweak ;)

Happy new year
