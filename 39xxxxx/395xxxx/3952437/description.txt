RELEASE NOTES

When technical standards domain more and more the arts - Nargaroth remembers!
The new outburst of Kanwulf (Ash) was recorded in 2001 and intended to be
released in 2001 as a Farwell to the scene. Nargaroth plays here a Black Metal
style, which is almost forgotten within the rotten ranks of the so called band
elite in BM. This piece of nostalgic value can only reach minds with strong
roots to itself and the art Black Metal.

The songs and melodies carry every maniac of simple but effective metal art into
spheres of the long forgotten ways. These nostalgic remains, which Kanwulf
created, should be seen as a monument of a brilliant art, which got lost within
the hunger of cheap and economical desires of these bastards, who claim to be
artists within Black Metal. And just like Kanwulf (Ash) said: Semper Fi ~ Always
Faithful!
