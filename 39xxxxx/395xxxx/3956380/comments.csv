,bullanjiu,2008-08-12T23:52Z,"Doesn't work, I've tried with different players: bsplayer windows media player, mplayer, avipreview"
,bassmachine,2008-09-19T14:45Z,"I got this to work and watched it.  this is my altime favorite movie and I know it frame by frame.  the quality is prefect except for one fact.  THE HEADS ARE ALL CUT SHORT, it probably happened when it was convered to widescreen even though it was shot for full screen.  othere then that it is prefect i was still able to watch it and enjoy it."
,nokurwajegomac,2008-09-28T11:58Z,The sound is just horrible. But it's watchable..
[T],Pongydog,2008-10-21T22:57Z,It's fine. No problems with the picture or the sound. It's a normal dvdrip.

,mr.poop,2009-02-11T04:17Z,"Thank you! The quality is fine, no troubles whatsoever"
,skyman299,2009-06-15T01:57Z,You would think that all pirate bay users would have learned to use VLC media player by now. But there's always someone claiming they can't play the files nevertheless
,jcdvsrbld,2009-10-07T00:07Z,"I honestly don't think that its the player or the video (the downloader is most likely an idiot, especially if he cant play it with mplayer, which i prefer over vlc). this is a mp3,divx video, virtually all players can handle this."

,SK3TCH78,2009-10-29T19:43Z,"I saw this movie in the Theaters when it released! It was an awesome movie back then and still remains as one of the best Vampire Flicks of all time! Unfortunately it paved the way for that pussy ass CHICK FLICK movie and that gay vampire dude that all the girls swoon over! 
GOD DAMMIT!!!
Sorry I really hate that movie lol!
Thanks for sharing kirklestat YOU ROCK!!!"

,phairest,2010-12-15T20:53Z,"Props to poster, it's watchable, BUT the sound and video should be better for this filetype/size.  I'm downloading another copy to replace this one in my library."
,RetroidPrime91,2011-07-07T09:45Z,"Almost a 2 hour movie, should be at least 800 mb. Decent rip, it's free...could've been better quality though.
