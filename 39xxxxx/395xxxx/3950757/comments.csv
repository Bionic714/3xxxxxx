Then if I move the slider part to a different part of the movie. It will either give me a still picture or if I am lucky. It will give me some moving video. All in all, not worth the time it took to download because of playback."
,pegbundy,2008-10-22T03:17Z,"OK... I figured it out. thanks to everybody else for not offering any suggestions. For starters, this is a MPG clip and not the usual AVI. My player had problems with the different format. I tried converting using my regular means but to no avail. So I tried a program called ""Super"" It claims to do for free what other programs charge you for. And it converted the MPG to a regular AVI that my PC can read. Success!! It was worth it cause Letha is HOT!!!"
