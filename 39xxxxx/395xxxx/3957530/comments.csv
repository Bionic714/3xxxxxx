,xrobau,2008-01-03T10:54Z,Ah. I missed the 'Smelly Jelly' DVD. I'll put that up as a seperate torrent after I've seeded this one enough (only 384k outbound I'm afraid 8-\)
,eggontoastman,2008-01-11T21:24Z,"Hi and Thanks for the great upload and fast connection.
I only get sound when I use Nero or Windows Media Player to play these avi files.
 Could anyone tell me what codec I need to play these files and burn them as a dvd using Nero.
I will seed this for ages if I can get it to play Please help!!!"
,xrobau,2008-01-12T06:23Z,"Try the Xilisoft DVD Creator.. Apparently that's pretty good.

,eggontoastman,2008-01-12T08:45Z,"Thanks for your reply
Will give it a try. But unless there are some new codecs with this software it may not work. All I need really is the codec you are viewing it with, could you tell me what software you ripped this with?"
,xrobau,2008-01-13T03:46Z,"Xilisoft Ripper 8) -- It's DivX Video, and 128k MP3 Audio."
,xrobau,2008-01-13T05:50Z,This torrent has been superceded.. New one is at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3974714
