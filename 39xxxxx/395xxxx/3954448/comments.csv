,mazca,2008-03-21T23:20Z,"Thanks for the torrent.

However, this isn't the 2004 version of Babylon like the title suggests - this is the original 2002 version that has a notably different tracklisting. Just so you know! "
,ubrmnsch,2009-06-10T08:01Z,"An ok torrent for the 2002 release, though it's missing the last two tracks. the full 2004 US release is at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3350145/Skindred"
