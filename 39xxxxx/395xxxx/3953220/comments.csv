,rocky2006,2008-01-02T21:52Z,What about activation?
,The_Flatliner,2008-01-04T19:12Z,No activation required.  Open format.  Just burn or mount the image and install.
,MonnOmsap,2008-01-07T23:41Z,"Works fine,I can even sync with my amex credit card !!

But it requires to validate to sync with other financial instituion!! Is there a way to bypass this validation ?

,The_Flatliner,2008-01-10T03:13Z,"I use Scotiabank to do most of my banking.  It's great on that site.  Royal Bank though will not allow me to auto sync it.  The way that I do this is to go to the Royal Bank site and then download to Quicken.  Not sure why this is with this particular institution, but it does update this way.  If anyone figures out a way, then please post.  MonnOmsap, I wish I could help more."
,rocky2006,2008-01-10T05:14Z,"Many Canadian banks will not allow a third party to obtain information on your behalf.  Quicken is a third party.  It is a privacy related issue with the banks.  That is not a problem with Quicken

Will this version obtain stock quotes?"

,mikesweeny,2008-01-30T00:01Z,EXCELLENT SEED - Downloaded in 12 minutes and works flawlessly!!! Burn ISO to CD and Install!
,asiak,2008-01-30T21:37Z,"Thanks so much! Works like a charm.. BUT..

you *cannot* have Quicken XG 2007 installed or even UNinstalled on your system. There will be a setup conflict, and you also will not be able to go back and install XG without an error.

I had to reinstall WinXP but so far I'd say it was worth it :)"
,kpg1970,2008-02-03T06:04Z,"I could really use a hand. I don't have nero. I have dve decryptor, shrink and i can't open the file or anything. I need a way to burn this, any suggestions?"
,kpg1970,2008-02-05T09:04Z,Figured it out. Got nrg2iso and converted and away I went. I'm not sure if I should register it or not????
,Copperhead89,2008-03-01T19:02Z,"Works great thanks, i just used nero to burn it to cd and install from there"

,gurlheroin,2008-08-27T02:44Z,"I am trying to open using Daemon and it is telling me there is an error in the command line - what did I do wrong?

Sorry if it sounds stupid - I am a minor geek - I applaud those who stand in the glory of that title :D"
,macatac1,2008-09-08T01:20Z,"I have downloaded and burned it but it will not install. It auto runs from CD and then stops, so I tried other setup programs within the files and then ran Quicken 2008.msi in Disk 1 Folder which did run through the setup program like normal but qave a error at start up say there was a problem and to reinstall, I tried reinstalling 2 or 3 time and cleaned out the registy aswell, but no luck. Suggestions?"
,macatac1,2008-09-24T07:58Z,I have a question for FLATLINER. Why am I having a problem installing this file. Is it because I need Windows Installer 3.1 or higher via WinXP SP3 files. It says pls reinstall every time. It did install properly once before I re-imaged my drive and I had SP3 on it.SP3 takes up to much Hdrive space and I real don't want to do that again. Is there another way to get Win Inst 3.1. Pls post answer.
,jaanleva,2008-10-29T17:19Z,please seed!
,empty3,2009-01-27T21:24Z,"Thanks Flatliner!  installed instantly - seems to be clean and fine :).  Hopefully I don;t have to register, but it did pop up to ask me about it.

,blakpepa,2009-02-11T18:34Z,BIG UPS TO FLATLINER!! I've been searching for so long for this and I cant believe it took me so long to find it on pb. I will be seeding for a ridiculously long time so to my fellow canucks enjoy and pls seed!!
,stogrady,2009-06-19T15:55Z,"Thanks so much for this! Took me a while to find a Canadian version, so glad you were able to post one! Thanks again!"
,giaccovitch,2009-06-22T13:30Z,"Hi,
Does anyone know where I could find an Australian edition of this?"
,Newb787,2010-02-19T08:33Z, This one is is still the best since we dont have any newer versions that are for Canadian financial institutions. 
,rorybot,2010-09-12T23:39Z,"Download/Insallation was simple. Good job. 
I want to use one step update feature but the program says I need to register first.  Can I register with a cracked version?  If not is there any work-around?"
