,badfeng,2007-12-31T05:46Z,"Nice production values, but largely dull. Lots of interviews with prominent neterati, but too little of substance."
,michalisnik,2007-12-31T19:52Z,Nice but the Proprietary Quicktime likes to crash my pc a lot... Next time use theora! ;)

,death734,2008-01-01T01:20Z,its h264 and aac so just screw quicktime and play it in MPC with coreavc installed.
,kardall,2008-01-01T08:11Z,"Ok, ya I have no doubt that the interviews are good. Definately persons that have things to say. But, uploaded 12-28 21:40 and a comment at 12-29 00:05 ... not saying he doesn't have a fast connection or anything, but did he just click the download button and immediately post a ""must watch"" comment?

Anyway. I will download and seed, cause that's what it's about."
,Greytop,2008-01-05T05:47Z,Great film. Seriously a must see. Anybody who doesn't know P2P will definately understand it after watching these two films. X3

,ninjasource,2008-02-27T22:45Z,"this version have awesome picture quality :-)
can be played with VLC videolan player or perhaps quicktime as well

...btw... after watching this film i really got bad conscience for all stuff ive downloaded/copied (and its alot!)... so u could say this film had the opposite effect from what was intended... i couldnt associate with anything anyone said in this film... like, all the trashtalking about the movieindustry... and the ""sketch"" about the girl stealing the rabbit...
...sorry... if ure gonna bring down the movieindustries i wont give u any support unless it is with a hypocrasy-free agenda which in this case would mean that u as well will have to bring down the whole worldeconomy all togheter and make the whole planet a big welfare based union...
only targeting the movie/music/media/etc industries would be hypocrisy"
,Bloodiator,2008-08-12T12:49Z,damn at last i find it

,fruityloop7,2010-04-23T00:32Z,"Thank god copyright laws were invented!! The world must have been so boring with writers, painters, musicians and filmmakers sitting around unwilling to create anything cus noone had invented copyright laws yet!
As soon as copyright laws were invented all those creative types started making interesting stuff - just so they could earn shit loads of money!!!"
,michaelrwatson,2011-05-14T07:09Z,"1.72 GB?! And this is only part 2!? What the hell is wrong with you? This should be, like, 350MB. I watched Part I--a 336MB file--and the quality was great. This is SIX TIMES that big?! W-T-F?!! Fuck you and your mom, you stupid dumbfucks."

,michaelrwatson,2012-04-10T22:19Z,"Wow, 1.72 GIGA bytes for only half the movie? 

That's no way to get it to as wide an audience as possible, you morons."
,metalkiwi,2012-07-04T14:48Z,"@michaelrwatson, dude, it's in HD 720p, loads of files with that resolution are that size. By the way dumbass, you posted twice, the second whinging about the same ""issue"" about a year after your first moan. GTFO!!"
