John Frusciante - Live @ Paradiso, Amsterdam, The Netherlands on the 8th of February, 2001. 
This was 5 days before Frusciante's first sober solo record, To Record Only Water for Ten Days, would come out.  John encouraged the attendants to record the show on camera and tape. This is the audio from the circulating video torrent of the same show (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUQ-Ow4z77w). 
Note how In Relief would later appear on Shadows Collide With People.
Enjoy!
