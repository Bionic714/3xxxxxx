Panther: The Panzer V (2005) 




From 1943-45, the German army relied on the sophisticated Panzer V tank, aka the Panther, to achieve victory in ground battles. Based on and inspired by the Soviet T-34 tank, the German model boasted remarkable features and is considered by many to be the best-designed tank of World War II. Through combat footage and other archival material, this documentary chronicles the history and evolution of the advanced weapon.


Good Archival film footage of the Panther, along with Wermacht and Panzer unit footage. Rare to see Destroyed Allied tanks. Could have used diagrams to illustrate the advantages and differences between the T-34 and Panther. For serious Armor Historians, WWII buffs, and Grognards only!
