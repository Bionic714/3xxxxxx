WinXP SP2 11 in 1


This DVD contains 11 versions of Windows XP with Service Pack 2 integrated. Each version is untouched, straight from Microsoft. The only modification is a patched uxtheme.dl_, so non-standard themes can be used. An untouched uxtheme.dl_ is located in the TOOLS directory if it is wanted. This release is ISO because of the special filesystem required. ISO's can be made of any of the versions of windows on the DVD. There are two 'special' versions, Windows XP Media Center 2005 and Tablet PC 2005 'Integrated' ISO's which can be created. These integrated ISO's have both CD's of Media Center or Tablet PC in one for easier installation.
