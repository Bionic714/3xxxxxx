,delahaya,2008-01-09T02:20Z,"Gee, thanks, I'm an American and now that I've watched this movie I know THE TRUTH!  I was soooo stupid before.  Hey, about some documentaries on the terrorists and what they do?  Or about all the many wars around the world - all of which have Islamists at the center.  Any takers?"

,dzenanz,2011-03-16T19:18Z,"I am not an American and I can't change american politics, but Americans should know why they fight around the world.

This documentary is negative about fighting, but is far from propaganda as lowfreqz implies.

@delahaya Do you know why ""islamists"" hate Americans? Because Americans want cheap oil from them, ensured, forever, and they constantly work on either keeping the governments of those countries weak, or having some american-loyal dictator in power. And of course as anyone who loves freedom, peoples of those countries fight their dictators (Saudi king, Mubarak etc) along with their American protectors."
