,DaMoose74,2008-02-06T19:21Z,Looks much like this one: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3659089/Vista_Ultimate....Butchered_again that I made a while back. Any issues with yours. I haven't been using mine for some time now. Waiting to see what kind of hurdles SP1 presents. I read somewhere that SP1 is supposed to kill off all these pirated OEM versions. It'll be interesting. I'd like to know how MS plans to do that without crippling all the legit OEM users.

It shows up in my disk drive, but when I double click the icon to start installing it tells me to restart comp from the disk to do a clean install????. Does anyone know why it doesn't go to the install window??."
