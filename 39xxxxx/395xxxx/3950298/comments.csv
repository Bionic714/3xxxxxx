,Xach,2007-12-28T00:20Z,I have a small question: Does it include all the drivers that a usual Media Center HP has?
,Kidnice,2007-12-28T22:44Z,I been Looken for this will seed for a good week when i'm done Downloading it  Because I know others who want this also  Hope Its all good  Unoz..
,Kidnice,2007-12-28T22:45Z,This is true >> In some cases when you install one of these on a HP-machine it won't ask for activation.
,pcm2,2008-01-01T17:44Z,"Xach, I don't think they include any special drivers more than the original drivers, but i don't know since I've never installed this on a HP Machine"
,pr0nstars,2008-01-04T14:42Z,"Awesome.  Thanks for the upload; this worked great on one of the d530's I bought used (with XP Pro keys).  Haven't yet tried the second one.

I also didn't get asked for activation, but then, this is an HP box."
,ibseeking,2008-01-10T23:05Z,This works great.  Installed on a new HP Pavillion a6142n that I wanted to downgrade from Vista to XP.  Downloaded all the XP updates without any problems.  I did however have to download the updated drivers for the nForce 430 chipset but that was it!  Thanks to the seeders!
,c_jack,2008-02-15T14:25Z,"i have installed the media center on both my compaq's. it does not ask for activation.

,click4dylan,2008-04-13T23:36Z,WOW IM GETTING 2MB/s!!! SOMEONE ELSE HERE LIVES IN TAMPA FLORIDA WOO HOO!! 2MB/s SPEED BABY WE BOTH HAVE FIOS!!! GREAT JOB!
,CJK88,2008-05-01T20:09Z,Will these installations work on a non HP computer such as Compaq or Dell?
,koolbob123,2008-05-02T04:23Z,Does this automatically update itself (through windows update)?
,88Nightrider,2008-05-07T21:47Z,"Do I install xp then the wmc?
Can i use the TinyXP Platinum instead of the xp that is here?"
,joebloe,2008-05-18T23:58Z,"uh, here's a dumb question - the Media Center .iso is 750 MB.  How do I burn that to a CD?"
,darknessrs,2008-05-19T01:37Z,Note this is version 2002.  I installed this on an HP m7250 that needed version 2005 (according to the key sticker) and my key will not work with this.
,darknessrs,2008-05-19T01:37Z,PS: I did not need to activate installing it on the m7250n
,dfc849,2008-06-04T01:02Z,Anyone tried on an HP DV6400CTO/RX945AV ??? 
,pcm2,2008-07-14T13:19Z,"I've used these on both Packard Bell and Fujutsi Siemens computers and they work fine, as long as you have a valid key. 

joebloe: You need to burn that to a DVD"
,c0mplex21,2008-08-03T21:48Z,XP Pro works great on my NC8230 Laptop. It works even better with a customized nLited install
,XONi49,2008-08-13T16:15Z,OEM XPs will not ask for a activation key as long as its for the same brand computer thus this works on any HP/ compaq computer regardless of what your sticker says as you dont need that key anyways (if you would like to know your OEM key after you install look up Belarc Advisor it will list any MS keys for your software installed
,kyoungil,2008-08-21T18:49Z,ibseeking i have the soloution go to nvidia automactly finds the grphic driver and you need rc97 codec download find on google
[T],stanky1219,2008-09-21T03:55Z,>darknessrs....  THIS IS in fact the 2005 version because 2002 and 2004 will not let you install update rollup 2 for mce 2005. it will only install on a legit copy of 2005 which is what this is.
,KindHead,2009-11-15T05:05Z,Is this SP2 or SP3?
,diablito469,2010-02-14T21:33Z,can i use a 2002 key to activate this?
,yadayadaya,2010-07-14T18:29Z,You can install roll update 2 on 2002 MCE.  I\'ve done it plenty of times.  In fact I\'m here looking for 2002 to reinstall on my HP because they only provided a restore disk.
