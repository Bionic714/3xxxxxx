Plus the guy who wrote this says he is an athiest, well if athiest dont believe in Christ or the devil then why would he symbolize a child killing God at the end? He does believe and he is just a soul crying out for help. I am praying for all of the lost souls out there. Let God in! He loves you and wants you to enter his kingdom."

,biketommy,2008-07-02T23:52Z,"God can enter my kingdom... God is only fantasies and a belief, and thereÂ´s no proof of any gods anywhere at all. People used to believe in Oden and Tor. Do you think they exist today?"
,silverdrake,2009-12-22T14:29Z,"well...hope is the soundtrack from the movie...and no any religious blba bla bla...dont burn me in flames, please :)"
,vampiresRsolame,2011-07-06T04:26Z,"@lunalouise: no, lyra does not kill ""god""... Will does. 

anyway, why the big religious discussion? there's a time and a place. the book is full of religious shit, but what does it matter? the world is full of religious shit!"
