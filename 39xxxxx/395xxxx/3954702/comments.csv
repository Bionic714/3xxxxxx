,skywalka,2008-01-05T11:02Z,Does this work with 32 bit XP aswell?
,XblackdemonX,2008-01-05T21:42Z,"Yes it does work with 32bits XP, but if you want this for 32 bit, i really suggest that you download another version of the game since this is already PRE-INSTALLED for those on 64 bits OS who are UNABLE TO INSTALL THE FREAKIN GAME !

thanks D"

I can't get it to work on my xp64. I may be doing this wrong. I just dowloaded this torrent and then double-clicked the .exe file to start the game. But that doesn't work. Am I supposed to have 1.0 version of Guitar Hero III installed first?"
,strikke,2008-02-08T18:17Z,How do i do to see which XP version i have?
