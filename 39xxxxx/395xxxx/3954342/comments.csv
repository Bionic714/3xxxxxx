,juniorstar2,2008-01-11T02:11Z,"I just find a little glich, here is the fix:
After you finish to download 100%, extract the bouth files from rar archives, *.mp4*, and *.thm* and rename the files MAQ20010.mp4 and MAQ20010.thm. U have to create a new folder inside the MP_ROOT named 100ANV01, and have to move the two renamed files here.
/MP_ROOT/100ANV01/MAQ20010.MP4
/MP_ROOT/100ANV01/MAQ20010.THM
In this order and format will work 100%, tested by myself, sorry about this, I just see it today.
