,chupektong,2008-02-04T07:24Z,"No, It doesn't
I tried using qwix to xfer this iso directly to console still the same. 

Don't waste your time to download. Is not worth."
,billiejean6666,2008-02-06T20:08Z,It works if you extract the iso using something like cxboxtool and then browse to the 'videos' directory and rename the 'pal' dir to 'ntsc'.  Actually I copied the Files so I have both pal and ntsc but I'm almost sure that you only need ntsc.  then rebuild the iso with cxboxtool (or whatever) then burn.  Or instead of rebuilding ftp it to the xbox hard disk. either way it'll work after that.

1. Got the program Ashampoo Burning Studio 7(u may want to use Nero Burning Studio which is easier
2. Double click this downlaoded file
3. Burn this file to disk
4. Pray that this torrent works
5. ENJOY

PS. Note that when using Ashampoo Burning Studio 7 (not 6) when the program is loaded up then clcik on Create/Burn disk images and clikc on the first one and open the downloaded iso file"

,dirtyvu,2009-07-18T02:55Z,"this one works great!
follow billiejean6666's instructions.
first extract the iso with qwix
then go to the videos folder and rename the pal to ntsc
then ftp all the files to the xbox"
