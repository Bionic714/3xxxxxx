_____________________________________________________________Summary__

In a stunning 1994 interview, shortly after the now infamous
Republican revolution, Tom DeLay sat down and laid out his vision
for America: to destroy the Department of Education, HUD, OSHA,
the NEH, the NEA, the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Department of Energy. His self-stated goal was to "completely
redesign government.

How To Buy An Election details Tom DeLay's Stolen Congress and the
story of how he did just that. It's the story of one of the most
blatant power grabs in American history, and how a District
Attorney in Texas turned out to be the biggest threat to the
national DeLay Machine.

The film is a warning about how easy it is for American democracy
to be hijacked by a combination of relentless ambition and
corporate millions. It makes the case that DeLay built a
"custom-made Congress" that is still providing votes for his agenda.

Texas grand juries have brought 41 indictments against eight
corporations, DeLay's political action committee, a business lobby
ally, three underlings and Tom Delay himself. But while Delay has
given up his leadership post, his Texas takeover is still impacting
all Americans daily. His Texas redistricting changed the face of the
last Congress. The Central American Free Trade Agreement, the Energy
Bill, Budgets and Budget Cuts that hurt college students, single
parents and the working poor - all passed in the last 14 months by
less than the five votes DeLay won from his scheme in Texas.
