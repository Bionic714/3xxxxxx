_____________________________________________________________Summary__

The story of the world's worst industrial disaster One Night In Bhopal
is a docu-drama that tells how a deadly chemical gas escaped from the
Union Carbide chemical plant in India killing more than 7,000 and
injuring another 200,000.

One Night In Bhopal uses interviews with people affected to trace the
events of that awful night of 2/3 December 1984, when a cocktail of
ingredients, which included the lethally toxic methyl isocyanate
(MIC), blanketed the city.

When Union Carbide, one of America's most powerful corporations,
opened its chemical plant in Bhopal, there was an atmosphere of hope
and celebration. The plant was designed to manufacture a pesticide
that would help Indian farmers fight crop disease, feed the poor,
and make millions of dollars. But in just five years, the pesticide
plant turned from a potential money-spinner into a disaster waiting
to happen.

One Night In Bhopal exposes the financial pressures and cost-cutting
decisions that sacrificed the safe operation of the plant. It reveals
the horrific nature of MIC and the failure of the plant's owners to
warn Bhopal's citizens of the timebomb in their midst. And it tells
the story of the world's worst industrial disaster through the eyes
of those who lived through it including: eight-year old Shamid;
Kum Kum, a young medical graduate; Suman, a technician in the plant
who struggled valiantly to control the runaway reaction that was
turning liquid chemicals into poisonous gases; Swaraj, Bhopal's
youthful Chief of Police who organised the shocked city's response
despite being poisoned himself; and D K Satpathy, the city's
pathologist, who had the horrible task of examining the dead and
dying.

Those affected by the gas leak died hideous and painful deaths. 
Today the effects are still being felt in Bhopal, where on average 
one person a day dies as a result of what happened that night 21 
years ago.

At the heart of the film is a vivid reconstruction of the night
disaster struck, including a detailed breakdown of the sequence of
events that propelled the city towards disaster. But the film also
addresses broader, contemporary questions. Why have neither Union
Carbide not the Indian authorities provided Bhopal?s citizens with
adequate compensation? Why has no one been brought to justice for
the neglect that killed thousands? And, in today's global economy,
could it happen again?
