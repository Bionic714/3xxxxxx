Amazon Review and Interview: http://www.amazon.com/Assault-Reason-Al-Gore/dp/1594201226
The first question many people ask when hearing of a new book from Al Gore is, \\\"Is it about the environment?\\\" The answer is yes, but it\\\'s not (or, rather, not only) the kind ofenvironment he wrote about in Earth in the Balance and of course painted such a vivid picture of in his Oscar- winning documentary (and companion book), An Inconvenient Truth. It\\\'s the political environment he\\\'s concerned about in The Assault on Reason: the way we debate and decide on the critical issues of the day. In an account that balances theoretical discussion of the foundations of democracy with a lacerating critique of the Bush administration, Gore argues that the marketplace of reasoned debate our country was founded on is being endangered by a variety of allied forces: the use of fear and the misuse of faith, the distractions of our entertainment culture, and the concentrations of power in the national media and the executive branch. In his essay and answers to our questions below, he introduces the crisis he sees, as well as the opportunity for its solution he envisions in the open forums of the Internet.
