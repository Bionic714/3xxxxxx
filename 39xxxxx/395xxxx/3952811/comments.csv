,coolrog1,2008-12-29T03:08Z,YOU CAN THANK ME FOR KEEPING THIS TORRENT ALIVE FOR THE PAST MONTH. 15 GIGS AND COUNTING. I WISH PEOPLE WOULD SEED A LITTLE MORE AND THEN MAYBE THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY DEAD TORRENTS. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU COME ACROSSS SOMETHING YOU WANTED ONLY TO FIND IT DEAD. THAT SUCKS RIGHT. NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY SOME PLACES MAKE YOU KEEP A RATIO UP.
