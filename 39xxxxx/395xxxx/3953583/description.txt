DVDFab Platinum 4.0.3.2 Original License Embedded! *by AxMan [RE-DEU]
What's New:
December 29th, 2007 DVDFab Platinum 4.0.3.2 Updated!:
New: Improved support for CORE X2 protection.
Fix: A freeze problem when copying DVD in certain cases, which was introduced in 4.0.3.0

Installer:
- Valid Key embedded and command send key/ip by update check removed! We wont get logged. Run Patcher if Keys do not more work in upcoming versions to skip key check.
- About Dialog neutral, will show "Retail", you can type in what ever you want temp -:)
- ASProtection unpacked and upx'ed for better compatibility (I do not use eXe protectors again like NSPack and add faked signatures into exe files so virus scanner can handle it, upx -d or generic, program exe =>7 mb d-compressed) No offence

- Unattended slipstream installation enabled, run the installer with the /s ("silent") option.

- portable Setup possible even outside of Program Files folder up to root dir

Release:
1 exe file setup/installer patched.
...No txt, nfo, rar wwwhere to found me added....
size: 5,81 MB (6.093.950 bytes)

Known bugs: since v4.x: custom profiles in scheme Readmeprofile_document.xml, all setting values (fps,...) does not work!

I added xvid cd profile (fps needs to set manually. NTSC=24-25; PAL=29-30 fps), enabled 112 kb/s Lame MP3 should work -> custom profiles

Install and njoy!
