You seem to be stereotyping vegans judging by your smartass attitude, as if you were the king of Darwin-land, but you clearly lack intellect to justify in any truthful conscience your unnecessary carnal desires. You aren't considering the fact that most vegans used to be meat eaters no different than you, so it's not like we don't understand your ignorant point of view (and it truly is ignorant, you simply can't justify it, and you're exemplifying this by mocking vegans like a dumb-witted troll!). You express yourself against vegans as if this is an 'us and them' situation in which vegans have never understood the ignorant culture of omnivorism, but the situation is quite the opposite, it's omnivores in general who have never experienced veganism, so basically vegans have more experience and intellectual wisdom on BOTH SIDES of this topic (would be nice if people would realise this!). You shouldn't try to justify something you don't have factual evidence to base your view upon. Your view is based on culturally-motivated intentional ignorance and fear of the unknown, and when you try to defend yourself on such an untruthful basis you are only lying to yourself.

 Like Dr. Greger says in this movie, it's pretty convenient that the most compassionate diet is the most healthy one and also the best one for the environment. When you connect the dots, you can really see how veganism is culturally essential to the abolition of unnecessary suffering of all kinds.

PS: You're only fooling yourself thinking you have an advantage eating a lot of meat, as this has consequences to your health. But if you'd rather not choose longevity and spend your senior years either in ill health or in a coffin, then good riddance to you.

,VeganFreak,2008-03-07T17:29Z,"Way to go, Alfcha! :D

The most difficult aspect of a meatless or animal-free lifestyle is, imho, not the diet (the diet can and usually is very easy), but rather, the social challenges veg*n people face from non-veg*ns. You'll no doubt here the same stupid arguments time and time again... questions/comments such as: 'God put animals made out of meat on this earth for us to eat', 'What would you do if you were on an island and all you could eat is meat?', 'How do you get your protein?', etc. These questions won't go away until society as a whole gets educated... in any case, the diet is easy, so congratulations and best wishes! :)

,toopro,2008-03-23T12:24Z,"Maybe Pegases is just horsing around... I don't think anyone should take it seriously in any case :) Maybe he's a vegan or vegetarian himself, but he just likes to poke around a bit.

In any case, I know that when I feel offended by the stuff he's writing, I'm not gaining much from my restrictions in nutrition.

I have been switching on and off to veganism, and more specifically to ahimsa, which is, in my opinion, carrying less political, seclusion or anti-social prejudices and embraces veganism as well as many other things that are just as important.

So it's good this dvd is being spread through the torrent network. Thanks!"

,toopro,2008-03-23T12:46Z,"I don't agree with VeganFreaks comment that eating mainly plants is easy by the way.

It's not easy to shift from standard western meals to say 80-90% plantbased nutrition, and maintain the same taste-experience. Food is really important also because it just tastes so damn good, you know. It takes a long time before you got figured out how you can get your plantbased foods to give you the same kick as what you were used to eating.

It also takes a long time for your body to adjust every aspect of it. Your hormonal and digestive regularities, for example, become completely different.

All in all it's a long road, but it's a cool road, you know. You shouldn't be pushing yourself or demanding a lot of stuff, I think. Also, it's not like you're not walking this road if you eat meat or dairy products or whatever. For me it's more about a general direction of your life, or your thoughts.

I sometimes eat meat too, because, like I said, I don't think you should push anything, and I like the flavour of meat and my body has been used to eating it for 20 years. But more recently I decided to totally quit non-plantbased food for another while.

I don't think what we're waiting for is that everyone starts eating vegan. I guess it's more than enough if your mind is in the direction of ""alright, I'm gonna give some though to putting good stuff in my body and treating the earth and all life on it with more consideration rather than just eating and buying whatever the fuck I please"".

I mean, everyone knows that western slaughterhouses are a joke, right? You don't wanna go there, because it's like a total madhouse or something. People don't wanna see it in those documentaries, because hardly anyone gets a kick out of real torture footage.

So, what I'm trying to say is that, even though most people realise all these bad things like animal torture and animal testing and un(der)paid slaves picking the cocoa for our mars bars and m&m's, most people don't want to spend too much energy on these things. I think they are very right in doing so, because it paralyses you if you're not careful. That's much worse than being someone who happens to be caught in the maze of the western food industry, even when eating meat in most cases means that you, as a person, indirectly take up 4 or 5 times more space of the earth's surface (which is because of all the plants that need to be grown to feed the animals that need be to grown to feed humans that need to be grown to feed... erm... who's eating us? bacteria? whatever.)"
,VeganFreak,2008-04-02T04:43Z,"Well of course everyone will have different experiences with veganism, some will find the conversion easy, others will find it difficult. After you watch this video, do a bit of research, and practice, i would be surprised that people would find it still 'difficult' if they actually try. How challenging this is all depends on what people replace animal products with from what they already eat that's vegan in their diet (in supermarkets you can *easily* get soymilk/ricemilk/oatmilk/almondmilk etc. to replace cow's milk), you can use mock-meats or high-protein foods (nuts, beans, etc) instead of animal flesh, etc. There's vegan alternatives to pretty much every non-vegan product that people are used to ( this movie has great examples, or for convenient product listings check out http://veganessentials.com and other vegan stores). You don't need a complicated nutrition planner to get proper nutrition as a vegan - seriously, just give it a try, and let your body tell you if you're doing well or not (consult your knowledgeable doctor/nutritionist if you need expert advice). You'll probably notice your body lose a bit of weight and you'll feel faster and have more energy as the food you eat is able to process through your body more efficiently than the cholesterol-ladden counterparts that contributes not only to the obesity epidemic but also the human potential for 'maximum nutrition' at least as it could be accomplished via a practical first step: going veg*n! 

In regards to Ahimsa, it is a good discipline to follow, however when it is incorporated into religious practice I personally feel it then becomes attached under an unnecessary superficial label (religion) that is used for political and anti-social purposes that excludes the non-religious who do not feel a need to organise collectively as a non-religious entity (check out the Richard Dawkins audio ebook ""The God Delusion"" to understand more about how the non-believer position is threatened by religious groups in political power today). Watch the movie Jesus Camp for a critical view of right-wing Christianism. If you are a religious person, it is only reasonable to practice religion privately and practice it in a secular manner, in order to maintain diplomacy and fairness in society. Don't be afraid of the word VEGAN and feel the need to cover it up with AHIMSA - society needs to get educated and get used to the word VEGAN, because using animals is unnecessary in the 21st century - going vegan is the most effective way to stop unnecessary animal suffering. Incremental change isn't bad, either, but don't use that as an excuse to continue from going further with what you know is truly the right decision.

So come on people, let's move forward, let's intellectually evolve, let's not be afraid to do what's right rather than to do what tradition and this culture of ignorance encourages you to do so selfishly. Vegan sources fuel all life forms in the world as all nutrients have vegan sources, it is more realistic an option than you may perceive, so bite the bullet and jump in! There's plenty of vegan volunteers that will help you if you need it!"
,unrealadam,2008-04-17T01:17Z,"I have only very recently decided to make a change with my diet and become vegetarian. I came to this decision after watching the powerful documentary Earthlings. Two days without meat and counting.
I think I'm leaning towards being Lacto-Ovo vegetarian. As I'm not fully developed in my views on this subject yet. Having only now decided to give it the proper consideration it deserves. I still feel it's sort of ok too eat animal products providing they were ethically produced. Such as organic dairy or free range eggs, provided for in this particular sub group of vegetarianism. But I can't bring myself to consume the other foods I have eaten all my life. The images from the slaughterhouses and factory farms are seared into my brain. 
I have only begun to tap into the wealth of knowledge online helping to maintain a vegetarian diet. And this torrent sounds like a solid stepping stone in my new quest for this knowledge.
Thankyou for your torrent."
,wordofdoom,2008-05-18T02:06Z,"Wow....there you go.....another bunch of idiots trying to save the earth by eating foods that cause an overproduction of methane out of your own asses. Not that I buy it, but if global warming does fuck up a bunch of shit its gonna be the fucking vegans that I gun down first."
,VeganFreak,2008-05-28T02:09Z,"wordofdoom, animal agriculture is actually responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than all transportation. It is illogical to think that vegan food would be more destructive to the environment than meat since it comes earlier in the food chain, and even if it was destructive to some level, it's still more efficient to eat vegan food directly rather than sacrifice vegan food and water to animals just to kill them and have them pollute all aspects of our environment. Redneck conservative governments in North America and beyond are still subsidizing animal products, creating an artificial reality as far as pricing and the true costs of things go (health, environment, ethically). There is nothing ""idiotic"" about realising the truth of these concerning issues and doing something about it. It takes a person with heart to turn truthful concerns into action. Currently we're living in a culture of ignorance, vegans realise this truthfully as former meat eaters, and you can't shake that sort of understanding with this baseless ""i'm more superior than you"" rhetoric. Relax a little and do some research, before you go around calling people idiots, when you know nothing about it."
,klipa,2008-10-15T22:09Z,The Force is Strong With You VeganFreak. Thanks for torrent and upload.
,SquadLeader,2008-12-24T14:31Z,This guy is awesome- thanks a ton Veganfreak! I wouldn't worry about the rude people around here- I remember I used to tell people vegans would eventually die out- I was ignorant until I did my own research... I actually thought humans were changing global warming too- but with research- no more ignorance. You just have to hope others will figure things out for themselves.
