[T],eXPer1ence,2008-08-03T16:41Z,"Why is this over 200Mb when the thing I made originally was tiny?

The whole point of this is that you can dwownload the hotfixes YOURSELF not as part of a torrent FFS.

No one is gonna seed this - but they might seed a 2Mb package which is what its supposed to be.
"
,XweAponX,2008-08-08T18:20Z,"I'LL seed this. It has things I NEED in it:


""What this package includes:

1) cSFV.exe ----------> (to check the integrity of your downloaded hotfixes)
2) taskkill.exe ------> (required for Windows XP Home Edition)
3) WGET.exe ----------> (used by the bat files for downloading on the command line).
4) Two batch files ---> (DOWNLOAD.bat, INSTALL.bat)
5) This ReadMe.txt file.

Just to get that TASKKILL file, this is worth the excess 200 MB.

But 200 MB never ruined my BW."
