Windows XP Post SP2 Updater (x86) - by eXPerience

With this "Windows XP Post SP2 Updater" you can update Windows XP SP2
Home Edition, Professional Edition or Media Center Edition (x86 only)
without the need to visit Windows Update.

-=REQUIREMENTS=-

*Windows XP SP2*
You must be using Windows XP with SP2. DO NOT RUN THIS PACKAGE FOR ANY OTHER
VERSION OF WINDOWS! Home/Professional/MCE are all fine as long as it is
Windows XP with Service Pack 2 installed.

*32-Bit (x86) ONLY*
Windows XP must be the 32-Bit (also known as the "x86" version) NOT FOR x64!

*ENGLISH ONLY*
Windows XP must be the ENGLISH Version! Only English Hotfixes are supported!

-=YOU HAVE TWO BASIC CHOICES=-

*DOWNLOAD*
Run the DOWNLOAD.bat file to *JUST* download all hotfixes, without actually
installing any of them. This DOWNLOAD file downloads every hotfix that could
possibly be needed, regardless of whether your system needs them or not. This
is so you can have a fully updated package of hotfixes (if you are running
Windows XP: see the "XPHF" folder. If you are running Windows Server 2003:
see the "S2003HF" folder) for future use on other systems that might be offline.
If you want to burn this package to a CD-R or DVD-R, please make certain that
you have run the DOWNLOAD.bat file first! Otherwise the INSTALL file will not
work from a CD/DVD because it would be trying to download missing hotfixes
(if any) to a read only environment (the CD/DVD).

*INSTALL*
Run the INSTALL.bat file to download AND install only the hotfixes your system
needs. Remember, this will NOT download every single hotfix like the DOWNLOAD.bat
file does. Only the other file (DOWNLOAD.bat) can download all the hotfixes.

-=AUTOMATICALLY CHECKS FOR CORRUPTED DOWNLOADS=-

When you run the DOWNLOAD.bat file and it has completely downloadd all the files,
a small program will run to check the file integrity (in case there is a corrupt
or incomplete download).

This check is done automatically at the end of the download process (DOWNLOAD.bat)

If you see any messages at the bottom of the SFV Checker Window saying:

"MISSING" = Re-run the DOWNLOAD.bat file to re-download the missing file(s)

"BAD" = This means you have the file, but it is corrupted or incomplete, if
this happens - delete that "BAD" file and run DOWNLOAD.bat again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember - you cannot just run the INSTALL.bat file from a CD unless you have
first ran the DOWNLOAD.bat file on a hard drive to actually get all the hotfixes
you need. Its no use wasting a CD-R and burning these hotfixes unless you know you
have a complete set of fully completed downloaded hotfixes. Be warned, WGET does
sometimes fail to completely download files - this is why I have included the
file checker, but that runs on its own at the end of the DOWNLOAD.bat file
automatically, so you do not need to do anything with that SFV Checker, apart
from just to make sure there are no "MISSING" or "BAD" files when it has checked
the files for you.

Once you have downloaded all hotfixes and verified that they are all good files,
you can run the INSTALL.bat file on any system, whether it is online or offline,
or you can even burn the package to a CD-R and use the INSTALL.bat file that way.

NOTE: You cannot run the Windows XP bat files on Windows Server 2003 and you cannot
run the Windows Server 2003 bat files on Windows XP!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package is especially useful if you have a system that you absolutely do not
want to connect to the internet before Windows is fully patched, or maybe you have
a system with Windows on it that you simply never connect to the internet with, or
perhaps you can't connect to the internet and never need to. There are many
situations where an "offline" updater package such as this will save you a lot
of manually installing all the hotfixes, of course thats after you have also
spent hours finding out which ones you need and downloading them all, link
after link after link...

What this package includes:

This package is purposely kept as minimalistic as possible.

The only things this package contains are:

1) cSFV.exe ----------> (to check the integrity of your downloaded hotfixes)
2) taskkill.exe ------> (required for Windows XP Home Edition)
3) WGET.exe ----------> (used by the bat files for downloading on the command line).
4) Two batch files ---> (DOWNLOAD.bat, INSTALL.bat)
5) This ReadMe.txt file.

The only files you ever need to run are "INSTALL.bat" or "DOWNLOAD.bat"

The way this works is, you can install Windows that does not have any hotfixes
installed (the only hotfix would be Service Pack 2 itself of course), you don't
need to have Internet Explorer 7 either, just run the "INSTALL.bat" file and
thats it - the bat file will check which hotfixes you need and download and
install only those that you need. If you need Internet Explorer 7 installing,
it will even check for Internet Explorer 7 and download and install it if you
need it.

The INSTALL.bat file will always install IE7 first if you need it installing,
(also Windows Media Player 11 if you're running Windows XP) then all the other
hotfixes will install, including checks for if you have installed any of the
components from "Add/Remove Windows Components" and also if you have installed
the "Microsoft .NET Framework" (all versions). Those items may also need
hotfixes of their own.

NOTE: If you do need Internet Explorer 7, on the first run of the INSTALL.bat
file it will download IE7 hotfixes but it will not install them, you will need
to reboot Windows so that Internet Explorer 7 is fully working, then run the
INSTALL.bat file again and it will install the already downloaded IE7 hotfixes.

If your firewall asks to allow wget.exe to connect - allow it.

-=HERE IS A HELP GUIDE OF FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS=-

Question: I ran "INSTALL.bat" but it just scrolled
through really fast and nothing seemed to install?

Answer: Thats because you already have everything
downloaded and your system is totally up to date!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question: I ran "DOWNLOAD.bat" but it just scrolled
through really fast and nothing seemed to download?

Answer: Thats because you already have everything downloaded!
You will know this if the SFV check runs at the end of the
download process and you do not see any "MISSING" or "BAD"
error messages at the bottom of the SFV Checker window.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question: I already have a lot of Windows hotfixes, can I just dump
them all inside the hotfix folder to save having to download them all?

Answer: You sure can! If you already have Windows hotfixes just copy
them to the folder where all the hotfixes are and then run DOWNLOAD.bat,
only the missing hotfixes will be downloaded and whatever hotfixes you
put there will be ignored by the DOWNLOAD.bat file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question: What is WGET?

Answer: Its the Windows version of a Linux based app called "wget.exe" that
downloads all the hotfixes on the command line. Allow it in your firewall
if your firewall asks! MD5 for wget.exe = 4bf24777ec95dcb3e03769def6816518

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question: When I ran INSTALL.bat, I got an error saying the hotfix is "not a
valid Win32 application" and it wouldn't install?

Answer: This happens if your connection drops whilst the hotfix is downloading,
or if you close DOWNLOAD.bat or INSTALL.bat whilst they are still downloading
files. Please read this guide again where it has the heading:
-=AUTOMATICALLY CHECKS FOR CORRUPTED DOWNLOADS=-

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question: I ran the INSTALL.bat file after downloading all hotfixes with the
other file (DOWNLOAD.bat) and it did the SFV check, everything is all OK, but
the INSTALL.bat file did not install any Internet Explorer 7 hotfixes?

Answer: This is because you need to reboot for IE7 itself to be fully working
if you have gone from IE6 to IE7. So if you have a system that only has IE6
on it, just run the INSTALL.bat file (or the DOWNLOAD.bat file if you need
to get the hotfixes downloaded first), then reboot, then run the INSTALL.bat
file again and the IE7 hotfixes will install.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question: I ran the INSTALL.bat file, downloaded and installed all updates. Now
a few hours/days later I visit Windows Update and it says I require the hotfix
KB917537 even though this hotfix is in the folder of hotfixes and also, I have
run the INSTALL.bat file again, but Windows Update says I still need KB917537,
whats going on?

Answer: This happens if you install KB917537 then after that, you install the
optional component "Internet Information Services (IIS)" from: Control Panel >
Add/Remove Programs > Add/Remove Windows Components. You should always make
sure to install any of those optional components from "Add/Remove Windows
Components" BEFORE updating Windows with these bat files. The only solution
to this problem is to manually re-install the KB917537 hotfix from the hotfix
folder *IF* you have installed Internet Information Services (IIS).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question: I am running a non-genuine version of Windows XP?

Answer: Naughty. You do realise this package TOTALLY 100% patches XP? Yes that
includes the dreaded tray notifications (only dreaded if you're running a non
genuine copy) and all the WGA stuff! If you're running a non genuine copy of
Windows, sorry I can't help you. I suggest if you have to use a pirated copy
of XP then look for the one called "Student Edition" which has a generic
product key thousands of people use but it is meant for students so there
is no activation and it passes all the Windows Genuine Advantage checks.
NOTE: If you are running Windows Server 2003 then there are no WGA checks
or hotfixes to worry about.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question: What about the future?

Answer: When it gets to the next month (Microsoft releases hotfixes on one
certain day only, each month - this is informally called "Patch Tuesday"
and is the second Tuesday of each month.

So, I will always provide an updated package each month ASAP after Patch
Tuesday. This will be made so you simply unzip the new package into the
same folder as your old package - this way, you will get brand new updated
files - "DOWNLOAD.bat" and "INSTALL.bat".
