Ty for uploading!"
,Agoogo,2008-01-21T19:39Z,They are only talking French o.O
,alie120,2008-01-22T01:36Z,"True, but they speak about 10 words in total in the whole movie."
,Chery,2008-03-02T02:08Z,"why does it say: ""spoken languages: english, french"" if they just speak french? 

it would be really nice with english subs."
,munkchip,2008-03-02T16:43Z,Great copy. Language is really a non-issue. Thank you very much.
,kidcommander,2008-03-10T21:43Z, Half the point of the film is that it doesn't rely of dialogue.
,PaddyD,2008-03-29T10:06Z,I remember watchign this years ago at about 3am when I couldn't sleep one night and it has always been a favourite since then. I recently got a craving to watch it again and I resisted the temptation to torrent it because I wanted to have ownership of the DVD just so I could say I had it. After searching relentlessly for a DVD I have no choice but to torrent. I'll make sure to seed this as long as possible so everyone wanting to view this masterpiece can.
,keithmoon74,2008-09-23T02:10Z,i downloaded it and it is only playing the audio. i can hear the movie going on but it just shows the default screen in windows media player. help! everyone else says it's a good download. what do i need to do?
,MattG-1069,2008-09-29T14:30Z,@keithmoon74 download VLC (much better video freeware) and don't use windows media player
,bigomelo,2009-01-16T11:34Z,The ones who want french spoken language with english subtitles could try this link: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4032917/Les.Triplettes.de.Belleville.2003.720p.HDDVD.DTS.x264-ESiR

,Phatfish,2011-10-24T18:35Z,"You dont need subs. The whole story is told, and fully understood visually.

Thanks!
