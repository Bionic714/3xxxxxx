This has a 5.1 AC3 sound track.
Not sure why it wouldn't be working on your setup.

If you are playing this on stereo speakers, then make sure your player is set to 5.1, and your sound setup is set to mix 5.1->Stereo.

Alternativly, if you use something like ConvertXToDVD, then you can create a DVD from the avi and watch it on your home theatre with surround sound or your DVD player will mix the 5.1->Stereo.

Hope this helps.
Enjoy!"

Also, this .avi is encoded using Xvid, which I believe gives the best quality results.
You could try going to their web site as they have lots of good advice with respect to Xvid encoded .avi playback.

i.e. I use the player they recommend."
