When he beat the odds, they changed the rules. When he broke the records, they weighed him down. But he had one thing on his side...the faith of a boy. Together they lived a legend that inspired a nation and won the heart of the world.
- He was the long shot...heard 'round the world.
- When they learned he couldn't be beaten, they knew he had to be stopped.

- The Legend Remains

Phar Lap, the legendary Australian racing horse, is as well-known today for his mysterious death as for his fabulous accomplishments in life. Beginning at the end, the film flashes back to the day that Phar Lap, despite his lack of pedigree, is purchased on impulse by trainer Harry Telford. Phar Lap loses his first races, but Telford's faith in the animal is unshakable. Suddenly the horse becomes a winner, thanks to the love and diligence of stableboy Tommy Woodcock. American-promoter Dave Davis arranges for Phar Lap to be entered in several top races, where his "long shot" status results in heavy losses for the professional gamblers. Just after winning an important race in Mexico, Phar Lap collapses and dies; though the film never comes out and says as much, it is assumed that the horse was "murdered" by the gambling interests.

An Amazing Story
Author: alexsturm88 from New Jersey, 30 January 2001

Phar Lap is truly an amazing film, and an amazing horse. The movie tells the story of this Australian horse who defies the odds to become one of the best racehorses in the 20th century. A remarkable story of heartbreak and triumph. Any horse or sports lover should watch and enjoy this movie. If you get a chance to see it (very difficult) you will cherish this memorable movie. Phar Lap is my personal favorite, and I cannot wait till they re-release this wonderful story.
