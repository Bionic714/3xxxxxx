,dirtyodesertdog,2007-12-31T05:09Z,To get this movie with out dealing with all that pass word garbage well put it lightly I'm going to seed for days.Thanks
,fooddude,2007-12-31T16:44Z,"Don't know why this has positive comments.  I spent an entire day downloading this only to find it's one of those FAKE copies where only the sound plays, no picture whatsoever.  Boooooooo...Hissssss......This edition should be removed."
,fetusx,2007-12-31T22:26Z,"fooddude, how bout you get the right codec before you start bitching. This has both audio and video (although video aspect ratio looks a bit off). 

This NOT a fake copy."
,ladychimes,2008-01-02T00:20Z,"Ok I have downloaded this movie, have up-to-date codecs (k-lite) and VLC player and I still can't play this file. Any suggestions?"
,daniabel,2008-01-02T15:03Z,Try again? I played it perfectly with VLC...
,Laz777,2008-01-03T04:55Z,"this is real, thank you webchella. ladychimes, what version of VLC are you using? 0.86b is what I have, and it plays just fine. "

,keith312,2008-01-04T02:14Z,"Someone please tell me what I have to do to get the video portion?  Please....ppppllleeeaaasee, lol.  Thanks"
,Laz777,2008-01-04T03:12Z,"go to videolan.org and get the latest version of VLC Media player Keith. freeware, and very good too, no need to install codecs."
,Laz777,2008-01-04T03:28Z,"if you insist on using WMP, google either k-lite codec pack or gordian knot codec pack. this screener is XViD, you can also find that as a stand-alone and install it...all freeware"
,keith312,2008-01-04T19:53Z,"Laz777, You rock!  Thank you very much!!!"
,TheRealKingArthur,2008-01-04T20:48Z,"This is the real deal a perfect quality movie. Thanks much. Anyone who calls this a fake is an asshole.

Thanks webchella Perfect Upload."
,iamnotanashtray,2008-01-05T23:58Z,"Well I'm not new to codecs or anything, i've been using them since before torrents. I've got the most recent Xvid codec and this movie does not display. Maybe one of these odd media players mentioned would work, we'll see."
,belgum,2008-01-07T20:49Z,"Does not work without additional codecs.  Video aspect seriously off, looks like it should be widescreen but is recorded in 4:3.  Otherwise excellent copy."
,im8up,2008-01-10T04:23Z,"Thanks for the upload webchella! Much appreciated. keep up the good work.

Great download video and quality 10/10"

,stealnwhine,2008-01-14T10:12Z,"stfu BADBOYE3.  You're a moron.  This file works fine.  It's the real movie, and you are a complete twat wasting not only space on this comment thread, but on earth in general.  Get a fuckin' life.

I don't recommend this particular file as the aspect ratio is really, really off, and the sound quality is crap.

352x288 with 64kbps mp3 audio in an 885mb file is not good.  Whomever encoded this did some weird shit to come up with this, and there are much, much better versions out.

Grab this one:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3942752/The.Bucket.List.DVDSCR.XViD-CAMERA

It's much better in both aspect and audio."
,mgac716,2008-01-16T03:09Z,audio only for me using Nero 7
,Mads0ul,2008-01-20T02:11Z,plz seed

,shadypineapple,2008-02-01T23:14Z,what should the aspect ratio be adjusted to?
,Flopis,2008-02-03T16:57Z,"Good movie, and very good quality torrent. Use  VLC Media player to correct the aspect ratio.

,Lottie450,2008-04-08T23:45Z,dont take notice of nukeZ3r0 HE IS SOO RONG lol! 
,tanilfa,2008-04-21T00:49Z,"Video quality sucks -- the display ratio is wrong. Don't bother downloading, it's a waste of time. "
,Dolda2000,2008-04-26T18:17Z,"It is worth noting that this file has got the aspect ratio wrong. For some reason it is encoded in a 11:9 format, though it should be 16:9. However, if I just run it in mplayer with ""-aspect 16:9"", then it works perfectly and the quality is very good given the resolution and file size. At least it isn't a camjob."
