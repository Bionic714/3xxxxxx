,rakan1979,2008-02-02T07:54Z,"How do I burn this? Can I just burn it straight to a blank dvd if I have a dvd burner. If so, will it work in any dvd player?

Thanks!"
,Primusdk,2008-02-05T10:06Z,"It's veery easy

Start your burner software and sellect a DVD Video project.

Coppy all the files from the VIDEO_TS dir in to the same dir in the project and burn

And injoy"

,Primusdk,2008-03-22T05:46Z,"There is 3 diferent audio tracks on this realese so i thought if i compressed it to fit a 4.6 DVD there would not be mutck left for the Video.

But you can compressed it with DVDShrink or DVD2ONE or any simmuler program or even better burn it on a dual layer disc"
,ilive4harleys,2008-08-24T15:14Z,"Buy a box of 10 DVD DL disks. They are about $20+ but they are worth it for the few times you will want to burn the whole thing with no compression such as music DVD's. That is what I do. Of course, not all bands deserve no compression but Led Zep is one of those who deserves full burns :-)"
,joeya2k,2009-01-26T00:55Z,"OK, I read and took all of your advice.  I finally and successfully burned the first disc to a dual layer disc and the second disc was able to burn on a normal disc.  NOW, when I put it in my dvd player it gives me disc errors on both.  Can someone help now?  I want to be able to sit on my couch and enjoy this!
Thanks!
Joe"

,nemosrings,2011-05-28T17:39Z,"You people really so miserly not to go out & buy a blank DVD-9 Disk, I mean for real. You want quality then burn DVD-9 else go some other already shrunk video that's on offer elsewhere. Shrunk means loss of quality, & possibly pixelated in places.

And DUH, the title is labeled Pal DVD, wake up. lol

This is not the place to learn how to burn DVD's. Google it!"
