,cocheese79,2009-03-25T06:36Z,"Hey thanks for this, man, but it's got some problems.  The audio is pretty bad throughout, and it just made a huge jump and missed a scene at the 56:50 mark.  It also skipped once at the beginning during the intro, but that was less important.  "
,Paranoia187,2009-04-13T14:30Z,theres no skip at the intro and at 56:50 hes just sitting on a couch for 3 minutes and it doesnt even change camera angles once so what the fuck are you talking about?
