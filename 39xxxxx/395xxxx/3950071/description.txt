   *|*                                                            *|*   
   *|*  During the past decade, sub-cultures such as latex        *|*  
   *|*  fetishism have morphed into full scale mainstream         *|*  
   *|*  attractions. Thousands of people each year join the ever- *|*  
   *|*  growing crowd of kinky and open minded peeps at fetish    *|*  
   *|*  events worldwide. Documenting their private lives and the *|*  
   *|*  fetish events is still extremely difficult to do, but now *|*  
   *|*  it has been done for the first time with international    *|*  
   *|*  fetish icon Bianca Beauchamp! Bianca Beauchamp (Maxim,    *|*  
   *|*  Bizarre, Playboy, Marquis,Skin Two) is nothing short of   *|*  
   *|*  an international phenomenon on the Internet. Anyone who   *|*  
   *|*  has ever searched for latex images has seen Bianca. Her   *|*  
   *|*  website BiancaBeauchamp.com seduces millions of fans each *|*  
   *|*  year. In a time when the word fetish was wrongfully       *|*  
   *|*  associated with s&m practices, and where latex clothes    *|*  
   *|*  were used to promote pornography, Bianca Beauchamp and    *|*  
   *|*  her life partner and photographer Martin Perreault        *|*  
   *|*  invaded the Internet with their own style of fetish       *|*  
   *|*  photography, borrowing styles from mainstream fashion     *|*  
   *|*  and old school pinup erotica. The tasteful results with   *|*  
   *|*  elaborate sets and latex couture is what set them apart   *|*  
   *|*  in what has now become latex fetish modeling, a concept   *|*  
   *|*  that was non-existent with this type of clothing prior    *|*  
   *|*  to their venture. BIANCA BEAUCHAMP : ALL ACCESS offers a  *|*  
   *|*  candid, funny, and intimate visit inside the private and  *|*  
   *|*  public circles of one of the most famous fetish icons of  *|*  
   *|*  our time. You'll follow Bianca Beauchamp through three    *|*  
   *|*  days and three nights during one of the most playful      *|*  
   *|*  fetish events worldwide (Montreal Fetish Weekend). Party  *|*  
   *|*  with Bianca and her close friends and models in the       *|*  
   *|*  privacy of her home, attend a funky book signing, and     *|*  
   *|*  visit a fetish event full of kinky peeps dressed in latex *|*  
   *|*  from head to toe. BIANCA BEAUCHAMP : ALL ACCESS is        *|*  
   *|*  without a doubt the most fun you can get at a fetish      *|*  
   *|*  event without actually having to dress-up!                *|*  
   *|*                                                            *|*
