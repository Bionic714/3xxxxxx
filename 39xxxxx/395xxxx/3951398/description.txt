features all but one track (as far as I know) - the only one missing is \'Declaration\' which was b-side to the House of Ecstasy 7\" single.  The band are Anita Chellamah (ex-pop group Toto Coelo), Andy McCoy (ex-Hanoi Rocks), Dave Tregunna (ex-Sham 69, Lords of the New Church - later of Kill City Dragons), Nasty Suicide (ex-Hanoi Rocks, later of Cheap and Nasty, now retired and working as a pharmacist!), Terry Chimes (was in a very early line up of the Clash).
