Description from the back of the DVD cover:

"Ever since the plane's maiden flight in 1971,the DC-10 has been in service with large number of airlines for flying from continent to continent. The aircrafts' typical third propulsion unit mounted at the tail is part of one of the most outstanding civil aviation developments in the las decades.

The aircraft is flown with a three-man crew in the cockpit consisting of the captain,the first officer and a flight engineer. Although the plane has seen a great deal of service,it appears to have lost little if its original charm.

This film consists of scenes from over 20 years of DC-10 history including many interesting pictures from the archives. 

The highlight of this film centres on a flight with a DC-10 from Frankfurt to Beijing.

How is navigation carried out on board a DC-10, what duties does a flight engineer have to cope with and what takes place during 10 hour flight to Beijing? This film is  really interesting and not just for DC-10 fans."



This DVD is not so technical as DVDs from http://www.worldairroutes.com, 
 
http://www.justplanes.com or http://www.itvv.com but is very interesting, 

especially for DC-10 fans,as my self.
