Hey guys, Mike Mindless of The Skulls personally passed this compilation to me and requested that I torrent it.  Yes, this has official material in it, but Mike wants the world to know how great The Skulls were!  Here is what Mike had to say:

The 2 covers from Sweet & X are listed, this is a compilation of demos and both records, Dress Up & Die and Blacklight 13, released on Buy Our Records from New Jersey from 1986 to 1988.

Adrenalin OD later covered our song Coffin Cruiser.
