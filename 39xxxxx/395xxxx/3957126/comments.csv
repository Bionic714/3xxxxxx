,mikemn,2008-01-02T07:14Z,lol nice virus nod32 found 1 in the exe also 
,Triko80,2008-01-02T10:48Z,It wokrs on Windows XP. You just have to run file Racing.exe. There aren't any viruses.
,Triko80,2008-01-02T10:50Z,It is just an old game and it may be seen as a virus.
,Crillie,2008-01-03T16:53Z,Btw copy that link into explorer if it gives u trouble.
,Crillie,2008-01-03T16:56Z,"I´m not saying it IS a virus, could be false positive, but you´re stupid if you don´t listen to NOD32 in any case ;)"
,Triko80,2008-01-03T23:10Z,"I'm not stupid, OK? I've been looking for this game very long time and finally my friend has bought it and I thought somebody would want to download it. There aren't any viruses. I play in it and it works well. Have somebody played in it already or I upload it without a need?"
