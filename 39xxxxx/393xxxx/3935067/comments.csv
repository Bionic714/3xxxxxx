This is an amazing looking compilation.  
Must.
Have.
It.

Thanks!"
[T],Geedunk,2008-01-04T21:21Z,"It sure as hell is, but the disc 5 sucks ass imo xD. But no compilation without the whole lot (;.

- I hope you like, enjoy and share the music :D"
,El_Napalmo,2008-02-09T21:40Z,Hi. Was this ripped from the real boxset? Is this the real thing. 'cause I downloaded it and it seems that all the tracks were just collected from the original discs and put together. All the IDs in the tracks are related to the original records! That I could have done myself. I wanted the real thing! Maybe I'm wrong.
[T],Geedunk,2008-02-09T23:58Z,"It is the original boxset, I can send you a picture of it. I wasn't connected to the internet whilst ripping them, so I had to put every single ID3 tag onto myself."
,kErginsAl,2008-02-10T02:18Z,"Looked like a great collection, until I saw that it's encoded in wma. If you're going to encode music in a lossy format, encode it in mp3 or ogg vorbis (various bitrate) and use EAC for ripping the cds.
Redo and do it right! And then I will download."
,El_Napalmo,2008-02-10T15:43Z,"Hi Geedunk. Thanks for the info. And thanks for the boxset.
Some scans of the booklets and box would be more than welcome! :) I like to watch and read all that stuff. I have the first boxset as well and I found out a pdf file in the Earache myspace. But they didn't included a pdf for the second box. :("
[T],Geedunk,2008-02-10T16:25Z,"kErginsAl: Be happy that I even uploaded it. Why don't you go spend 20 bucks yourself on it, instead of complaining?"
,Manhax,2008-02-18T21:35Z,Thanks for a great package!
,TMA2,2008-04-02T06:42Z,"Geedunk, why don't you learn to encode with formats that don't lick my taint, instead of complaining? WMA shouldn't be used by _anybody_."
,shervy1970,2008-05-09T08:30Z,"thanks for the time mate, really apprecciated"
,darklingmiss,2008-05-29T03:24Z,"Great list, too bad they're wma's"
,jasonhoulton,2008-08-12T17:56Z,cheers mate
,taiiat,2008-10-05T22:16Z,"geedunk:
dont worry about the retarded ppl that dont know how to use anyhting but mp3's. theyre just stupid, format doesnt matter. as long as its readable by a computer it should be fine. lol just for tall theyre complaining the next audio torr u make make the files .vob's and really piss em off. 

looks great btw, the first boxset was great, hoping 2 is just as good."
,plop888,2008-12-27T02:19Z,Thanks for posting this. The first collection is excellent.
,PsychopathicMetal08,2009-06-11T15:27Z,If you want them in mp3 that badly you can use a converter like im going to. Only reason im converting it is because for some unknown reason my comp has an issue with .wma and I have the codecs and everything.... 
,PsychopathicMetal08,2009-06-11T15:29Z,"I'd also like to add that I fucking the organization on the filename's, they're layed out perfectly. I can't stand these torrents with lowercase characters, underscores and dashes.... they waste 10 minutes of my time just to rename them so they don't look horrible lol"
,TMA2,2010-01-24T14:26Z,"transcode from wma > mp3 will only worsen the quality, as it's lossy to lossy. format and bitrate DO matter."
