,freestyleip,2008-01-26T00:14Z,"actually just remembered something about the film, not sure if it was me and the way i burnt the film but every so often there were weird horizontal lines i think it was accross the screen. Doesnt affect the picture in respect of watching the film but you do notice it... anyone else had this or just me ?"
