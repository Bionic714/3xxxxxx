Let's see if it will allow me to enter it here. . .  If the next line does not contain a Web Site Address, then sorry, I tried!

,ElvisNewKing,2007-12-21T07:50Z,"Hello Everyone,

I have seeded this movie for approximately 44 Hours and uploaded over 10GB.  In an effort to not piss off my ISP, I am going to continue seeding until around midnight Saturday (EST).  The trend that I am seeing from most of you so far is once you have 100% of the file you stop seeding and move on.  So, if anyone actually reads these comments, this is your fair warning that the ElvisNewKing gravy train ends in approximately 22 hours in case someone else is interested in receiving the torch and taking over to keep this torrent alive.

Happy Holiday's to everyone, and I hope you find this movie thought provoking !!!"
,powerman5000,2007-12-21T21:25Z,"Amazing Movie .
Put together very well and flows nicely throughout ."
,ElvisNewKing,2007-12-22T08:15Z,"That's all folks.  I hope someone else can seed this movie for a while.  Gotta' take a break for a few days.  If anyone is interested, perhaps I can re-seed after I return from Christmas Vacation.

Take care and be well!"

,rajivuncoiling,2008-06-28T10:17Z,"one of the best researched documentary even produced. i personally think that part I was not required its useless to hurt anybody's religious sentiments regardless to his/her caste color and creed. even if what they say in part I is 100%, which i doubt, what matters in religion is faith not history. rest of the movie is no doubt an eye opener for all people those who think they are rewarded for their hard work and honesty, in fact there are criminal and swindlers with trillion of dollars to swindle any single penny they can get from you. MUST WATCH AND DISTRIBUTE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL. may god bless you all, regardless to your caste, color and creed."
