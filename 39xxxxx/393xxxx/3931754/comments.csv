,waha,2007-12-14T08:30Z,"Just FYI, there's a 1.01 patch available at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3933057 that fixes a few missed English voices."
,z4rd,2007-12-14T15:54Z,"""Horrible dub"" is sorta unfair to FF12, since it has one of the best dubs lately.

Sure, some of the characters are just plain flat but on the whole the dub is mighty fucking impressive.

EN dubs in general need to burn in hell though."
,Spetsnaz420,2007-12-14T18:31Z,I think that this is a really sweet idea...but I'd sooner deal with a FFX undub b/c that was bad dubbing...FFXII was actually pretty good
,z4rd,2007-12-14T19:16Z,"Mind you, even though I didn't mind the dub, I'm still leeching this.

There's some way too good jap actors in there to miss their performance"
,pether,2007-12-16T16:30Z,"Are the subs still in this?
My japanese isnt good enough to understand everythin they say. :P"
,z4rd,2007-12-17T19:26Z,"
""  Here's a treat for those of you who love Japanese RPGs but can't
  stand the increasingly bad english voice jobs!  This UNDUB has
  the USA english text with the original Japanese spoken dialog. ""

,z4rd,2007-12-22T15:13Z,"I gotta say.
I actually prefer the dubbed Balthier. Then again, he's easily the best written character in the dub."
,stassano,2008-01-13T08:39Z,I am somewhere half true FFXII and it is amazing to me thanks to you awesome un-dub. I hope you continue your great work!!! Thanks for bringing quality to the world!

,xniper111,2008-06-22T20:36Z,I was just wondering: Can i play this game in my PC ? With the emulator pcsx2 ?
,xniper111,2008-06-23T14:26Z,Please people seed.
,TwinBar,2008-09-20T07:14Z,"How do you install this one? Can you install it on the computer? If not, can it be run on pcsx2?

And if it can, can someone please tell me how to actually run a game on it? I can't get any straight answers."
,3000201,2008-09-30T07:43Z,Can i use Daemon Tools to upload this?
,BardoftheOzarks,2008-12-08T21:21Z,"Well, Adam.  First of all, there are therapists that can help you with your bitterness.  We've all been newbs at some point.  There are several ways that they could be misguided by using search engines, while the answers to their simple questions can be answered in a matter of minutes by people with more experience in these matters.

For the newbs: There are a couple of ways to access the game.  If you have a PS2, you can burn the image file to a blank DVD and INSTANT GAME.  To run it on your computer, put the disc in your computer and run it through an emulator of your choice.  Possibly the most popular is PCSX2.  If you can't burn DVDs or just don't want to waste the disc, get a program called MagicDisc by the makers of MagicISO.  It will allow you to make your computer think it has an extra disc drive that you can only load ISOs on.  From there, just act like you have the disc in the drive and use the emulator.  For more detail instructions on each of these programs, go to their respective help pages for walkthroughs and demonstrations."
,deathshadows,2009-01-12T17:00Z,"Im having a problem playing this on PCSX2. There is no text commands. I dont see any menu options they are all blank I just see the cursor pointing to them wtf? Like at the beginning of the game the tutorial has no words in the text boxes, they are just blank. Also before I start the game I cant see any options."
,trippay,2010-04-09T15:42Z,"just a heads up -- if you have the PAL version of the game already and want to transfer your savegames to this one, they _ARE_ compatible.  verified this myself."
,trippay,2010-04-09T15:48Z,"also, bardoftheozarks is a fucking moron.  you can't just burn the game and play it on a PS2.  you need to either have a modchip or a softmod (i use FMCB+ESR personally) first."
,stnkvcmls,2010-04-22T16:36Z,please seed :(
