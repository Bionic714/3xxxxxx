Michael Travesser says he's the Messiah. He claims that 31 October 2007 is Doomsday and at midnight on that date there will be an event of apocalyptic proportions, marking the end of the world. Formerly a sailor called Wayne Bent, Michael is the leader of a cult in New Mexico called Strong City.

??.Bent lived on a commune named Strong City in a remote corner of New Mexico with around 60 followers. He believed that the world would end on 31 October 2007, something he and his brethren anticipated with rapturous delight.

In order to prepare for this momentous event, God told Bent to gather seven virgins, one of whom was just 15. Director Ben Anthony - who gained unprecedented access to Strong City - filmed two girls happily recounting the moment when God told them to "stand naked" in front of Bent.

How did this thought get into their heads? Perhaps it had something to do with the post Bent wrote which encouraged women to stand naked before Him.
Bent claimed that it wasn't sexual.

He did, however, admit to having sex with his son's wife. "God came down on Michael and forced him to consummate with Christiana," said the grandson of God calmly. "It was a terrible, strange act of God." It was a bit, yeah.

Inadvertent amusement aside, there was something terribly angering about all of this: Bent had systematically broken the spirits of vulnerable people to the point where they believed that the outside world was evil and that death was salvation?.?
