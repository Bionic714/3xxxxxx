I liked it a lot, loved the happiness in their faces and understood why they stayed in Strong City instead of ur world--no taxes, no branding, no world terror, no ipods plus faith in something. My kudos to all of them, my laughter to the manipulative documentarist who's dying to prove that they're all wackos and was praying that the would commit mass suicide and he'll get the Pulitzer or something. Since nothing like that happened he focused on the ""sex"" thing, like this guy couldn't find a better way to have sex if that was his ultimate goal. God, i hate prejudiced documentarists. I researched about it and u shoud take a further look to the community's POV through their website http://strongcity.info/"

These people live not too far from me and, trust me, they are whacked out of their brains.  You can envy their faith or lifestyle if you want, but the cold truth remains that they live a very sad and strange existence, alienated from the rest of New Mexico in a world of sin-torture and (ironically) sexual perversion.  Yes the doc was skewed, but remember that you just visited a website while this guy spent a healthy amount of his life studying and filming them.  And, yes, they do have ipods.  Great doc, thanks so much for uploading and sorry about the rant, they chill me to the bone."
,Shillum,2008-02-23T18:09Z,"dvdjjl:  You say our community chills you to the bone.  A rancher in your community visits us whenever he wants to be uplifted and blessed.  He just drops in and chats.  You say we live a very strange and sad experience.  How do you know this?  I can agree that we give you the chills.  Your natural world is one of separating yourself from other souls and living in a selfish world of me, me, me.  When you are invited to become one with others and vulnerable, it gives you the chills. This is why your world hates us so much.  You cannot stand being exposed to the truth.  It chills you to the bone."
