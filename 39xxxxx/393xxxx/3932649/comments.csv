,vEcToR_2007,2007-12-14T10:23Z,I am sorry guys but this RIP seems to be incomplete. I installed it lastnight when I discovered this. Although the plane is just fantastic to see. Made some cat-shots with it already. Cool. It was uploaded by Gaffa07 on Humyo but some files are zero bytes. We'll have to wait until he makes the set complete.
