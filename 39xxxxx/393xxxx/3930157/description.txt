"bedroom songs" is a collection of lullabies. the songs were recorded in one sitting each, in the middle of the night in the middle of the summer. it was hot.

the first pressing consisted of only one copy, handmade with a handwritten insert. the album art is from the 2007 reissue. it is drawn by emma sartwell, and the title was purposely left blank so that one could customize their own title. popular ones included "parade parade and his melancholy whores," "parade parade and simon and garfunkel," and "parade parade and stop telling chuck norris jokes, start living your life."
