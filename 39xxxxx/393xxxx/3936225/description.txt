          Full title: See You On The Other Side: Deluxe Edition. This is an Enhanced CD, which 
          contains both regular audio tracks and multimedia computer files. Korn: Jonathan     
          Davis (vocals); Munky (guitar); Fieldy (bass guitar); David Silviera (drums).        
          Producers: The Matrix; Atticus Ross; Leo Ross. Recording information: Henson         
          Recording Studios, Hollywood, California (2005). This 2005 album is not only Korn's  
          initial outing for a new label (Virgin), it marks the veteran nu-metal act's first   
          record without founding guitarist Brian "Head" Welch (who left the band after        
          becoming a born-again Christian). Changes for the California group don't stop        
          there--SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE is largely produced by the Matrix, the team best    
          known for providing a slick sheen on songs by Avril Lavigne and Liz Phair. Given all 
          of these transitions, it's not surprising that this record seems notably different   
          than past Korn offerings, with an industrial element both streamlining the quartet's 
          sound and giving it more weight. Although guitar and bass are still prominent on     
          these heavy tracks, greater attention is given to Jonathan Davis's vocals, which are 
          unusually melodic at times (particularly on "Politics" and "For No One"), and David  
          Silviera's punishing work on the drum kit. The result is an unapologetically direct  
          album by a revamped band that seeks to stay true to its past while looking ahead     
                                                                                               
                                                                                               
                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and albuminfo,           
                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         
                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
