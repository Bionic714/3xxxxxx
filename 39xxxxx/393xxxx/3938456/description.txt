Years of Blood 

Examines the bloody terrain of the Middle East over the past six 
years. Politicians and decision makers offer their views on the 
issues, and a new understanding of the labyrinth of conflict in the 
region is brought to light.

Part 2 - Enemies

In 2002, Israel launches a large incursion into the West Bank, and 
places Arafat's compound in Ramallah under siege, effectively 
isolating Arafat and his 400-strong loyal guards from the outside 
world. Then came the Jenin battle, where several Israeli soldiers 
and scores of Palestinians were killed. Sharon decides to implement 
the disengagement plan with Gaza, announcing a unilateral withdrawal 
from the Gaza strip, which was occupied in 1967. 22 settlements, 
some built in the early 70s, are slated for eviction. Under pressure 
from the UN and Western countries, Arafat accepts the creation of 
the position of Prime Minister.
