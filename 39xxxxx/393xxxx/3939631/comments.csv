,Dirty50ck5,2007-12-27T02:21Z,"Thanks, I picked up the ""soundtrack"" at Wal-Mart and much to my dismay after I opened it, it was only the highlights, thanks for putting the deluxe edition up!"
,spargett,2007-12-28T08:54Z,"Nice, thank you very much. I just saw the film. I'm very excited to have the soundtrack, there were some amazing pieces in here.

,FiftyThreeEcks,2007-12-28T20:20Z,"Lucky you got to see it! Paramount only released 600 copies of it, so no theaters within 400 miles of me get it! I can't wait for it to come here so I can see it... V_V Thank you very kindly for the OST however!"
,allmatthewdickens,2007-12-31T23:49Z,This is a very nice soundtrack.  Works nicely.  Thank you!

,KopaKura,2008-01-18T22:08Z,"Thank you muchly for this.

I am watching the film now, and Depp's voice is absolutely amazing, it's a shame I'm stuck with such a low quality cam version of the film, as I'm too young to see it at the cinema, how I wish it could be put down by one rating, I'd be able to see it properly."

,ne0rotic,2008-01-29T22:11Z,"Okay yes, I'm noob -whatever - that being said. I'm not computer illiterate.. just new to torrents and dvd burning. 

Programs I'm using: 
ConvertXDvd
Nero 7
Magic ISO
Winrar

Recurring problem:
[Some] torrents I download are in winrar. I do have winrar. When i d/l the file I get several files.. usually around 25 of them are winrar files.. the others aren't identified by my computer. The extentions are .r31, .r32, etc. I keep trying to extract here the 25 files identified by winrar.. which gives me one .img file. Nero and Magic ISO keep burning up to chapter 11 and saying burning complete. I've now gone through about 7 blank DVD's and through trial and error, and error, and error - can't figure out the problem. 

When I get a .avi file.. I simply use ConvertxDVD, convert, then slow my speed to burn and it works.. but I can't use convertxdvd because it's a .img file. Help anyone? "
,1057,2008-02-03T05:27Z,"Only a few minutes into the film, I had to stop it and come back for the soundtrack!!

Many thanks for the upload! (^_^)

Plus, I just started the download, and it is already almost finished. Appreciation, to all, for keeping this one well seeded. (^_^)b

,lazerustheduck,2008-02-03T19:02Z,It looks like piss.....It smells like piss......It's.....well it's effing brilliant really.
,emmer.91,2008-02-04T21:57Z,"Works perfectly. Great download speed as well, had the whole thing in five minutes!! Awesome. "
,BasicKiller,2008-02-09T23:58Z,"ne0rotic:
img is actual a cd/dvd image can written to cd/dvd. Normally movies torrents with img bin iso files are either DVDs or VCDs images. So can burn them... I would suggest u to install PowerISO so u can varify img before burning it

and about the rar files. just open .rar with winrar and extract it. winrar will automatically load r31 r32... when needed.

hope that help. take care"
,Jonny_Goodboy,2008-02-25T19:27Z,"Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter cannot sing. Their voices are really weak. The movie is great, but if you want the music you should go for the Broadway recordings."
,Dash-2,2008-02-26T08:37Z,This is the Deluxe Edition in case anyone was wondering (definitely better then the 16 track version). Great quality and super fast download. Thanks!
