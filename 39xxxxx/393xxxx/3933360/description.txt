Oxia - Lost Memory 2007 [Tech House / Techno]


Currently sitting pretty at Number 4 and still rising in the Beatport Top 10 (it literally just moved from Number 5 whilst typing this, and was at Number 8 on Monday just gone).

Just for your information, Deadmau5 Vs. Jelo "The Reward Is Cheese" is now sitting at Number 5 and can also be found on my release schedule.

Those of you who may already be aware of this recent and entirely successful release will do well to check out my previous post of Jeff Samuel's "Fire" if you haven't already done so.

Those who are curious about the fields of Tech House / Minimal / Techno on the more  electric and up-beat side of things are strongly advised to give both titles a try.


Lots of energy to burn here people.  I've been at it with this track every day since release.



Enjoy and please seed.
