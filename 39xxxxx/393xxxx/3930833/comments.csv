But that dude 'the cleric' must be out his f*ckin mind if he don't think this shit has good sound quality. I put this shit up yesterday. Who had it up before me. Nobody. Give me some credit muthaf*cka. If you can get a better copy as of 12/12/07 (now), than do it. Otherwise shut the f*ck up n*gga. To everybody else, thx for the appreciation and seeding. It is definately worth the download."
