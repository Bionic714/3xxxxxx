,Audiophile_01,2012-04-14T09:06Z,"Thanks for the upload cholo24, however those downloading should note that these files are a 320Kbps re-encode from a lower bit-rate rip. This is because the audio frequency has been cut off at 16000Hz. This doesn't occur in a 320kbps re-encode from a direct source. "
