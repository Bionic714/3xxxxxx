,chloe560,2007-12-25T12:37Z,"Solution to solve 60 herz problem: 
Install PowerStrip, or another program with fix refreshing rate and run soldner in 60 herz first, then, enter in menu and load the level, after switch alt+tab on power strip and change refresh on any you want and play. But if you return in menu, this will be 60 herz error again, so you can only play in ant refresh but before you go in menu change refreh to 60 herz again. This no perfect solution, but this work."
