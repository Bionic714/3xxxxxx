,Ratbite,2007-12-14T10:38Z,Mr DJ_NRG! You must download and start your own torrent file to get seeding.
,DJ_NRG,2007-12-15T00:20Z,I don't know. I've created the torrent and its sitting in Transmission but nothing is happening. 
,darkerblonde,2007-12-16T15:59Z,when u wanna a seed a torrent from transmission ( wich is the very best and more efficient bit torrent client for mac ) just be sure that the file you are seeding is located in the same directory as you are downloading.....
