(Previous upload had bad index, if you snatched it fix with Digital Video Repair
http://www.risingresearch.com/en/dvr/ which is what I repaired this with.)

Profound movie about relationships and destiny: 10 stars! The director, Andrei Zvyagintsev, is well on his way to becoming the greatest Russian director of all time.

This is not a movie for shallow people looking for simple stories.
