[V],Slickinator,2007-12-27T16:13Z,"ok first off look for the PATCH file which is on the cd or iso and then extract it from the Zip file and then you copy that file you extracted from the zip file to the install folder where the monopoly was installed to   C:\Program Files\Hasbro\Monopoly by Parker Brothers  
and it will ask do you want to copy over the other file with this one you say yes and close everything down and your set too go hope this helps you out"

Well, Slickinators version is a whole ISO CD image it contains some big dummy files the game uses to determine if it's running an original CD - these are not needed if you install a ""no-cd patch"" anyway so why waste bandwidth? I only took what's needed - game installer and ""patch"" (I made installer to ""patch"" too - it auto-finds the game from registry and installs patched exe - no need to copy file manually). Whew :P"
,aladdin_sane,2008-03-05T17:02Z,"Ok where the instructions say to copy the file called ""no CD patch"", you don't just copy the file in to the directory, you extract the files in that folder into C:Program Files/Hasbromonopoly and then run the game and it works fine, thanks."
[V],Slickinator,2008-03-05T19:35Z,ok tell me why CJ_HNO  do you keep posting the same info in my torrent when you already have thanx but no thanks keep your torrent going and ill keep mine going do you see me telling everyone come over to mine its the best one as far as i know they both work so let everyone look and choose what they want thanx and have a nice day
,CJ_HNO,2008-03-05T23:30Z,"Hey man, relax :P I didn't say that one or other torrent is better, don't take offense on me :-) besides don't worry - ur torrent hv more than 10 times more seeders than my all the time :P i agree - it's not a competition or race - just more 2 choice from. peace man"

[V],Slickinator,2008-03-16T20:05Z,you have to explore the cd or iso mean extract the files or if you burned the cd just go to my computer then cee your cdrom drive RIGHT click on it not left click and when the little menu pops up scroll down or up to explore and in there you will see the patch folder and u will see the zip file and extract it and copy it where it needs to go

,Jebus_36o-gamer-tag-,2008-06-06T19:43Z,"Sorry Slickinator but CJ_HNO is right, your torrent is a waste of bandwidth when a 25MB exact copy of your torrent is available and is even easier to setup and install. I am only posting this because you tried to defend your torrent in his comment page when all he is doing is telling everyone that the is an easier way to get this game. If anyone want the faster easier torrent you can find it at 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4016216/Monopoly_2008_(Installer___No_CD_Patch)_ONLY_25_MB
It works perfect"

[V],Slickinator,2008-06-09T00:04Z,ok people why do you keep saying same stuff if people can read then they already know what has been said before plus i also have more seeds and mine was a complete rip just enjoy and stop saying stuff people already know i don't go and start bad mouthing a torrent just because of size diference if it works it works thats al that maters even if you say your not bad mouthing it your lying because all your saying is download someone elses hmm sounds like a bash to me 
[V],Slickinator,2008-06-09T00:08Z,kinda funy also Jebus_36o-gamer-tag-  your saying stuf and you have not uploaded a torent here at all once you upload something you can have room to talk oh and by the way i was not defending my torent just requesting he leave his torent links as i say to you out of my torrent people can search like anyone else 
,wiiboy16,2008-06-10T03:11Z,wtf is so many seedeers for it's dang monopoly game. trust me i play the board game and it bores me. a pc is made for shooters i guess ya should know that. i'm not comin off as an asshole sorry all
,ike74ph,2008-06-12T11:52Z,Hi. Can't get it to run. First time downloading a game. It always looks for the CD. How do I make it work? Thanks
,Jebus_36o-gamer-tag-,2008-06-14T13:28Z,"""kinda funy also Jebus_36o-gamer-tag- your saying stuf and you have not uploaded a torent here at all once you upload something you can have room to talk""
Oh I am sorry, I didn't realize I need to upload a torrent first before I can POST A FUCKING COMMENT. I think you will find if you click on most user names they will not have a torrent uploaded so what the fuck has that got to do with anything you 'tard! Your clearly just bitter that you can't shit all over a torrent I uploaded.

And another thing... if you wasn't stuck so far up your own ass you would of noticed that I pointed out not only the size difference in files but also that you don't need to mount it to disc like with your torrent.

So just to conclude in a simple format that an idiot like you can understand, his torrent is smaller (wastes less bandwidth) and also can just be installed straight to PC (wastes less time and discs)

And just to fuck you off more as punishment for your stupidity, here is that link again for anyone who wants it.

use a virtual drive program, i use daemon tools but there are others as well.

this game is only 25MB when installed, the rest off the size is padding on the cd image.

the crack is allready installed, all you have to do is unzip and play, and the torrent is only 18MB, not 205 like this one."
[V],Slickinator,2009-02-10T14:47Z,if you had to re format your computer because of a working game then i guess your system was screwed before hand thanx for trying but you failed DORK lol 100's of people get it working no problem some may have some trouble getting it to play because of not extracting the crack from the zip and putting it in to the installed directory where there is tons of comments on here explaining how to do it in many ways so just go through them and try them all out and find which way works for you frankly i just burn the cd and install and then extract the patch from zip and put where you know it goes and play easy as that

,Graylorde,2009-04-03T23:41Z,Why the hell is it padded?
,dr.bukkake,2009-04-15T21:32Z,ive tried downloading this and extracting the patch into the monopoly folder but im getting an accessed denied message...this is the first time ive done this so have no idea!
[V],Slickinator,2009-04-27T20:55Z,thats good for u the thing is i tell everyone that the game is an exact rip from an original nothing ripped from it and the reason that some games have padding is to read the disc faster because the padding pushes the data to the out part of the cd so it reads fast for smoother play thats why its bigger so don't say its not worth downloading because maybe someone wants the whole game on cd as is never know judge for your self and atleast i still have lots of seeders and Dr. make sure you don't have the game running or mounted when you copy of the cracked exe file as that might cause that and make sure it says yes to copy over the file and if still not right delete the main exe file from the folder and copy just the cracked one there by its self enjoy
