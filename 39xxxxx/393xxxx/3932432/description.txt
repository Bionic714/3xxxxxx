IMDB Review: I loved this show! How wonderful it is to finally see a program on television that features a gay male character in the lead(!) that isn't a stereotype. In fact, he breaks all stereotypes. John Goodman plays William "Butch" Gamble, a tough, macho, masculine guy who also happens to be gay. He stands up for himself when verbally attacked and he likes football too. When is the last time a gay character on television or in the movies had all of those qualities?
