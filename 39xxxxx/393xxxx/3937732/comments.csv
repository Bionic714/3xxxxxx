,hotrod79,2008-01-19T01:19Z,"bobrequa: Maybe you're to stupid to follow a documentary that doesn't follow the standard ""shoot a bunch of shit, get some public domain archive footage and some actor to do a voice over to explain wtf you're looking at."" 

The film maker covers this event and does an excellent job of it. I've always wanted to go, and after watching this I now know what it's like and feel in some way I've experienced it. 

Seriously don't let this asshat stop you from enjoying this movie. It's well made and provides an interesting insight to alternative American culture."
