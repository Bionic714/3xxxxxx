,demee007,2008-01-01T09:27Z,"Thanks, but why is ""The Rosary Vendetta"" only 20 seconds long?

It's supposed to be over 2 minutes. Are there other problems like this?"
,tarlar,2008-01-04T04:28Z,"There are 4 versions of this song: normal, no choir, short choir and short orch, have you searched properly (disc 1 abbey road)?"
,Smashing666,2008-01-22T17:21Z,"It took two whole days to download this massive file, but sadly some of the files are distorted (90% of Epic III) :( Can I maybe download Epic III alone, instead of downloading the whole file again? Please advice"
,pwn247,2008-02-02T12:39Z,Any more seeders? 
,Martenzo,2008-06-11T19:28Z,"Well, I've found that although some songs repeat on different albums, there are also differences in some songs. more specifically, are there two versions of the song Epicon on different albums? Because I've heard one version I really like on a youtube video, but the versions of Epicon in here are not that good."
,arsenal1001,2008-07-24T21:43Z,"hey, im downloading this cuz i heard Heaven's Warriors online and liked it.

which part of this download has all the epic war sounding tracks?

u know, like they play in lord of the rings and 300 and all the war movies, before two large armies clash?"
,tarlar,2008-10-08T02:56Z,"If you want the more epic stuff, download Themes for Orchestra and Choir 1 & 2, those are easily the best."
,pietastesgood,2008-12-29T18:09Z,Eh. Where's track 2 on action and drama 4?
