VLC works the best for me!

The lyrics flow with the imagery on the screen. I tried to keep all the imagery time-specific with the release of Paul's Boutique--so nothing before July 25, 1989.

Not all the video segments are exact matches to the lyrics, but they are poetic matches.

If you have any suggestions for better segments, contact me. All forms of media accepted: movies, television shows, magazines, newspaper photos, etc.

Peace out,
