,captainbeeky,2008-03-03T17:59Z,dose any one have a crack file for this
,sansa12354,2008-05-20T05:05Z,"I am a programmer and if anyone wants too we can work on this together and create a patch, once I have it working i can create an auto patcher where all you have to do is run the patcher enter you serial # and model #(ex. 605, 604, 405, etc) and it will patch it for you.

Right now we need to find a way to read the contents with least amount of jibberish.

Anyone welcome, leave a message on here or leave ur email. I will check here often."

,BrodieCSX,2008-06-18T01:53Z,"I am also looking for a crack file for this. I have 
The cinema plug-in
The podcast plug-in
The web browser plug-in

All .aos file type and all do not work on my Archos 605 because they need some kind of crack"
,BrodieCSX,2008-06-18T04:14Z,"By the way, there is already a large group of people working on this. I BELIEVE all of their work is posted here: http://forum.archosfans.com/viewtopic.php?p=96317#96317"
,BrodieCSX,2008-06-18T22:56Z,"Ok, so i've checked my research again and from my understanding: Every Archos device contains all of the plug-ins already. The plug-in that you download is simply the activation method for that Archos ability. The plug is encryped with 1024 bit encryption. Every plug is unique and will only work for one device. So in order to crack this file, you would first need to break 1024 bit encryption - which when it comes down to it, really is not worth it when you could just BUY the plug for a few dollars.

I don't like buying things either... but I'll make an exception this time... I have a contact that can get me all of the plugs for $40 because he buys them from a different country.

This is the last post I will make on the matter, I will not be checking back here."
,elextro,2008-07-06T12:28Z,"At the moment I am trying to crack it with my friend, with have found some hidden files which don't show up even when you set it to be recognized as a HDD. I will not be letting out any information about this project but will. Post my progress here."
,Xris22,2008-09-22T06:46Z,"Archos pulled once of the shittiest tricks I've ever experienced buying white-goods/hardware ever... in selling a nice piece of multimedia hardware with full audio/video compatibility... but asking for MORE money (the gadget is not cheap to begin with) to switch on it's full functionality (MPEG, AVI etc.)

THAT is a totally greedy/shitty trick Archos!!!!! Frickin money-grabbers. Why not just be fair and put the price of the BIOS/pre-loaded renderers in the final package? Oh yeah... it's looks cheaper without the added price of the missing drivers....

They did pretty much the same shitty trick with the actual hardware capability too... you need to pay a (not so small) fortune to buy the interfaces to access the (already built-in) recording and socket functionality. SHAME ON YOU Archos!!!

Anywoot... beefing aside, as ac0de mentioned, the drivers are indeed bound to your own unique Product Key. And as gomzi suggests, you need to first update your firmware to minimum Firmware Update v1.6.23 for the newly bought codecs to work.

Greaaaaaaat device... but the hidden costs should be taken to the obudsman... It's like selling a car with the (personally keyed) heating switch removed and the trunk key withheld until you cough up more money. I can almost understanding them asking more for the hardware interfacing (most corporate bullies have been doing that for a long time) but actually omitting a part of the OS/BIOS to charge extra for it is worse than even the likes of Sony have ever come up with).

Beef and double-beef over. Peace all ^^

I've never heard of any available cracks for this, and I'm not sure if I would be happy applying cracks to this BIOS... even their own Firmware Update v1.6.23 is non-reversible. So BE CAREFUL people..."
,gold167,2009-04-24T00:03Z,"Someones got to have come up with something??

This doesnt work - Archos 404 H264 & AAC Video Podcast Plugin-MECCA doesnt work someone must have created a crack or keygen which generates the code"
