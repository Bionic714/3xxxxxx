Verjnuarmu is a Finnish band playing a style of melodic death metal they call Savo metal. In proper Finnish, the band's name would be "Verinaarmu".

Savo metal is not a proper heavy metal subgenre; the term refers to the fact that the music of Verjnuarmu is metal with the lyrics written in Savo, an Eastern Finnish dialect. The usage of Savo can be considered as the gimmick of Verjnuarmu, since most Finnish heavy metal groups write their lyrics in English, and it is very exceptional that Finnish language lyrics in any style of music are recognizable as a specific dialect. In the spirit of typical Savonian humour, some people boast that Verjnuarmu is the first and only musical group in the world playing Savo metal.

According to Viitakemies, one of the guitarists of the band, their greatest influences musically are death metal, traditional heavy metal and traditional folk music. Their full-length debut album Muanpiällinen Helevetti was released on January 25, 2006 under Universal Music Finland.
