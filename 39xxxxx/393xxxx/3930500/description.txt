Standup Comedy - Doug Stanhope - 7 Albums mp3

Stanhope?s material is marked by an almost unflinching honesty, touching upon his own drug habits and sexual habits. His social and political views are contrarian, but always sincere. The twisted things he says are what he believes, he?s come to them using his own dark logic. His belief in what he says - it?s not just ?material? - is probably why sometimes he gets visceral responses from audiences, often inducing walkouts not ready for the truth as Stanhope sees it.

Stanhope often draws comparisons to Bill Hicks and Lenny Bruce, but he mostly doesn?t see it.
