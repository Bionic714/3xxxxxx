Alright, it seems as though A LOT of people are looking for 
a WORKING version of ""AVG Antivirus 8.0 + Internet Security"".

There are people who have 8.0 available for download, but NONE
of them have a WORKING firewall...

Everyone is looking for the 8.0 + firewall
download, but nobody knows where
to get it.

ANYONE CAN GET AVG 8.0, BUT I HAVE YET TO FIND A VERSION 
THAT COMES WITH A LEGIT AND WORKING FIREWALL.

Someone! Please, help us out!
AVG 8.0 with working firewall is in VERY, VERY high demand!!!
