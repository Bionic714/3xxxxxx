You will need it to some of the .pdf files.

Anyone having video problems i suggest using ""VLC media player""- google search that- excellent free video player with no need to download extra codecs. 

Props to the uploader- this stuff is golden, i reccomend this torrent to all."

Can someone please explain how and where to put in the password or this torrent is usless."
