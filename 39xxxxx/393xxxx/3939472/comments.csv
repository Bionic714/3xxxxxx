,tripmix,2009-04-08T11:27Z,"Thanks. Just a note, all episodes are there. However 10 is the same as 11 and in 10 the last 15min or so are corrupt. So just skip 10 and go right for 11 when you are watching."
,m66k,2009-07-01T11:31Z,Thank you donmcn!
,GhastlyGrinner,2010-09-17T23:29Z,There are no subtitles. Why do you lie?
,harvey_weinstein,2010-10-12T04:50Z,"Episode 10 has really bad audio at the 30 min. mark. It's undecipherable until the end of the episode. Audio on that one is 1 out of 10. Other than that, the series is great, no problems."
,harvey_weinstein,2010-10-12T04:51Z,"Ah, missed the comment above from tripmix. Thanks for pointing that out, they are indeed the same. 11 is perfect."
