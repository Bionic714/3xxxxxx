          During the concert, Alice in Chains drew from their three albums and two EPs,        
          offering new, more reflective arrangements for harder songs like \"Would?\" and        
          virtually re-creating the original versions of \"Got Me Wrong\" and \"No Excuses.\"      
          Throughout the album, the group sounds tight and professional.
