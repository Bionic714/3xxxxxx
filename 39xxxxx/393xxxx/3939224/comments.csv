,jpp4256,2008-01-01T15:04Z,"The message of this document is complete bullshit. According to this dokument porn destroys your life and eventually makes you to kill your girlfriend. 

Composers of this crap doesn't seem to know anything about porn or jerking off. There is a guy claiming that he masturbates 30-40 hours every week having 4-5 orgasms per hour. rrright....

Fake characters, fake interviews, etc... Barely worth of watching. "
,jesterofhate,2008-02-22T02:32Z,"For the record, pornography can ruin your life.  My wife just left me because of it, and now I am lonely and depressed.  I'm not going to say it's evil, because some people have no problem with it.  But it can be very addicting if you don't realize it, and it can make you do things you wouldn't want to do.  similar to drugs and alcohl.  all things in moderation, but some things are easier to moderate then others."
,Chavista,2008-03-23T10:27Z,"your wife did not leave you because of porn. your wife left you because your relationship collapsed, and you used porn as your escape (of course there are a million ways I could be wrong...well, if it were gay porn for one)."
,ukobert,2008-10-26T01:07Z,please seed. Tired of being 95% done. 
,BaseClass,2009-02-07T03:58Z,"I'm downloading this for a friend. He constantly downloads porn, catalogues his films and his collection must be over 3.000 films. I've noticed over the years that his choices of what to download have become more brutal and sick. He always checks my torrents so I'm going to leave this up as a gentle reminder. 

Let's face the facts - you have to be a ""pure tit and arsehole"" to think that the people who work for the ISP's who have daughters don't keep track of their customers who search and download porn titles."
,mailnotwanted,2009-06-02T11:29Z,your wife should kill you for wanking off to porn!
,Hadrianpublius,2010-12-24T03:14Z,"I've noticed that the more you watch porn the more you get bored of it and need 'more extreme' forms of it. That's why I've totally cut it out of my life..I wanna be a human being with some sense of honour..be a friggin man,have a normal relationship with a woman and don't let these Illuminati c***suckers destroy your soul."
