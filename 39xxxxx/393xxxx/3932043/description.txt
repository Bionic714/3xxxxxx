\"ALIENS VS. PREDATOR - REQUIEM\" SYNOPSIS

In ALIENS VS. PREDATOR REQUIEM (AVP-R), the iconic creatures from two of the scariest film franchises in movie history wage their most brutal battle ever -- in our own backyard

The science fiction-action-thriller captures the magic of the Alien vs. Predator comics, novels and videogames that established the AVP brand while paying homage to the hallmarks of the film series that preceded it: Ridley Scotts seminal work of science fiction and horror, Alien; James Camerons masterpiece of intense action, Aliens; and John McTiernans thriller about an extra-terrestrial warrior wreaking havoc in the jungle, Predator. At the same time AVP-R, introduces an intriguing element new to the franchise, by having the Aliens and Predator wage war in a small American town
First 5 Minutes peeps, have fun for a moment:P
