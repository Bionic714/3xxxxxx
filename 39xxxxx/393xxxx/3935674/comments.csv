,fuzzoo,2008-11-17T03:06Z,Rhino plug-in works as long as you have a SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE that points to maxwell and not a USER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE.  Google these terms if you don't know what they are.......
,sodidrank,2008-11-30T23:59Z,"Anyone have the Solidworks x64 plugin for Vista?  The one i am using is having a problem with the MXI crashing.

Don't you think that posting a link related to the subject would be helpful to the non-nerdy people be more effective than asking them to search something they know nothing about????"
,georgess,2009-10-05T16:19Z,"Hello Yellowgowild, I too can't seem to find any exe files etc as stated in the read me. Any ideas on this, downloaded twice and installed twice but maxwell is a trial version at the mo for me.

,flipmatik,2009-11-27T23:43Z,"for those having a problem with a plug-in. first make sure that you have the proper service release installed. i believe the newest is SR6. if you dont have it, you can search for it . then to make sure you have the proper SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE follow the instructions on this website. -> http://www.itechtalk.com/thread3595.html . 

fuzzo was right. you have a USER environment  variable. now you have to add a NEW systems environment variable.  the variable & it's value should be the same as the one in the User Environment Variable.

you should be set after that"
