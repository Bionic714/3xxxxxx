This is a Ron Paul dvd I created after some comments I heard about how the casual viewer might not have the patience to sit through the other RP dvds out there. This dvd contains the following:

Our Power, Our Responsibility- (This is the popular antiwar/rp video clip from youtube)

A New Hope 2.0 (A popular youtube video by eLiberty)

Google Candidates Ron Paul (This is about a 1 hour interview w/ Ron Paul by Google)

Ron Paul History (This is an older congressional ad talking about his life story)
