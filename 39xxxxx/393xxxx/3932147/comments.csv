If you don't mind I'd like to have the  max 3d sdk."
[T],d-l33t3,2007-12-13T15:28Z,"It's not the max 3d sdk. That was a typo. I have the blitz 3d sdk and the tv3d sdk for blitz max. 
Check my profile in a couple of days. I will add both once torrents I'm working on are established. "
[T],d-l33t3,2007-12-13T15:37Z,"Just to add, the blitz 3d sdk can be included in blitz max programs to give blitz 3d funtionality."
,s128064,2007-12-15T14:13Z,"YES, upload the blitz3d SKD too please, excellent stuff!"
[T],d-l33t3,2007-12-16T02:35Z,"Done. Blitz 3D SDK torrent is here.

You are right, this is rare as heck. I have looked for this several times and I finally have it! I was just about to spend the $80 to buy this software ( I Literally had the blitz website up on the next firefox tab over, ready to buy the damn thing.)

I have been using TPB for a long time now and have never registerd with the site..Until Now. I would just pirate and then be on my marry way. But dude, THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!"

I love this language and its ease of use and I believe it was 80 bucks well spent. :)
(But that's me :P)"
