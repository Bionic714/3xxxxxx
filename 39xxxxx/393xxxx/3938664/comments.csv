,dirty_cousin,2008-02-13T19:42Z,sweet dude thanks.  Been looking forever to find a david wilcox discography torrent.  No luck...:(.  I would download this but I have the over 60 minutes with wilcox album and it has these songs on there.  Why isn't he more popular he's freaking awesome.  Like you said excellent bar music he rocks!
,DDDamian,2008-02-29T23:27Z,Wish I had more to post - pulled these off LimeWire.  If anyone can help complete a discography here on TPB I'm sure you'd find takers!
,dirty_cousin,2008-03-01T21:53Z,Do you know the best way to spread the word about it?  I'm kinda new to this so any pointers would be appreciated.  Keep on rocking in the free world!
,MissMuffet,2008-03-06T07:06Z,"Does anyone know if this has Strong Chemistry on it from his album Big horizon? I've looked all the fuck over for it, and it's like the damn song doesn't exist. :("

,DDDamian,2009-05-15T14:44Z,Photo and album list are not by me. Glad to see this torrent is still alive and well - means there's fans out there. Will keep checking and seeding from time to time...DDDamian
,dirty_cousin,2009-06-13T21:34Z,"Fuckin' eh.  I always recommend Wilcox and always send them here cuz like I said before it's impossible to find his stuff.  Sad really.  

But yeah there is 2 David Wilcox's.  Canadian blues rocker and American jazzist.

The one pictured is American just to clear things up."
,Major Kong,2009-09-21T05:12Z,"Thanks for this collection.  

I saw Wilcox on August 01,2009 at The Queen's in Port Elgin.  it wwas an outdoor affair with over 800 people attending.  He really played well and his licks were top notch.  It surprised me that he only had a bassist and drummer as backup.  Anyway, I was impressed.

Here's a good page to check out with a link to his site at the bottom.
