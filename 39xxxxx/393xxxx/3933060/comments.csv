My hard drive is only 80GB. For some reason people tend to .rar their files, when i open it, it is like having 2 copies of the same size. So I usually delete the .rar to make room for more downloads. 
i dont understand the point of making them that way in the first place, the unpacked file is usually close to the same size as the compressed file.
 Anyway, if you think its fake, then download someone else's copy, this one atleast has the subs already on the film. I downloaded it from leetay. if you're leary about mine then DL leetay's and unpack it yourself, and have 1.5GB of the same movie on your drive.

,Italian_Banker,2007-12-14T19:16Z,"knighty, fuck you. 
I downloaded this file and it had leetay in the file name. it was a .rar and i unpacked it and deleted the .rar file. i hate the files that are like that, i dont get the point since it isnt compressed much more than the uncompressed size. this was the second copy i downloaded looking for one with the english subs in the movie. i tried using avisub on another copy that came with the subs in an .srt file. it didn't work so i deleted it and found leetay's. perhaps someone else .rar'd it and reuploaded. regardless it is excellent quality so go to leetay's downloads and get it if you want. there is some green text part way up the page, don't click on it if you dont believe it is real.

,itchino1,2007-12-15T15:54Z,Whatever Mr Banker Ive never known leetay to use a rar file always avi I think you seek attention.
,Italian_Banker,2007-12-17T06:54Z,"Just trying to give back. I do do it because i think people are too stupid to use winrar, I can't keep the .rar file too long as i said they are the same size as the unpacked file. One 700MB .rar unpacked becomes 1400MB. If I'm not doing anyone any favors then it wouldn't have been downloaded. And yes I have already asked santa for an external hard drive, something around 1TB. "
,Italian_Banker,2007-12-17T06:55Z,"""I do do it because i think..""

I meant ""don't do it..."" sorry."
