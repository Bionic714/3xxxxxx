All I need to know is how?

Or can you do a couple of Talk Talk cd's...Thanks anyway"

The music brings back some old favorites, and the mix is actually, very good.

Now if we can only get some funk going, like Ohio Players, James Brown, Kool & the Gang, or Hot Chocolate, all in DTS...

Thank for an excellent Upmix."
