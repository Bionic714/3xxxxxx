I don't know how this could be a real DVD rip."
,VeganFreak,2008-01-16T20:39Z,"zorgkang - I didn't rip this myself, but the quality of it most definitely is a real DVD rip (it's not like people could remove the subs if they were hard-coded into the movie). I don't think the original authors included spanish subs for the short spanish part (30 seconds of the whole movie?), since there obviously isn't any as it was produced without them originally afaik, and that shouldn't be a big deal keeping someone from enjoying this fine DVD ripped movie anyway. 

When you play real DVD's you sometimes have the option of using subs (turning it off and on), but this is just an xvid .avi file with no xvid subtitle support, you could expect that if you read the details of this torrent before downloading. None should be needed anyway since this movie is 99.99% English and most people can decipher what the spanish guy was saying when he briefly spoke anyway, and even if you can't no big deal (i can't do anything about your displeasure in the way this movie was authored). If you know of a better version then feel free to upload it yourself and leave a comment here with the url to that better version, but i don't think there's anything ""missing"" from this movie as you claim there to be."
,kraxz,2008-04-16T05:57Z,"I saw this on DVD (real one not pirate) and if I remember right there was some text missing then as well.. Not the subtitles (of course) but other like them titles between chapters.. Kinda weird.. I know I have also seen a version with the text there, that I think i downloaded from DC.. If I find it again I upload here, promise.

Anyways great movie that all should see text or not, I will keep seeding."

,machbar,2010-02-14T06:53Z,"FROM THE FILMMAKER: Why bother download this version when the complete film with all on-screen text, is available as a torrent, distributed by the filmmakers themselves? We included complete subtitles for all Spanish spoken in the film. 

We would have had no reason to release this ""titleless"" version to the public, (and I know of no DVD distributor who would, and I'd sure like to know where it came from). This version would be used to supply distributors and broadcasters of non-English language versions of the film so they can insert titles in their country's language. 

Without all the text you'll miss quite a bit. Like the names of the 40 interview subjects and what they do for starters. There's all kinds of other textual information throughout the film that is essential to understanding it. Please download a different version than this.

If you like the film and can support our outreach efforts, please go to www.thecorporation.com and make a contribution. Thanks.

,dannychris,2010-04-09T11:57Z,"The Corporation is a 2003 Canadian documentary film written by Joel Bakan, and directed by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott. The documentary is critical of the modern-day corporation, considering its legal status as a class of person and evaluating its behaviour towards society and the world at large as a psychiatrist might evaluate an ordinary person. This is explored through specific examples. The Corporation has been displayed worldwide, on television, and via DVD, file sharing, and free download. Bakan wrote the book, The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power, during the filming of the documentary.

Thank you for an honest and heartfelt comment on this production of yours (and your team's) and for taking the time to contact us in the community.

I have tried before to get ahold of productions like this through ""normal"" channels and wasted hours being frustrated not finding them because they're not ""meant for my market"".

After trying Kelkoo (on your suggestion through your site) and failing, I did manage to find this (2-disc version) on www.cdon.se and for the low cost of 5â‚¬. I was more than happy to pay that money and I'm looking forward to this arriving in the mail in the next few days :)

I hope it's as good as it seems. One of the reasons to download the material before buying it is of course to not get disappointed with the purchases.

With your permission I'd like to share it with the rest of the community, linking back to the official site and your ""Donate""-page. That way you could get paid without any middle-men. Or why not do it yourself? :)"
