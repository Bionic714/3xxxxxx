,coke_beard,2007-12-27T23:17Z,"I downloaded and installed and everything and I have a few questions.

the mcafee icon at the bottom right is gray and says 'virus scan disabled' when you rollover it. I went into settings and enabled it and I verified subscription but no go.

when you right click the icon, the dropdown for antivirus is just ""-"".

I can't find antispyware under the list of programs. the dropdown for antispyware is there but nothing happens when you click scan or settings

I'm using XP"
