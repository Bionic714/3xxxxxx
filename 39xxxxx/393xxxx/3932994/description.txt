A direct-to-DVD-R presentation, this really isn't very good at all! It's more of a curiosity piece and an ego stroke for its creator/host than an actual quality presentation, although if you wanted to learn some repetitive athletic things to do with a basketball (besides, you know, PLAYING BASKETBALL), this video would fit the bill. 23 min., 36 sec.
