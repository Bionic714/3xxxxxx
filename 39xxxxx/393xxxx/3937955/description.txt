Canadian trio Cobblestone Jazz use early computers and analog synths to create sounds which combine the quality of improvisational jazz with a minimal, dancefloor aesthetic. Their music is created in one take, either culled from live performances or studio mixes. \"23 Seconds,\" a double CD, feautes 10 brand new tracks on CD1, while CD2 highlights their amazing live set recorded at Mondo in Madrid May 2007, as well as their two previous club hits, \"Dump Truck,\" and \"India in Me,\" which appear here on CD for the first time.
