 This second adaptation of Richard Metheson\'s science-fiction novel, I Am Legend, the first being, The Last Man On Earth, unfolds in a post-apocalyptic 1976. Charlton Heston is Robert Neville, the sole recipient of a serum that enabled him to survive an onslaught of germ warfare between Russia and China - which seemingly rendered him the last \"normal\" human alive. Neville lives in a garnish, antique strewn L.A. penthouse. During the day, he roams through the vacatn city. At night, he fends off a bloodthirsty horde of mutant scavengers garbed in Spanish inquisition robes and sunglasses, led by Matthias, a former television newscaster in his good ol\' premutant days. Matthias and his half-human vampires want to kill Neville. Neville\'s last man on Earth status is shattered when he comes across a group of young people, presided over by a sexy and cynical Lisa.
