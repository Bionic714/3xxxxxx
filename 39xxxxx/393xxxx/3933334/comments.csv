,g25racer,2008-02-13T01:54Z,"That serial doesnt work!! I fixed it so you wont get the trial version thing poping up or the upgrade thing if your still using the trial. Go to My computer, Hard drive, Program files, then Sound Spectrum, then whitecap. Then go to resources and delete License.dat and Resources.sstome!! Make sure you restart media player and the visualizer in order to take effect. You will get a little error reading at the top every once in a while but its better than the trila thing poping up all the time!"
,Miscreant_Stapler,2008-02-13T01:55Z,A serial that go rid of that trial version notifier would be good.
,g25racer,2008-02-13T05:23Z,That would be good! I'll keep people updated maybe i can figure something out and maybe edit the license file or something!
,viviteuf,2008-03-12T13:44Z,All right just desactiv chek for uptades ;)

,pixie1966,2008-03-17T15:21Z,Deactivate update checks? :O How? o.o
,xXSketchXx,2008-03-20T00:39Z,"great program, works fine, but same prob with every1 else, trial + upgrade keeps popping up. i dont mind it that much but a fix would be nice =D"
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2008-04-09T19:18Z,Hope this helps a little... Someone in the softskies post...which is another soundspectrum app. said that he got the key to work by deleting some files and then reinstalling the program after disabling internet access. Ill try it out for this one.
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2008-04-09T19:49Z,it might be in the start/c:/program files/soundspectrum/whitecap/scrips/startup. You might have to delete that file. Hope that helps.
,opeth51,2008-05-02T02:06Z,why does this version tell me that it is a trial version?
,opeth51,2008-05-02T02:07Z,o. lol. nvm. srry bout that g25racer. tnx for that
,gamerspowers,2008-05-14T14:38Z,"I KNOW THE WAY TO DELETE THE TRAIL THING! 

uninstall.
disable your internet connection.
install.
go to settings-->check for updates-->never.
shut down computer.
restart and put your internet on again.

it should work now,it did for me."
