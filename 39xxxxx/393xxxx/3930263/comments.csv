,asidonhopo,2008-05-25T14:15Z,"AGV says the crack has ""Trojan Horse downloader Agent ACJN"""
,centime,2008-09-21T03:20Z,"Installed, applied crack, overwrote file, started game, still demo version.  Crack didn't work?  Why not?  I know how to apply a crack, and even though I went back and did it again just to make sure, it just gives me the demo.  When I click on ""already paid"", it asks for reg number.

cryssorel, a little help?  I would appreciate it.  Thanks."

So yeah, it works fine, and no viruses.  *rolls eyes*  I can be pretty dumb...

But the link above IS still useless.  That comment still stands."
