Here is what has been fixed/ enhanced with SP2:

- Fixed barometer switch problem
- Improved clickability on AFS buttons ( although some still report problems I am still looking into this ) 
- Improved quality on the main panel guages ( HDI, RMI, Brake pressure, Flight director buttons ) They now correctly fit in panel. 
- Some minor 3D parts added on VC main panel ( HDI, RMI , STBY ALT ) 
- Improved spoiler deployment handle and flap handle
- Improved main panel texture in VC
- Improved main 2D panel BMP
- Added a new panel light ( the actual light itself )
- Fixed the VC night texture alpha problem ( textures had different alpha channels )
- VC guages in pedestal now have back lighting ( I missed that one before ) 
- Added moving rudder pedals ( oops should have done that in the beginning )
- VC rain affects are fixed
- The texture problem with the A332 nose is now fixed. 
- Also added chrono button to VC
- More wingflex
- Adjusted exterior lighting


Enjoy.
