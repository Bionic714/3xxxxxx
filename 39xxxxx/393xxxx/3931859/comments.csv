,riplikethat,2008-06-06T19:53Z,NO offense but this is the gayest shit I have ever heard. WTF was he wailing on about? Sounded like he needed to take a crap or something..
,tmboyz,2008-08-03T04:37Z,"shankjunk! superb effort!! will you have more of these? rare old stuff from the likes of TK Pattammal and Honnappa Bagavadhar. Honnappa was the stand in for MKT when the latter was away in jail for 2yrs. In those days as a vocalist MKT was peerless, possibly matched only by SG Kittappa. FYI, Kittappa was the husband of KB Sundarambal. Some bit of history here.!"
