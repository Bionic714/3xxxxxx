,Leib,2007-12-13T17:21Z,Uploader/initial seeder seems to have abandoned the ship after only 1 day. Will try downloading from the numerous peers. Maybe there is 100% from amongst all of them. Will give update by tomorrow 12/14 if this is going or not and what exactly this is. It seems strange that a DVD would have been first released in Holland rather than the US where the film orginated.
,Leib,2007-12-13T17:31Z,"Correction, there are no seeders only 4 hours after the upload. Well, if I can gleen 100% from everyone else and this is real, then I'll remain to seed it for a day or so."
,Leib,2007-12-13T18:28Z,1 seeder now. Stay tuned...
,drprozac2000,2007-12-13T23:25Z,Its an AVI
,lukevn,2007-12-15T01:06Z,"Everyone stuck at 63.9% for over 9 hours already.  

Did anyone get 100%?

Is this fake?"
,schloapkop,2007-12-15T13:44Z,"Yep, stuck at 63,9%!! Linday1, where's the missing part?????????????????????????
