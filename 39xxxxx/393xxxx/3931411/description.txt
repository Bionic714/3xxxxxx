  Embarrassing TV talent show auditions that proves there's a multitude of
    losers for every winner. Those featured include cheesy duo Spirit and
    Destiny who had to be escorted off by security after rejection on The X
    Factor, and an action man whose stunt went horribly wrong on America's
    Got Talent and the 87-year-old mother-in-law who famously stood up to
    Simon Cowell. Narrated by Fearne Cotton, with contributions from Louis
    Walsh, Neil Fox, David Ian and Pete Waterman
