Reporter Jane Corbin examines the dark heart of Basra, once Iraq's most cosmopolitan city but now a place where women are murdered for wearing bright clothes, where being the wrong kind of Muslim can lead to your torture and where corruption is rife. As British forces prepare to finally hand over security control of the last province in southern Iraq, Corbin meets the new police chief of Basra - a man determined to restore law and order.
