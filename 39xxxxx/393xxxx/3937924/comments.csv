,SwiiFF,2008-03-22T04:01Z,"Well, Crynsos. That is not exactly true;

Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI are featured in the North American edition, while Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V are in the PAL region edition."

,GamesoulMaster,2008-10-06T19:32Z,"Does anybody know what image format these discs are in? I tend to stay away from ISO and BIN/CUE formats whenever possible (lacks subcode that some games need to play properly on some emulators), but it seems to be quite common regardless. Basically, I'm hoping these are MDS/MDF or CCD/IMG/SUB.

If people would include, for future reference, the basic information on these files, that would be wonderful. If this was music or a movie, everybody would have a fit that there isn't more information, and there shouldn't be a double standard for games."
