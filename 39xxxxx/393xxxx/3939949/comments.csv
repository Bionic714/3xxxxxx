,worryman,2007-12-20T01:43Z,"First,
This does not work. The ""patch"" that is included does not unlock the product.

Second,
The upload is double packed and the .rar file is passworded.

Last,
The uploader is not seeding."
,deochar,2007-12-20T09:31Z,I second that: the uploader is not seeding.
,ivorthegood,2007-12-20T13:34Z,"it is true, not seeding stuck at 88.7% shame really, joker1971 normaly has good working ups"
,jokeri1971,2007-12-20T17:51Z,first of all the patch works fine read the text i am using this software my self second read the pass text thats the password for the winrar file what a noobs u are and i am uploading it now for 2 days so do not complain ok
,jokeri1971,2007-12-20T18:09Z,rar pass is www.softarchive.net and i test the torrent my self it dont stuck on 88 % so dont talk any shit
,deochar,2007-12-20T20:40Z,"Take it easy buddy. 
We are just stating what we have experienced."
,ivorthegood,2007-12-21T19:07Z,"mate no one is being nasty, i certainly respect your ups and have said so.
can i just say the program works 100% but for those of you that follow instructions to the letter
1. install the program first
2. run the patch 
3. fully functioning just like joker 1971 said!"
,pruiz2006,2007-12-23T23:26Z,"Doesnt work for mee either! Downloaded, installed, ran patch. Not working."
,tsl77,2007-12-27T10:11Z,"I got no probs using the program. However the newletter count is still active. Which means that you only have 100 newletters to send in the trial.

Can this be deactivated with this copy of the software?"
,pruiz2006,2007-12-28T06:25Z,That's exactly what is happening with me... Download is great. but limited to 100 but with little glitches...
,tsl77,2008-01-06T09:28Z,"Does anyone got a crack for this, otherwise this application is useless unless bought :)"
,brewsnbytes,2008-01-17T13:55Z,Hi everyone. Any luck with a crack for the 100 letter limitation? It's a great program otherwise. Thanx. JX
,danielzager,2008-03-23T19:05Z,"The Crack dont working, i have tried many times now. I need a serial to this program, if you have mail me to danielzager@hotmail.com"
,amority,2008-05-23T11:32Z,"Good program with lot of oppurtunities. BUT the patch is not unlock limit of sending emails as it told before, 100 emails. I need to send more than that.

If I can unlock this 100 limit then 10 points for this upload."
,daryl22,2008-06-20T06:57Z,"Without unlocking the 100 email limit, you may as well link this torrent to the demo download.

Crackers we need your help on this one!"
,maximum-power,2008-09-08T13:14Z,You suck jokeri1971. This is just a demo. The patch doesn't work. 
,sdpeavey,2008-10-01T00:49Z,"yep, i hate to dissapoint but.  i waited like everyone else just to find out that the patch does start up the program but when you go to send the email it tells you that you can only send 100  (ok, cool I guess i'll have to send them out in groups of 100)
after sending the frist 100 I went back in to send the next group and it told me that I had one email left and wanted me to buy the software....opps, guess the patch didn't patch anything.  nice try uploader....next time test before seeding."
,MrWhizz,2008-10-18T19:37Z,"I think that I can solve part of the problem.

First of all the password to the Winrar files is www.softarchive.net. That was not clear to me at all from Jokers notes"
,MrWhizz,2008-10-20T11:54Z,"The patch still does not work. But if you revert your PC to an earlier time then you get another 100 newsletters.

Its a great piece of software but its a pain without the patch"
,LoonyJ,2009-05-13T19:49Z,"Has everyone tried running the patch from the install directory of Newsletter Studio? Maybe you are not running it as administrator(for those that use Vista)? Some people have even had to run patches in Safe Mode before it would work properly. Try a bunch of different options before thinking, ""This torrent sucks. It doesn't work for me, so it doesn't work for anyone. I'll just talk shit, rather than ask for help.""

Excellent torrent, btw. Works like a charm."
,pajson,2009-08-19T17:52Z,"It is still not working for me.

I have XP and I ran it even from the install dir without success. :("
,S3nd41,2009-12-07T20:20Z,"So, any serials for this? The ""patch"" is useless without one."
,S3nd41,2009-12-24T20:54Z,Hello? Patch doesn't work... anyone?
,rbmonfort,2010-06-01T09:26Z,looks like joderi1971 is idiot in this one!
,slicer357,2010-06-18T02:57Z,This is a great app. Does anyone have a crack or work around to the 100 email limit?
,S3nd41,2010-12-06T11:57Z,"Don't download this, crack doesn't work."
