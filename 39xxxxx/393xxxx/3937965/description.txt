          More than anything, Korn are about sound. They write songs, but those wind up not    
          being nearly as memorable as their lurching metallic hip-hop grind. They have yet to 
          exhaust that sound, and that's why their third album, Follow the Leader, is an       
          effective follow-up to their first two alt-metal landmarks. Not that it offers       
          anything new -- it's the same sound, offered in a more focused forum than Life Is    
          Peachy, but not sounding as fresh as Korn. In fact, it begins to wear a little thin  
          toward the end of the album, but guitarists Head Welch and Munky Shaffer find enough 
          tonal variations over the course of the album to keep it interesting, and vocalist   
          Jonathan Davis nearly matches them with his cavalcade of voices. If the songs        
          themselves don't leave much of an impression, it's because they're not supposed to --
          they're simply vehicles for the metallic grind, which provides all the visceral rush 
          any Korn fan needs.
