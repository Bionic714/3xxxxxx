Here is another new episode...sorry if its take time to get new episodes..the show is only on air 2-3 times a month..and then again, most of them are old, not news.
English dub, no subs, ads are again here.

The next 2 new episodes that I\\\\\\\'m gonna upload will be Asian Tsunami and the When the Volcano Blew ones...both are aired at December 31th at 3pm and 6pm. The other episodes between today and that day are old, like the Collision on the runway, Crash of the Concorde, the Everglade plane crash and the Sioux City plane crash, I guess you have all of those, no need to record it

I hope i can get all of the episodes from all 3 seasons, so it will be a nice collection :)
