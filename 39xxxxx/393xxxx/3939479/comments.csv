,notsy_tpb,2008-07-12T11:00Z,Sound doesn't seem to work on this file. Video is heavily compressed. Try the other one listed in the comments.
,notsy_tpb,2008-07-13T06:59Z,Actually found the sound. I had to have the dolby box checked in ffdshow tryout. Sound works. The other version appears to have commercials removed. Video quality is the same.
