"where the trees go (part 2) is dustin's most lovely musical venture yet, and it has a novelty that cannot be denied. the simple messages signifying perspicacity are insightful, the vocals are unfeigned, and the music is gentle and serene. i can honestly say, where the trees go (part 2) is beautiful in all senses of the word."
