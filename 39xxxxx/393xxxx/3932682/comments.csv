,MagiciansFR,2007-12-14T01:23Z,"Oh WOW, Super! I didn't know any of the Seven Suns series was in audio. If you have the rest PLEASE post. I don't care for the mp4 but can translate to mp3. And it is WAY past time for the next book in the series. Could have easily done without his Krypton and Slan book."
