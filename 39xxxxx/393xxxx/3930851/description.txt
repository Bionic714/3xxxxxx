THE OFFICIAL COMPANY STATEMENT! "Giving The Gift of Happiness" We at Cocaine Music For Republicans would like to take a few moments to welcome you. We trust that you'll enjoy being a part of the Cocaine family. Republicans have been making cocaine music for over thirty-five years. Cocaine is all over America. Grocery stores, manufactures, motels, military bases, restaurants and drug stores give cocaine to their users and customers as a traffic builder and a "thank you."
