Bishop T Allen Greenfield\'s personal account of how he was thrown out of the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), an organization once headed by Aleister Crowley.

His critique of the Ordo Templi Orientis at the beginning of the book is thought provoking and sheds some light on this mysterious order and some suspected shortfalls in the organization.  

The second half of the book deals with his personal expulsion from the OTO and leads the reader to wonder whether or not the OTO is participating in a silencing of its critics and behaviour most often thought to be associated with Scientologists.

Read this rare account of what goes on behind the scenes in the world of magick and the occult.
