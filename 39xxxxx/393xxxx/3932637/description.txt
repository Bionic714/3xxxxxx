This is a small E-book from David Deangelo which outlines specific "critical bridges" of the entire meeting to sex sequence. If you don't understand this area fully, this is an interesting book to read.

This E-book gives you the critical moments such as approach, kiss and sex.  Also with them it also provides useful information and suggestions for each, so this is well worth checking out as a small outline into the dating world or some extra information for anyone who wants to further their knowledge in this area.
