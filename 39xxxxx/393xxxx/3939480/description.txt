Overview:	One of the great kung-fu film characters is â??Beggar Su,â?? a legendary Ching Dynasty figure who was also a member of the famous Ten Kwangtung Tigers. Little-known director Liu Shih-yu uses the best kung-fu actors Shaw Studios had to offer to tell a rare, colorful, action-packed adventure, as Beggar Su and his brother train incessantly to defeat the brutally powerful thief called Centipede. The result is not only reminiscent of preeminent director Liu Chia-liangâ??s work, but essentially an homage to him as well!
