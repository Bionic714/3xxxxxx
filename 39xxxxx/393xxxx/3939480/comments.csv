,blackgoju,2008-01-05T17:27Z,"Everytime I try to burn this torrent, I get message that says ""wrong mux""? Is there a another way to correct this?"
,mistertpitydafoo,2008-01-08T02:22Z,"Current seeders and downloaders, please seed when you finish for others. As of today I no longer am supporting this torrent. I have to remove the file to clear space for the next movie to upload. It's been over two weeks so hopefully everyone who wants it has it. PLEASE SEED to keep it alive as long as possible!"
,mistertpitydafoo,2008-01-08T02:23Z,"i don't know. There is a program for repairing broken divx, etc files the name just escapes me right now."
,mistertpitydafoo,2008-01-08T02:24Z,I think it's called VirtualDub. That could probably repair whatever problem  you are encountering. I'm not too skilled with it so maybe do a websearch for help on using it. Sorry that you are having a problem. I just burn it to a data dvd and play it in my standalone dvd player that plays divx ultra files. So I haven't seen what happens when you try converting it to a dvd or whatever you are trying to do with it.
