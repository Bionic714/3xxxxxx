*THIS IS NOT A REMASTER BUT THE ORIGINAL VINYL AS IT WAS MEANT TO SOUND*

Three Cool Cats was one of the fifteen songs recorded by the Beatles for their Decca Records audition on New Years Day, 1962, at the Decca Studios in London. 

A cover of the 1958 song by the Coasters, and written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, the Beatles version featured George Harrisons vocals and Pete Best on drums. Their manager Brian Epstein personally chose this and the fourteen other audition numbers from the Beatles repertoire they were performing in the Merseyside dance halls and rock clubs.

Hello Little Girl is a song written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney in 1957 and was also used as one of the songs at The Beatles unsuccessful Decca audition in 1962. It is the first song ever written by John Lennon.
