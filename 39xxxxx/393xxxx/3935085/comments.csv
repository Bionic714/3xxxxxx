,dirtyodesertdog,2007-12-16T05:05Z,If this is the retail boxed version?How come it says Nero demo??
,Rasmus-K,2007-12-16T12:48Z,Is it a demo ? o.o*
,st341th,2007-12-16T14:59Z,"Oh yeah, it's 700 megs worth of demo... Fucking retard(s)

If yours says demo after installing it then you obviously didn't enter the serial provided."
,D3nn05,2007-12-16T16:40Z,this nero suck!!!!!
,nospam9,2007-12-16T16:53Z,"Download trial http://www.nero.com/enu/downloads-nero8-trial.php

Disconnect Internet and install using this key.

Before rebooting, 

1) delete or rename C:\Program Files\Common Files\Nero\Shared\NL3\NeroPatentActivation.exe

2)Use Sysinternal's autoruns.exe to disable various  Nero files from executing.  

3)Disable various Nero services.  

4) Reboot once with internet disconnected.  Run through various Nero apps and verify if it complains.  Don't worry about Nero Scout not being installed correctly.

5) If all okay, reconnect !"

,st341th,2007-12-17T17:31Z,"Is it possible you had a previous nero demo key left in your registry?

Glad you liked it anyhow. :)"
,Moviefreak69,2007-12-17T19:13Z,Works great! Does anyone have Nero Blu-ray HD DVD Video Plug-in for this??? Its a Enhancement for Nero 8 Ultra Edition. For better playback of HD movies & sound.
,Moviefreak69,2007-12-17T20:20Z,"Never mind, I found out what to do. If anyone else is interested this is what to do:
1. Download keymaker for Nero 8( This includess keymaker for blu-ray/HD DVD plug-ins) Generate key....
2.Open the Nero ControlCenter in Nero StartSmart by clicking on the 'NeroStart' button in the lower left-hand corner and then click on Toolbox >> ControlCenter. On the left-hand side, click on 'License' and 'Add', in order to enter your Nero serial number. After you have entered your serial number, click again on 'Add'. Close the ControlCenter and confirm the following messages by clicking 'OK'. Restart Nero StartSmart to activate the changes.

All done:)"

,nomeds,2007-12-18T01:29Z,"THIS IS A FUCKING DEMO & HAS 8 virus's IN IT
GET YOUR FUCKING SYSTEM SORTED YOU FUCKING twat.

YOU SAY MY Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition 10.1.7000.7 HAS 3 virus's IN IT 
YOU FUCKING CUNT YOU HAVE THE virus's"
,st341th,2007-12-18T03:39Z,"Nomeds, I refer to your latest discharge of plebeian verbiage; in which, you have proven, once again, that there is no such thing as unutterable nonsense. Rumor has it that you are almost incomprehensible in person (as revealed by your desperate urge to babble nonsensically on message boards.) No doubt, this rumor is true.

When I want your monkey-brained opinion I'll rattle your cage, okay? You are obviously suffering from Clue Deficit Disorder. Anyway, who was talking to you or even taking you under consideration? Oh well, as the late Douglas Adams said: ""You live and learn. At any rate, you live.""

If that post was intended as a joke, you forgot to include the punch line. You are nastier than a five-dollar whore getting a shit enema. You're a waste of time, space, air, flesh, and the rectum you were born from, retard. Maybe you wouldn't read like such a pathetic loser if your brain cells weren't on the Endangered Species list; if your weren't so fat that when you stand on the weighing scale, it reads: ""Sorry, we don't weigh livestock."", or if you didn't have a face that makes people ask: ""Damn, is it Halloween already?"" No, come to think of it, you would.

Now, why don?t you climb onto that Special Needs tricycle of yours with the fourth wheel attached for extra-ensured retard stability and pedal your fat ass down to the sports field and do some ?outdoors? stuff for a change. Hell, if you don?t like it, you can always offer to lick-clean the jockstraps."
,nomeds,2007-12-18T04:43Z,"Oi st341th you are a dum shit & for anouther thing on mininova i never get complaints on any files i share.
note on last check on mininova 38560 Downloads ov my AntiVirus & no complaints at all.  so wot duse that say about you!!!!"
,ElKashish,2007-12-18T15:56Z,"Excuse me for the basic question, but it seems the iso file is bigger than my CD's capacity (the funny thing is I'm using an older version of Nero to do it). What can I do?"
,st341th,2007-12-18T16:45Z,"Nomeds, not only did you call me a ""dum shit"" which is spelt wrong, just like everything else you've ever tried to type, but your comment is a tedious, homogenised, chameleon-esque scribble which amounts to nothing more than the demented cacophonous racket of a drugged lunatic banging loudly on kitchen pots and pans. Your ineffective imitation of good posting style only serves to illuminate your lack of substance, good taste, and decency.

I don't know what makes you such a worthless poster, but it really works!

Are you normally this dumb or are you just having a ""Nomeds"" moment? You couldn't get a clue during clue mating season in a field of clues if you smeared your body in musk and did the clue mating dance. Have you ever noticed that whenever you sit behind a keyboard, some idiot starts typing?

If brains were gasoline, you wouldn't have enough to drive an ant's Go-cart around the inside of a bottle cap. You must have a very large brain to hold such a vast amount of complete shit. Oh well, at least you only charge what your free advice is worth.

When god was handing out personalities, you must have been holding the door. You're so boring, even a boomerang wouldn't come back to you. Any friend of yours is a lousy judge of character. Seriously, I've come across decomposing dog carcases that are less offensive to the senses than you are. Maybe you wouldn't read like such a pathetic loser if you weren't so dumb that even blondes tell jokes about you; if your weren't so fat that buildings bounce when you haul your Sumo Wrestler mass down the street, or if you didn't have a face that could scare a hungry wolf off a meat truck. No, come to think of it, you would.

In future, if you have something to say, just fuck off."
,ElKashish,2007-12-18T17:49Z,"Stealth, after you are done flaming nomeds (why bother?) would you be able to answer my question? Or should I use nomeds' tactics? ROFL"
,st341th,2007-12-18T19:41Z,"I assume you to be using 650mb discs? You can safely delete the contents of the ""Nero PhotoShow Express\data"" folder in the iso and then burn it."
,ElKashish,2007-12-18T22:17Z,"Thanks. Stupid me LOL...I just extracted it and used the setup.exe 

Simpler than burning it :-)"
,st341th,2007-12-18T22:24Z,Your welcome :D - will start taking requests here now.
,dirkzen,2007-12-19T01:45Z,"Fuckin lawl  XD  So many angry comments.. downloaded here, gonna install in a few.  Scanned with Avast!,  Virus/spyware free.  Needed a new version of nero here, my old one is dying o.0.  I'll give a review on how the install/setup goes ^^

,st341th,2007-12-30T23:00Z,"Team Stealth would like to personally thank those of you who appreciated this torrent. It will encourage us to bring you more of the scene releases that often don't make it to public trackers such as this one.

And Nomeds, we're glad you only charge what your free advice is worth."
,LDBAMC,2008-01-01T22:55Z,"Excellent. I didn't install with your serial the first time, so it obviously didn't work, but with a little reinstall and change of serial, it works fine now. Nothing extra needed. Many thanks."
,BLuNTeD,2008-01-11T22:06Z,"lmao @ stealth!!! :D

thanks for uploading this, im just about to download it right now after i finish laughing my ass off at your reply to nomeds!!! :D :D

,SuicideCow,2008-01-17T12:54Z,"@Nomeds.
Maybe you should consider of taking a different anti virus.
Symantec/Norton is one of the worst anti virus software you can have.
Try installing NOD32 or Kaspersky.


p.s. Your mother is way too expensive...."
,DAVIDO14,2008-01-21T00:29Z,Thanks no virus sanned with norton 360
,SuckaFace,2008-01-21T15:11Z,"I've had this download working fine for the longest time and now I'm getting a ""Non-Licensed Usage"" which does make sense b/c of the patent activation and serial that goes with it: 1K22-2867-0K95-61K4-5000-CKAC-AA8X
None of the Nero apps will open, I'd rather not take the time to clear all the registry and reinstall again. st341th any hints?"
,st341th,2008-01-22T01:26Z,"Going by that i can only assume you've updated nero using the control center and thus reinstalling the patent activation. I would suggest running our crack again, we are currently working on a prebeta of nero as the latest build 8280 contains a form of spyware also known as the ceip. If you did update to the latest build then i would recommend you reinstalling this one, as the newer build validates the serial through alternate means."
,tacinbacthursday,2008-01-30T05:02Z,I did everything you said to do but when i run the NeroPatentActivation.exe it just flashes at me. Im still getting the activate patent and its not letting me use it. What now?
,StarryKnight,2008-02-19T15:45Z,Hi there... after installation i restarted my comp... and then ran the neropatentactivation.exe... but nothing happened... it just pops up again and again about the patent activation crap whenever i try to encode any files either in vision or burning rom ... what did i do wrong?? Please reply
,st341th,2008-03-12T23:09Z,"Thanks for seeding this for so long people, please now dedicate your bandwidth to this torrent instead http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4077001/ - This is again the full retail version unlike all the other "
