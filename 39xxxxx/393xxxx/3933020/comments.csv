,shmulikd,2008-03-27T06:16Z,"Plays nicely on the computer as downloaded.  However, after  converting to DVD (using ConvertXtoDVD) I can not play on a regular DVD player, it says ""playback prohibited due to area restrictions"".  Does anybody know how to remove the restriction?  Thanks."

I use Windows DVD Maker to burn AVI's to DVD. And it has a setting for either output NTSC (U.S) or PAL (Europe). This movie was ripped from a PAL DVD (25 fps) and I used the NTSC setting to burn it to DVD and it plays perfectly on my DVD Player. I've never used ConvertXtoDVD but it may have a similar setting. 

Thanks:
JayRay"

I just found the user manual on the internet, and you need to go Settings and click on TV Options and choose which format you want to Output (NTSC or PAL). Here's the address for the manual:

Hope this has been helpful because the movie comes out good on DVD.

Thanks:

,isisx3,2009-06-22T17:06Z,"great clean download, audio/video quality is amazing for being a 1961 film. THanks Jayray.

For the person that asked for the subtitle I'm not sure in what languge you want it in but heres one for english which I assume is what you want. 

I stumbled apon this one when I was trying to download subtitles in Portuguese, this one is actually in English, whoever posted it must've miss categorized it.

Good torrent!!!
Tanks!!!"
,shiningwiz,2011-01-30T14:06Z,"Excellent video and audio quality. The only slight problem is the aspect ratio is slightly off. As you can see in the description, it says the resolution is 720 x 448 which gives you an aspect ratio of 1.607 but really it's supposed to be 16:9

This can easily be corrected with VLC or Media Player Classic, of course."
,treknut72,2011-05-01T14:39Z,"or try kmp player. plays all formats and lets you resize to any aspect and lets you print screen, if you decide to.   :)"
