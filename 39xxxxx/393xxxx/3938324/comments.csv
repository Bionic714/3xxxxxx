,bl00dcl0t,2008-01-08T19:31Z,"how about a bit more of a description.
is this a lecture or an actual audio book?
how long is the run time?
how many files?
etc.

This stuff is probably worth listening to, but you haven't made it look like it's worth downloading."
[T],PracticingToublemaker,2008-01-11T10:19Z,"From www.onebigtorrent.org:
This is the new book by Noam Chomsky, What We Say Goes: Conversations on U.S. Power in a Changing World: Interviews with David Barsamian, 2007. 

This is the unabridged audio format, so the actual conversations between Chomsky and Barsamian.

Since you are getting this for free, please think about donating or buying the copy.  It is important to support independent media sources, so donate to some of the following outlets which release Chomsky books, articles or interviews:

The American Empire Project: http://www.americanempireproject.com/bookpage.asp?ISBN=0805086714
Zmagazine: http://www.zmag.org/weluser.htm
Alternative Radio with David Barsamian: http://www.alternativeradio.org/
Democracy Now: http://democracynow.org/

So think of it as a donation for the book, give whatever you think its worth... Keep supporting independent media, and help seed!

Run time is 3:41"
