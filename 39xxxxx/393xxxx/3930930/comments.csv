,tWreCK51,2007-12-15T22:02Z,"So, is this the FULL retail PAL version and not the compressed versions found on other sites? 

If so, my hat goes off to you altovoltalje - a very generous upload! Thank you very much :)"

,fa_na_tic,2007-12-19T22:23Z,"wow altovoltaje, this is one great upload! Hats off to you!
now, you may laugh at my question, but what's the way to write this on a dvd (well 2)?"
,Chris5522,2008-04-29T14:35Z,"And how do u do that? Some of us don't know everything about computers :p

I have now downloaded 17,5 GIG of this and its still not more than 83,3% finish. And here it sayes the file is 13,3 GIG. I realy want this but will it work after DL? Can I just delete this shitfiles u talk about?"
,Bicstor,2008-05-05T10:28Z,"If your torrent client supports it get the the level 1 block list from bluetack.co.uk it contains a list of known anti p2p address ranges/law enforcement ranges and many others. if your client doesnt support it then you will have to add the addresses to your firewall, i wouldnt like todo that, the file has approx 250,000 ranges that it blocks(some overlap)

As for when you have finished downloading the torrent, your client should either checksum it for you, or their will be an option to check it, and then re-download the bad chunks"
