[T],metalcore.,2007-12-14T09:13Z,is this a documentary or  a collection of films..if so which films?
[V],velvetfog,2007-12-14T21:12Z,"It contains clips from many of Berkeley's films. Sorry, but I don't have a list.

The movie is 163 min. long. It covers Berkeley's career quite comprehensively."
,contir,2007-12-16T16:43Z,This is an awesome and delightful collection. The scenes are fully restored to their original black and white pristine excellence. Makes you want to spend a few days watching all these films from beginning to end. Thanks for a great disk. I will seed as long as I can.
,crassiusmufumbu,2009-07-30T06:09Z,Dude...this is awesome thanks!!!! This guy kicks everyones ass that choreographs today. Mindblowing stuff.

[V],big_dad_e,2009-09-19T10:51Z,"""The Busby Berkeley Disc,"" ditches the stories in favor of a cavalcade of 20 musical numbers. This compilation, created for laserdisc release in 1992, is especially fascinating.) Along with ""42nd Street"" ? the only one of the six DVDs previously released (and the only one sold separately) -- we get ""Footlight Parade,"" ""Dames"" and two entries in the ""Gold Diggers"" series (1933 and 1935). Berkeley standbys Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell are joined by the likes of Ginger Rogers, Joan Blondell, James Cagney and all those WB character actors."
