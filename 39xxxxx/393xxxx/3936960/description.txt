This is a rip of Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking. I ripped this with Handbrake into an AVI. I\'ll keep seeding this day and night, so there\'s always going to be at least one seed on it.

Great movie. Personally, the quality on this isn\'t DVD quality, but it\'s fine for a viewing. I own the DVD, so I ripped it from that. If something\'s wrong, don\'t hesitate to comment here about it and I\'ll try and fix it as soon as possible.

Just figured I\'d give back to the community after taking so much.
