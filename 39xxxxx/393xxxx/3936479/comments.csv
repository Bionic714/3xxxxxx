Do not worry if I stop seeding, I can't seed all day long... but my seed will resume late (around 22:00 central European time) and last almost all night long.

Seed may also be stopped if my tunnel fails, it WILL resume later for sure !

Enjoy"

,levdr,2008-04-15T21:30Z,I've been looking for Cinematize 2 pro and saw that you uploaded it some time ago (and maybe stopped seeding because of the nasty comment someone wrote?). I was wondering if maybe you were willing to reseed it. I would be very grateful to you.
