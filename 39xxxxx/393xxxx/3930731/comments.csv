This link for the EA-6B should work, but they are in folders, which looks like you may need to download the files individually. I had uploaded it in a .zip file, but this did not work for some reason. I'll see what i can do to give a simple direct download link. Thanks again. "
,Condor707,2007-12-13T07:14Z,"There is no F-35 for FSX. However, there is a patch you can download to make it work in FSX. Its on Simviation.com"
