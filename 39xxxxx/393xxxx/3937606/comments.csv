From 20:00 to 23:00 eastern time
This will slow your downloads a bit.
Sorry for the inconveniance.
CREEDANCE"
,Creedance,2007-12-18T02:01Z,It is now 20:00 eastern time. This will be the reference point for you international downloaders
,Dream_Theater,2007-12-21T13:59Z,there is no sound on the voices. only the music. so I recommend not to download this torrent.
,Creedance,2007-12-21T23:49Z,"Get the k-lite codec pack or the Ace mega codec pack it will work fine after that
You should ask for solutions instead of recommenging things without having the proper knowledge Dream_theater"
,Creedance,2007-12-21T23:55Z,Enter codecs in tpb search bar and voila they should all appear just click and execute.

,telemauro,2008-02-13T11:50Z,very good thank you
,Disturbing,2008-03-23T13:36Z,"I downloaded this and have the k lite pack installed,  my sounds is still messed up though. Basically the background sound is amplified but the voices are really quiet...almost non existent. Any solutions Creedance?"
,ravi000,2008-04-03T13:50Z,"@Disturbing - Try the volume boost in media player classic...go to view > options > audio switcher > make sure ""regain volume"" is checked and increase the boost slider fully to the right and apply the settings and see. This provides a volume boost."
,Glitterspell,2008-04-25T23:47Z,This video is beautiful thanks Creedance I can't play your pirates trilogy yet but I can play this one without a problem excellent download...
,Creedance,2008-05-15T17:16Z,"glitterspell, make sure you have a good codec pack and run it with windows media... you can also burn it with nero and watch it on your dvd player if all else fails."
,Glitterspell,2008-05-19T08:14Z,"LOL, I have tried getting my dvd's onto my computer of pirates but they don't seem to want to load I had nero on my computer and all the only one that comes up on my computer is Harry Potter and atleast I still own it I found another pirate torrent on the site to use thanks for posting up the other one though and for trying to help out. You've got good taste in movies..."
,ytrewq121212,2008-09-11T04:45Z,"hi.

,Glitterspell,2008-11-10T02:30Z,There are no subtitles in this download you can find other torrents with subitles...
,undrscore,2010-12-14T13:40Z,"Awesome quality, but, it is edited shorter? the whole beginning of the movie was chopped off. Am I missing something here?"
,undrscore,2010-12-14T13:51Z,"EDIT: Ok, i am extremely sorry on that last comment, completely my fault for not checking properly, i thought i had opened the first movie but i had not, it's all there. THANK YOU very much Creedance."
