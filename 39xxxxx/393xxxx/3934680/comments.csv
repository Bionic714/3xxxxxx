,MasterTelia,2007-12-15T17:32Z,"thx barker

gc games worked on my wii with wiikey, even though i didnt expect metal gear solid to work as its a dual mini dvd game, but im not all the way to where you have to change discs so i cant say if that will work yet"

,mickpal,2007-12-28T15:17Z,"Is this used to make the wii able to accept games burned on a dvd r+? Sorry for my ignorance, but trying to figure out what I need to dl gamnes and burn them! thanks in advance for your help!"
,Barker91,2007-12-28T17:07Z,"no. it is made for many stuff. like burning an emulator or making your own GCOS disc. i recommend that you don't use DVD+R. it works but it wears down on the wii's laser alot. Use DVD-R instead, since it doesn't wear down on your wii and is more likely to work:)"
,Barker91,2007-12-28T17:09Z,to burn games you need IMGBURN and DVD-R and use winRAR to unpack them:)
,mickpal,2007-12-29T16:02Z,Barker--thanks for your help! Heres another dumb rookie question...just got the wii this week and right out of box can I burn games using img burner to dvd r- or do I need to add anything else as far as hardware/software to make wii recognize the disc?
,Barker91,2007-12-29T18:51Z,you have to use IMGburn on a DVD-R but you also need a wiikey installed. Wiikey is a chip that you attach inside the wii. you could tell me wich country you are from so i can give you the links where you could find this modchip :)
,mickpal,2007-12-29T19:51Z,United States- Is it hard to install? How technical?
,MasterTelia,2008-01-05T18:19Z,"depending on if its an early version its very easy install the wiikey


also barker need your help..... again, lol"
,Norwegian_Smiley,2008-01-17T22:07Z,so these CD's will only work if you have WiiKey?
,Hanzen,2008-01-19T04:09Z,does alcohol 120% work to burn dl wii games?
,Barker91,2008-04-16T18:19Z,"hansen... please! i just said it only burns on dvd-R, only use that kind of disc to be sure it will burn! use img burn!"
,dog10dog,2009-03-13T00:14Z,you can use homebrew channel it will soft mod your wii no taking it a part
