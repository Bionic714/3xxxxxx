The Droyds - All I Ever Wanted (Dusty Kid Needs Love Mix 2007) [Progressive House]


My previous post of Dusty Kid's remix of The Egg's "Nothing" is going very well indeed.

There were approximately 3,500 hit and run downloads on my release schedule in the last 24 hours.  And that statistic is from Mininova only.  There is no way for me to know what the hit count is on The Pirate Bay.


The longer it takes to well seed torrents that I post, the longer it will take me to post.

Please bear in mind, that every little helps.


This release was supposed to have been posted yesterday...
