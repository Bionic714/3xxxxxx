XxX_OS_x86_10.4.11_Install_Disc_Intel - Rev.1.0

Finally, here is the goodone. Permission bug present in the previous 10.4.11 ISO posted at M.N. (do not download that one) is fixed...
Added the requested ICH9 support, ALC889a audio, and fix minor bugs here and there...
test on SSE2: YOU STILL NEED TO USE THE 8.9.1 KERNEL (included) ON SSE2 MACHINES!!!... but maybe sse2 users can find another working combination by themselves.

Repacked for saving some MB downloads (1.5 GB compressed)



This installer is based on the XxX 10.4.10 release.

It includes all the drivers, fixes and PPFs plus the following new features:

-Apple 10.4.11 combo update; as optional choice, so you can still install 10.4.10 if you wish.
-EFI patches by Netkas & ToH. With this patches and the right hardware you will be able to run
unmodifyed Apple's stock kernels and most of the original kexts. More info at Netkas.org. Also allow you
to use GUID partitions (original intel mac's partition scheme).
-A few more drivers; G80 (nv8x00), NVInject, NVInjectGo, ALC880/850, Yukon 88E8053, etc.
