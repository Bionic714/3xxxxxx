,Angerfist_DJ,2007-12-24T21:06Z,"How the f*ck do you install this crap? XD
The readme says: if you get an error, ignore it.
How the hell can i ignore it, when it shuts down the keygen? XD Anyone can explain me please?
Thanks a lot, and i'n still seeding (a)"
,Capt.Jambo,2007-12-25T04:12Z,"Hi all, I just wished this aircraft had FMC, this aircraft is very nice to look at, but that ain't what I'm looking for when simulating a flight, the thing that most interests me is the FMC, I think that block will be available some time in the future, at least I hope so! But then again, THANX VERY MUCH FOR SHARING IT WITH US samayot! 

Merry christmas and a very good 2008"
,Angerfist_DJ,2007-12-25T10:35Z,"Yo Jambo,

I have that FMC right now in the 757, so i think you do something WRONG?"
,Angerfist_DJ,2007-12-25T10:49Z,"Oh yeah, i forgot to ask if it was nice that i upload with 190 KB/s ? :D"
,Angerfist_DJ,2007-12-26T11:36Z,"@samayot

How does it come that the numbers of the heading, altitude, vertical speed, and speed doesn't work after install?

Does it had something to do with the soundpack?"
,Angerfist_DJ,2007-12-26T12:56Z,"I'm the SPAMKING

Okay, ik have a solution...

Intall everything, and at the end, install the 1.4 757-200 base package, and select ''repair''.

Now the AP numbers work again.."
,Capt.Jambo,2007-12-26T14:17Z,"Hi Angerfist_DJ, 

How come?! I think i did every thing exactky as instructed...It is a executable file, how can one mess it up? buy the way, I only installed basepack since I just wanted to test it!

Cheers"
,Capt.Jambo,2007-12-26T14:19Z,"HI,

I installed block C aswell 

Cheers"
,Angerfist_DJ,2007-12-27T11:54Z,"Yo need to install everything i think...lol
And explain me, how to buy the way?

Thnx XD"
,Capt.Jambo,2007-12-27T18:02Z,"Hello, 
That really does not make sense! one does not have to install  300 and freighter in order for it to work! but then again I will try it anyway! You say the FMC works properly? If no FMC this plane is worst then CLS software which is rubbish to me!"
,Capt.Jambo,2008-01-03T23:01Z,"Hi all, can anyone help me out? I do not have the FMC working, does anyone beside Angerfist_DJ know how to fix this or this plane has no FMC? I would really appreciated.

Thanx"
,kovacsbela,2008-01-08T20:16Z,"Yeah...it's a great plane, but I don't have that FMC either, though I installed all currently available blocks...what's the story here? I've read that block F will contain it, but I've seen some shots with FMC...would be nice to know the SECRET :)"
,Nassikastike,2008-01-11T18:09Z,"Does this package include 
757-200
757-200 Cargo
757-300
models?"
,Nassikastike,2008-01-21T16:30Z,it would be nice if someone with 100% copy shared this. Everybody has 97.5%
,Diseal3,2008-02-03T19:24Z,25 kb/s =( .... When and If i get 100% I'll scan and if it's good I'll seed.
,cr02,2008-02-17T15:29Z,"Im also having the FMC problem when the FMC is blank and i can i adjust the brightness but the screen wont display anything, and could somebody please explain why this torrent has 150 parts that are all exactly the same???
Thanks"

,Capt.Jambo,2008-06-09T00:43Z,"Hello 

Here is my first request ever!

Block F version 2.0

One can download it from theire web site but can not install

Maybe a loader would do just fine!

Thanx"
,CD-r80g,2008-08-28T12:33Z,"ATTENTION!!!! THE KEYGEN DOES WORK!!!
All you have to do to install the plane and open the Keygen is start your computer in Safe mode. To do this, simply turn off your computer, wait 30 secs, turn it back on and tap the F8 key until a menu come ups. Select ""Safe mode"", and open the keygen from there! It works! Thanks a lot Samayot, u the man :)"
,eneee,2008-09-03T09:51Z,Keygen has virus :((((
,Publius,2008-09-09T01:35Z,"**NO THERE IS NOT A VIRUS IN THE KEYGEN.**

Your scanner might be returning a false positive.

Confirmed: Running ""CS 757 Block B v1.4.exe"" and selecting ""Repair""  after completing the install via the instructions, restores the missing AutoPilot readout."

,bigscott55,2011-06-21T00:56Z,"i cant get the insatller and keygen to work.  i put all 4 files in one folder (blocks b,c,e and keygen).. open keygen, choose base, and generate.  i get an error and the keygen closes.  so then i open block B, and i go through installer steps, but it asks me to activate.  i try both onlnine and manual activation and it either asks for my order number (tried random number, nothing) or asks for a .txt file sent from CS... i cant get past any of this, it seems like thekeygen did not do its job."
