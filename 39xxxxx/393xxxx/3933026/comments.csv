Not only was it a poor vocalist doing an insulting impression of Elliott Smith over sloppy, childish overdubbing, but the song choice was a joke and so was the guitar playing. I assume this was put online as some sort of a joke, and perhaps I am just bitter because I fell for it, but I hereby warn anyone else who might consider this a tribute to stay far away. I am officially now a non-fan of this ""artist"" and am glad to see that there are no seeders for this horrible file."
