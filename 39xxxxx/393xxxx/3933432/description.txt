:. about .:

Your name is Wolfhound. You are the last of your clan. 

You were taken screaming from your mother?s breast and enslaved,
whilst your parents were murdered at the hands of a murderous butcher. 

You now have your freedom and there is only one thought on your mind,
...revenge! 

All you remember about the person who ripped your family apart is the weapon
he used and the mark on his hand. 

Your quest is to find him and make him pay for the death of your family with his 
death - by your sword.

Before you can repay the evil that was done to you and your parents, you must wear
a mask of friendship to all those that you meet on your travels. 

The only way to get the information you need is by offering help to others. 

You will have to perform a variety of tasks, spend time building up your skills, weapons 
and armour, as well as training yourself by fighting lesser enemies.

Danger lurks all around these lands not only from the living but also from the undead!
Always keep your best weapon close to hand!

S p e c i a l   I n f o   N o t e :

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of a packed .exe 

( GameStart.exe )

as a lame virus, (coz its thebyte by byte check error of em!.) 

Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics

you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!.
