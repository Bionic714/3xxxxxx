,MSC111,2007-12-15T12:59Z,"It does not work:
it says invalid code with every game"
,TheBlackPearl,2007-12-15T16:35Z,"Msc111, you have to click already paid, then find the product id, enter it in the keygen, then enter gen."
,TheBlackPearl,2007-12-15T16:39Z,"Hey guys, or you can try this: click already paid, then click I AM NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET, then get the code from there."

,ebmale,2007-12-27T21:52Z,just tried this and IT DOES NOT work with the new games. and yes I do know what I am doing.
,littlenell,2008-01-08T11:15Z,everything that we finds work for about 1 to 2 games then dont work no more i just tryed a patcher and again that didnt work either
,Hostel-1,2008-03-06T06:41Z,Reflexive changed their code... this will work on the old games. You are better off downloading the full versions off of here or another torrent site. All patchers and keygens here are shit!
