documentary called "uncovered: the war in iraq".  not the best in my book, (why we fight is the best), but if you're already interested then here ya go.  rednecks unite and yell away in the angry comment section.  i am a bleeding heart that bleeds information for people who are interested.  information is power only if you are intelligent.
