,bacon_kalonji,2007-12-12T15:10Z,"The funny thing is that all of this WILL be uncovered and these retard rednecks (hielo, bobdaslob) will walk around in shame as many germans did after WWII. You are puppets!!!!

The truth shall strike you all down!!!"
,Bamimi,2007-12-12T16:28Z,"wars have been fought since the dawn of man, for whatever reasons. we did not and do not war in iraq because we hate anyone. we're doing it to stop the shit. when the shit stops, then we will stop. its that simple. It was the US who saved iraq from being wiped off the face of the earth by iran in the first place, in case no one remembers. we are not enemies of iraq, but are friends that will ensure it's peace, and put our lives on the line because of it. granted we dont die as much as others do, but hey, we're not about to apologize for that. we're tough sob's, and we have the technology and ability to majorly fuck our enemies up. People who think we are pruposely trying to hurt innocent people are nuts. we all know we have the ability to REALLY do major damage if that was our goal. the fact that we are not should show it isnt our goal. our goal is peace for us, peace for the people and a happy and useful friendship to us all. with all the money we've dumped into the country, there is no way we're doing it for profit either."

,Nikos6266,2007-12-13T09:58Z,"Iliteracy is what creates people like hielo999 and bobdaslob. If these two people had finished primary school they wouldn't post those things.
@ Bamini:
Your comments are really interesting and have a lot of truth in them. However indeed the USA were allies with the criminal Sadam while he commited his hideous crimes against his own people and the people of Iran. You didn't stop him back then. Now with your invasion you killed a handful of criminals (Sadam and his close supporters) and 1 million innocent Iraqis. It seems wrong to me. America had all the means to arrange the assasination of Sadam and his cabinet and save many innocent lives."
,Up_Load,2007-12-13T20:22Z,"Well Nikos6266, then they would not have had the opportunity to control and steal from the Iraqi oil fields. You need military muscle to organise theft on this scale. So you come up with some bullshit to invade and some more bullshit to extend your stay there till the job is done. "

   The Iran-Iraq war goes back to Reagan/Cheney supporting Iraq with weapons & intelligence for our own Imperialistic reasons, not because we care about them.  I think 600,000+ dead Iraqis is a possible definition for 'major damage'.  There have been contractors sent there for America's financial gain, not Iraq's; recent approval of permanent bases there for decades, and contractors to get preferences over Iraqi contractors.  

   The Pentagon told America they would go there, take him out, and then leave.  That was never the plan obviously, as it could have happened that way.  

   Not all Americans support this bullshit; no country is all evil; though it's taken this long for many to realize.  The media isn't showing all the demonstrations and anger and resentment for obvious reasons.  "
,Up_Load,2007-12-14T13:20Z,"Of course you are right spacey1. It's a shame there are so little objective americans such as yourself. Some of the comments I have read from posters like billiewinkle,  hielo999 and bobdaslob are just braindead. "
,spacey1,2007-12-21T13:38Z,"   There are many of us ~ most internet commenters are retarded super-right-wing southern assholes who do nothing else but to try to piss people off for no reason but for their own satisfactions.  

  Don't confuse them with the percentage of the whole country..."
,giffo5,2008-04-16T16:02Z,"Hey , the way i see it , wars are often about Religion.
