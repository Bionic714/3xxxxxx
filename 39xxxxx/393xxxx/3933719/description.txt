IMDB Review: This show revolves around four friends in a town that strange things happen. Think of it as almost a blend of X-Files and Saved By The Bell. The show is made by Soup 2 Nuts, the creators of Home Movies. They both have a lot in common, like their outlandish plots and obscure humour(much of the script is improvised giving the show a real candid feel and gives the comedy a layer of depth and subtlety which makes it very re-watchable).
