This is RARed ISOs for the Japanese PC Final Fantasy XI 2006 Collection DVD (core FFXI, Rise of the Zilart, Chains of Promathia, and Treasures of Aht Urhgan expansions) and the Crusaders of Altana/Wings of the Goddess expansion DVD. It's mainly to fill a request by people that want to be able to type in Japanese without third-party programs, ot have a Japanese account and need this client to be able to chaing their account information, as accounts can be logged in and played on any version of the game, but can only be edited on a version from the same region as the account.

You need an existing account or a set of unused Japanese registration codes to use this. There's no way to play this game without an account, and as such, there's no copy protection on the discs.

I've only got about 10-15 KB/s max for my upload speed, but I'll try to seed this as long as it takes to get multiple copies available for seeding.
