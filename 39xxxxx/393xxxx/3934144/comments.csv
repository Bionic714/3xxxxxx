,toshiro93710,2008-05-15T22:04Z,"Does this work with Windows Vista?  All the install shield wizards are only in question marks, even though my computer supports Japanese text, and I keep getting an error message with something about MSDN & msi (I don't know what exactly because all the text is ???).  Can anybody please help me?"
,toshiro93710,2008-05-15T22:06Z,"By the way, this happened when I tried to install the setup out of INST1 folder.  I have installed POL viewer without a problem."
,4RM0,2008-06-03T02:35Z,"This torrent is only half-useful:

I can't install FFXI (and obviously none of the expansions), but I can install PlayOnline Viewer and Tetra Master.

So really, it's basically a waste of a download, unless you can figure out how to fix it yourself. I tried and couldn't >_"
,xflames,2008-08-04T01:22Z,"ok i found a way to install the game. if u got the error: 1603, this is due of the program's language. go in region section from control panel. change it for Japanese and you're done. "

,allykir,2009-08-03T08:19Z,"although it seems to work correctly, when logging in it gives an ""An error has occurred"" of course in japanese.  I go and try it on my english version and my account worked just fine.  Next day my email and password are changed.  Suspected that this steals accounts.  I do not suggest to download."
,Paragon_FX,2010-02-19T03:44Z,Is there anyone succeeded downloading this game?
