*THIS IS NOT A REMASTER BUT THE ORIGINAL CAPITOL VINYL AS IT WAS MEANT TO SOUND*

We Can Work It Out is a song written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney and released by The Beatles as a double A-sided single with Day Tripper, the first time both sides of a single were so designated in an initial release. 

Both songs were recorded during the Rubber Soul sessions. The song is an example of Lennon-McCartney collaboration at a depth that happened only rarely after they wrote the hit singles of 1963. This song, and A Day in the Life, are among the notable exceptions.
