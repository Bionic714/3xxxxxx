Ozzie and Harriet 512 Busy Christmas

Ozzie is talked into acting as Santa for the Men's Club and also as Scrooge in a short play. He also is asked to sing Christmas Carols with all three things being on the same night. He tries hard to get a Christmas tree and put up decorations on the house but finds it impossible with the other commitments.
