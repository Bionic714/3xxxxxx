Years of Blood 

Examines the bloody terrain of the Middle East over the past six 
years. Politicians and decision makers offer their views on the 
issues, and a new understanding of the labyrinth of conflict in the 
region is brought to light.

Part 1 of 2 - No Partner

In May 2000 Israel withdrew from Lebanon. In October 2000 the second
intifada broke out, following the complete failure of peace talks
between the Israelis and the Palestinians. This film follows and
analyses the events from that time up until today. Speaking with
politicians, decision makers and leading players in the making of
this phase of history, this film goes behind doors into the arena of
the making of policies. It follows the radicalisation in the West
Bank and Gaza, and the death of the Israeli Peace Camp; the
Disengagement of the Gaza strip and the rise of Hamas to government.
It chronicles the process, and explains it. This episode starts with
the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 and takes us through
several phases up to the besieging of the Palestinian National
Authority compound in Ramallah in 2002.
