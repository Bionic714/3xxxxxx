There appears to be no-one seeding this at the mo.  Anyone else having this problem?"
,nOmArch,2008-01-21T01:17Z,"I would ask people to take note of the title of this edit, the word workprint is quite important.  the deleted scenes came in two flavours the workprint version where the picture quality was pretty good but there were SFX and other things missing and were also imcomplete.  the other version was from betamax transfer and while the quality was horrible they had all the SFX and more importantly were complete.

so what i did was completely rebuild all the used deleted scenes using the workprint versions as the base and adding in sound fx and video where needed to achieve the highest audio/video quality.

it took quite a lot of extra work but i think it was worth it in the end but due to to the varying quality of some scenes (only about 5 or 6 minutes in total) i decided to call this a 'Workprint' edition.

hope you enjoy the movie!

I might even try fix them myself eventually MPEGeditor but last time I tried to do that it was really confusing and I gave up.
:)
But good work overall and thanks for sharing."
