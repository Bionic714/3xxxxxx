   Go to My Computer. Explore the image. Inside you will find a folder called ""keygen - ZKZ"". Open it. The keygen is inside. Write again on the forums if you still can't find it.

I just scanned the image and the keygen both deos exist and it is in the place described in the nfo (really blatantly). This release is perfect.

[T],ZKZ,2007-12-18T21:16Z,"Hello,

I think you were downloading multiple torrents simultaneously and downloaded jcokerjim's UIF release, confusing it with this one. Just a guess. This release is in standard ISO format, as confirmed by over fifty responces. As for making a torrent with just the keygen, I am busy and therefore can't but I will pass on the request to the gamergirl2. If she deos she will mention it here within a few days.

I had a couple errors initially, but after checking the roxio support forums, my problem was solved and everything works perfectly. So, if anyone experiences problems, it has nothing to do with the packaging of this torrent."

[T],ZKZ,2008-02-03T17:10Z,"Hello,

The keygen is made by CORE and registers as a TROJAN on some archaic and/or cheep anti-virus programs (it doesn?t register on Kaspersky as an example). The reason for this is that as part of their reverse engineering CORE intentionally makes many of their cracks and keygens register as Trogans in order to scare away noobs and individuals who aren't affiliated with the scene. The Federation is actively trying to make the scene more public and transparent; open to all who wish to learn, but groups like HATRED and CORE believe that a public scene diminishes their work and puts them at risk of a police crack-down (the federation has heavy security protocols to prevent such an occurrence).

So the long and short of this is that while the keygen does not actually contain a Trojan, CORE has attempted to make it look that way (it also won't start if you have certain programs running). If you are still concerned use one of these serials (BR-JVCHV-MR0N0-WC5B6, 5X-L9QTT-BC6YW-70FBH & UW-F71VC-GJTYU-MCZZ9) listed ahbove by Soco86.

I hope this helps clear up any misunderstandings.

[T],ZKZ,2008-02-27T01:04Z,"Hello All,

Remember me. I was the one who brought you the Federation Co-op series. Unfortunately The Federation has had several security breaches in the last few months. Part of the flaw in freeing knowledge is that it requires a certain level of trust on the part of the teacher and the recipient. That trust was broken and the GamerGirl 2 has gone temporarily offline and underground (she is not at fault --- but that is another story). That said we are alive, and public no less. In a few days I will release ""Half-Life 2 Co-op (updated)"". It will possess an independent emulator rather than PAC-STEAM (which I happen to loathe) and as such will not need frequent updates. It will also be cleaner with a faster frame rate and most importantly a complete Half-Life 2 campaign and a (partially complete) Half-Life 2 Episode One campaign. That said in light of our recent security problems I am no longer in contact with many of our Federation Admin or my own team, and have gone LFG (actively searching for a new group). In the interim my releases will still be attributed to the Federation but will be less frequent.

One last note. I am uncertain as to what people wish to see cracked and released and am open to suggestions. Please contact me with suggestions at zkz@hush.com (for security reasons this has also changed).

I am back having formed a new team (still looking for help - auto409526@hushmail.com). I am not going to tell you what's in store just yet but we are going to kick off this party with a bang.

For Starters, Seed, Leach, and LAN our newest release.

Vampire the Masquerade - Ultimate Bloodlines is located here:
[http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4215139/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Ultimate_Bloodlines]

This is a new Release of Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines. While the original release and many other releases did contain all the necessary files for a clean install of Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, they were flawed by Vista installation problems, stability issues, crack problems, and poor documentation. By converting the content to a DVD format with a single (updated) installer, providing working cracks, better documentation, and including the Official and Unofficial Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines patches, these issues have been resolved. Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, is one of the best RPG's to come into existence and is a tribute to the unpaid work of its former developers at Troika.

I have released the Federation's final Doom 3: Ultimate Co-op build here:

[http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4218464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_(Final)]

Through better cracking techniques this torrent now is not only portable (no install required) but also possesses more content (Ecoop) while remaining a gigabyte smaller. This was a huge undertaking but I feel very positive about the end result and I intend to use it frequently myself. The next projects on tap are Half-Life Blue Shift - Co-op (tomorrow or the day after) and an updated copy of Half-Life 2 - Ultimate Co-op. I am not going to give a deadline for the Half-Life 2 as the problem is still suffering the same crucial problem which put it two months behind schedule the first time (it is painfully unstable).

Let's keep this party banging.

This is the final release for the Half-Life series and possess the following advantages over its predecessors:

(0.) This release provides co-op game play for two of the three games and includes the single player function for all three.
(1.) It has been updated and all three games now make use of the high-definition graphic updates released via steam. It also contains hundreds of new logos  and player models, allowing players to play any of the games as their favourite pop culture icons (i.e. Homer Simpson).
(2.) It is now portable, thereby simplifying installation considerably.
(3.) Many unnecessary files from the earlier releases have been removed,  
thereby greatly shrinking the size of this release (From two gig[s] to eight-hundred meg[s].
(4.) It has been updated with hundreds of bug fixes.

I as always encourage you all to seed, and enjoy this release.

[T],ZKZ,2008-06-25T10:08Z,"Hey,

I have uploaded our new Diablo Ultimate release here:

[http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4259215]

This release is a pre-cracked portable copy of Diablo I and its expansion, HellFire. HellFire has been cracked to include a multiplayer client and additional characters (Monk, Barbarian, and Bard). This release contains all the audio and video files from the old releases (thereby explaining the size) and only files which contributed nothing to gameplay have been removed. This game is not multi-language and is only available in English.

This project began when one of our members was unable to locate a Portable copy of Diablo or Hellfire (in English with the HellFire multiplayer crack). This was shocking as the Federation concentrates primarily on Co-op games and Diablo was a founding title that all our members played at one point or another. Therefore we undertook the task of creating this release. It is retro, but it is also shockingly streamlined and well developed. In short this release fulfills our requirements as it creates accessibility. 

More on the way [HL2]

I have re-released Diablo Ultimate (Discription Above) here:

[http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4260899]

The previous release for this game was nuked. This is unfortunate but as the Federation currently lacks administration (Fallout of the New vs Old), there is no one to test the releases I am uploading. The nuked release was not properly cracked but was incapable of harming the users PC. In the new release battle.net has ceased to work (although their are many alternatives for Internet and LAN based gaming).

[T],ZKZ,2008-06-27T03:03Z,"Hello All,

I have released Half-Life 2 Ultimate: Co-op here:

[http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4262500]

I know alot of you have been waiting months for this release, but it was only yesterday that a Federation member discovered the server bug fix. This release was actually completed four months ago (with the exception of the server bug fix). For those who waited patiently (and didn't spam us with the same request) the Federation is sorry for the inconvenience.

Currently this release allows for allows up to four player to go through the entire main PC campaign on various difficulty settings through an internet or LAN configuration, without needing to purchase Half-Life 2 or Half-Life:  Deathmatch. Furthermore, this game allows for the simultaneous use of the Half-Life 2, Half-Life: Deathmatch and Half-Life 2 - Co-op games. This release, like all steam cracks, only allows the user to play on cracked servers (Note: Any server hosted with this release will be automatically cracked). 

This release possesses the following advantages over its predecessors:

(1.) It has been updated and now makes use of the newest high-definition graphic updates released by Valve through Steam. It also contains new (in addition to the content in the Synergy release) icons, player models and maps.
(2.) It is now portable, thereby simplifying installation considerably.
(3.) Many unnecessary files from the earlier releases have been removed, thereby greatly shrinking the size of this release.
(4.) As this game is standalone it never requires any updates (Note: Updating the Synergy on your own may break the release as it may require newer content). Moreover all content is now included in the release thereby eliminating the need for PacSteam or any other variation of cracked steam client.
(5.) Thanks to content lifted from the C@T Half-Life 2 Collection distribution, this release now supports over twenty languages.

[T],ZKZ,2008-06-27T18:35Z,"Hello All,

I am encouraging individuals to ignore the quality rating as it is broken on The Pirate Bay, currently allowing individuals to vote an unlimited number of times. A great example of this flaw is that the Federation?s new release, ?Half-Life 2 Ultimate: Co-op [Includes Deathmatch]? , starting with a rating of negative two in spite of the fact that no individual has yet downloaded or tested it (outside of the Federation). Federation releases are having their scores sabotaged by a lone individual voting negatively multiple times, with no reflection on the release proper.

I hope this helps put some fears to rest. Federation releases have never carried a virus, and our always of the highest quality.

I have two great pieces of news.

First, and foremost, GG (GamerGirl2) has rejoined my release group (although not the Federation at large). I can't say how happy I am to see another of our prominent members return to the fold (one short of a full team). GG, you were an inspiration to us all and on behalf of my group, within the Federation I would like to express my deep respect. It takes allot of guts to come back after the fallout, and we are grateful. We missed you girl; keep those discs spinning.

Secondly, I have released the Federation's new Far Cry - Co-op release here:

[http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4268119]

This release is intended to replace the Federation's earlier Far Cry release and possesses the following advantages over its predecessor:

(1.) It has been updated and now makes use of the newest high-definition lighting and graphics. It also contains new (in addition to the content contained in the two aforementioned mod) icons, and player models.
(2.) It is now portable, thereby simplifying installation considerably.
(3.) Many unnecessary files from the earlier releases have been removed, thereby greatly shrinking the size of this release (over a Gigabyte).
(4.) It has been updated with hundreds of bug fixes, most noticeably the removal of the bandwidth limit (eliminating lag).

We have one more repackage (Quake 2 - Co-op or Die) at which point we will have re-released all of the Federation's Co-op collection. When that time arrives we will delete all the old torrents (to prevent confusion), so if you want a copy of our old stuff I'd move fast.

I am writing to ask supporters of the Federation to stop spaming positive quality votes. I know alot of people are upset at people sabotaging our release's quality comments but voting on mass the other way only legitamizes their infanitle actions. Remember that a core tennant of our philosophy is freedom of information, no matter how wrong or poisonous. Our releases are the core of the Federation, and they will stand on their own. We are the dominate release group in our field; we need no rating or title.

I have released Mass Effect - Portable here:

This release, a product of myself and GG, allows for the portable gameplay of the Mass Effect campaign, without suffering from the now infamous ""Star Map"" and ""Saving Glitches"" associated with early releases of this game. This release contains custom made icons. This release has had unnecessary content removed leaving it five-hundred megabytes smaller. Moreover this release has been customized to include several bug fixes, vastly improving overall game stability compared to other releases.

The Second Wave of releases is complete as of today. The Federation went back and looked over each of our co-op releases and sought to make them faster, more stable, smaller, and portable. This is no small feat and it is with a great sence of accomplishment that we can look back today, knowing that we suceeded by leaps and bounds. 

Today the Federation is releasing the following:

(1.) Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines - Ultimate [Portable]
[http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4363711/]

This release is intended to provide accessibility to those individuals who found difficulty in utilizing the Federation's original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines release. It has the advantages of being portable, smaller, updated (to the newest Unofficial patch) and shows increased stability. Because of these advantages this release is intended to replace all previous Federation Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines releases.

(2.) Diablo II Ultimate [Includes Lord of Destruction Expansion] 
[http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4363727]

This release is a pre-cracked portable copy of Diablo II and its expansion, Lord of Destruction. This release has been cracked to include a windowed mode. This release contains all the audio and video files from the old releases (thereby explaining the size) and only files which contributed nothing to gameplay have been removed. This game is not multi-language and is only available in English.

(3.) Quake II Ultimate Co-op [Portable] 
[http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4363733/]

This release allows up to four players to go through the main PC campaign (as well as several other maps) on the Quake II World Server. It has been modded to allow for various difficulty settings as well as new player skins and online scoring. This release also includes the Quake II graphics engines EGL (v0.3.1), and Quake2Max (v0.44) as well as new textures. Both engines come pre-installed, allowing the player to select the engine of his/her choice or use the basic Quake II engine (Updated to 3.2) created in 1996. The release is a sequal to the first Federal distribution of a Quake 2 - Co-op mod  which was replaced when the World Server was altered leaving the release unusable.

None of the above releases are ""Final"" and thus may be updated. It is also notable that several of our cell phone mods received updates today.

As the second wave of co-op releases has been completed, all old torrents have been deleted. The Federation apologizes for the inconvenience.

The Federation takes pride in all of our public releases. We envision many more positive years of cooperative educational pursuits.

To all the Fans, Friends, Foes, Members and Affiliates, of the FEDERATION:

Thanks for everything. Because of you we are ""STILL UNDERGROUND"" and ""STILL ALIVE"".

The Third Wave of releases is begining as of today. The Federation has sellected a massive array of software projects for this wave, in conjunction with a plan for the completion of the T-Box Beta. While all of these projects very both in their complexity and size they should allow for continued co-op gameplay, increaced accessibility, and unique educational challenges. 

Today the Federation is releasing the following:

(1.) Civilization II: Multiplayer Gold Edition [Portable]
[http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4396849]

This is a new Release of Civilization II: Multiplayer Gold Edition. While the original release and many other releases did contain all the necessary files for a clean install of Civilization II: Multiplayer Gold Edition, they were flawed by a critical Vista installation and playability problems, stability issues, audio-video problems, and poor documentation. By converting the content to a portable format, providing working cracks and better documentation, and including the Official and Unofficial patches, these issues have been resolved.

(2.) Audiosurf Ultimate [Portable]
[http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4396851]

This release is a pre-cracked portable copy of Audiosurf, updated to the sixth version, and packaged with the Federation's resource-hacked version of the Texture Mod Manager program. Ten textures (including the original) have been furthermore packaged with this release in an effort to expand acessability. This release has been classified as ""UPD*"" and thus will receive additional updates as they become available.

I encourage you to download, seed, and enjoy the Federation?s ongoing efforts.

I am releasing five new items from the third wave today. I do however feel I should mention that in addition to the releases below, the Federation has created two new releases which don't yet have documentation. Given that the only thing holding back there distribution is a lack of documentation, you can expect to see me host them in the next week.


Today the Federation is releasing the following:

(1.) Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines [Steam] [Portable]
[http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4494607]

This is an updated version of our Steam-Cracked version of Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines. This release, like its predecessor, was created to deal with the many critical Vista installation and playability problems, stability issues, and audio-video problems which plagued non-Federation releases. By converting the content to a portable steam format with a single installer, providing working cracks and better documentation, and including the Official and Unofficial Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines patches, these issues have been resolved.

This Federation release is different than its predecessor as it has been updated to the latest unofficial patch (5.7) and has had its vital processes isolated to increase stability.

(2.) Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines [Portable]
[http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4494603]

This is an updated version of our Non-Steam version of Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines. This release, like its predecessor, was created to deal with the many critical Vista installation and playability problems, stability issues, and audio-video problems which plagued non-Federation releases. By converting the content to a portable format with a single installer, providing working cracks and better documentation, and including the Official and Unofficial Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines patches, these issues have been resolved.

This Federation release is radically different than its predecessor, which previously could not be made portable (DVD-Hack) because it requires a multiple-level series of cracks. Thanks to development made by the iND team, we were able to convert this release to a smaller, simpler, cleaner portable format. The Federation recognizes that during various periods our DVD-Hack Vampire the Masquerade release was out most popular distribution and would like to thank all the fans who cherished our work. This release has been updated to the latest unofficial patch (5.7) and has had its vital processes isolated to increase stability.

(3.) Morrowind Co-op [Portable]
[http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4494615]

This is a new Release of Morrowind and its initial expansion, Bloodmoon. Tribunal has not been included as the Federation feels it damages game play. Originally this release was created to deal with issues found in the original non-Federation releases and many subsequent releases, including two critical Vista stability issues, and frequent playability problems. By utilizing a new wrapper of Microsoft DirectX through the MGEgui mod and complete rebuilds of the games textures through a multitude of graphic enhancement mods the Federation has been able to release a version of Morrowind which is portable, completely stable, and possesses graphics which in many instances are better than those of Elders Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

The Federation also included in this release a multiplayer function. This two player co-op function is provided through a bundled version of Morrowind Online which has been modified by the Federation for stability. Unfortunately the original issues which led to this mod being abandoned remain, primarily the inability to save new character data. This mod will however allow any two single player characters to meet and traverse the world together. The Federation considers these issues to be inconsequential as the main purpose of this release is to provide accessibility by resolving vista-related installation and gameplay issues.

I implore you to read the documentation as this release may require limited user configuration if problems present themselves.

[T],ZKZ,2009-02-14T08:16Z,"Hey All,

Today I have released three Federation torrents and as always I am here to give you the rundown on their contents.

(1.) Half-Life 2: Co-op [Campaign and Deathmatch] [Portable] [Final]

This release is identical to the old Federation Standalone build of Half-Life 2: Co-op, with the addition of unique binaries and hard linking, enabling the Campaign in single player while radically increasing the stability of the release (amazingly the size is identical). If you had trouble with the Federation?s old build, I wholeheartedly recommend this one.

URL:  [http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4722595/]

(2.) Half-Life: Co-op [Blueshift & Opposing Force & Decay] [Final]

This release is a complete rebuild from scratch allowing co-op gameplay of the main campaign (Sven has been updated to version four and ported to WON), the Opposing Force campaign, and the Decay Campaign. Blueshift is included but as it was never made to have any online capability it is not co-op. This release also contains new unique binaries and registry hacks, greatly increasing stability. 

URL: [http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4722595/]

(3.) ExeScript [Portable]

This release is a Federation build of a scripting conversion tool, commonly used in the creation of portable binaries and to test game functions. In short, ExeScript is a program that converts batch files (.bat), Visual Basic and Java scripts to executable files (.exe). It also protects thecontents of .bat, .vbs and .js files from being altered by other users accidentally or intentionally. In addition, ExeScript hides the contents of these files so they cannot be viewed. This means that all actions executed by batch files, Visual Basic or Java scripts will remain unknown and cannot be used to crack or reverse-engineer the file.

I have release the Federation's three builds of Civilization Two. All of these builds are portable, clean, efficient, vista-compliant, and heavily modified.

(1.) Civilization II: Mutiplayer Gold Edition [Portable] [Full] :

This build contains all the information from the original factory distribution and has only been modified in instances where it was required for the accessibility of the release. All video and audio files have been retained and the game functions identically to the original.
[http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4777739/]


(2.) Civilization II: Mutiplayer Gold Edition [Portable] [Thin] :

This build contains only audio and video information from the original factory distribution necessarily to the game play (such as the council of advisors). Heavy modification was required in order to make this release viable and yet with the exception of the absence of unnecessary audio and video and audio files this release functions identically to the original.
[http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4777751/]


(3.) Civilization II: Mutiplayer Gold Edition [Portable] [Ultra-Thin] :

This build contains no audio and video information from the original factory distribution. That said as Civilization effectively functions as a table-top strategy system this does not greatly diminish gameplay. Extremely heavy modification was required in order to make this release viable and yet with the exception of the absence of all video and audio files this release functions identically to the original.

In addition, there are two new releases which have been completed and will be uploaded as soon as documentation can be made. These release are the Federation's ""Black"" iPod builds and a portable release of the first decade of Command and Conquer games.

Wow, the worst burning program ever sinks to a new low.  Forget about burning any PSX or Dreamcast CDs, copying the CD Extra portions of your audio CDs, burning VCDs and SVCDs, etc.

What was that about Garbage in, garbage out again?  I couldn't agree more.  So why re-release this turd?  The Federation releases great games, but they seem to have had a brain fart in the apps department.  This was easily the worst burning program ever made even when Adaptec owned it.  Obviously it's only gone downhill since becoming Roxio.  Somehow, in spite of doing less, it's managed to bloat up to 1.54 GB of space.
