                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy Media Creator is optical disc authoring software, produced by Roxio. It is 
bundled with some optical disc recorders.

It was developed from, and obsoletes, Adaptec Easy CD Creator, which Roxio now 
owns and supports. Unlike Easy CD Creator, support for Mode 2 data recording 
has been dropped.

It has the following Minimum System Requirements:

* Windows Vista with 1.6 GHz Intel processor, 512 MB RAM
* Windows XP with 500 MHz processor or faster; 128 MB RAM
* 1 GB of free hard disk space for typical installation of all components
* 1024x768, 16-bit color graphics card
* DirectX 9 or higher compatible sound card and graphics card
* Windows Media Player 10 or higher
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 or higher
* DVD-ROM drive is required to install the software 

This is a re-release of the Roxio. While the original release did contain all
the necessary files for a clean install of Roxio Easy Media Creator 10 Suite
it was encoded in a UIF file. UIF files are only accessible if the user already
has Magic ISO (an uncommon proprietary software) installed. Then standard for 
the industry and the scene is the ISO image format. Releasing in anything else 
lessens accessibility. Given that Magic ISO provides the tools to convert UIF 
images to the ISO format there is no logical reason for this besides laziness. 

As the old Axum goes:

   "Garbage in, Garbage out"

                              Miscellaneous Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please Note The Following:

.I.
The NFO Creation and repackaging of this application took Two hours of unpaid 
labour.

a torrent by jcokerjim and he should receive all the prestige his release 
entails. We have released this version without his permission for the purposes 
of ensuring the accessibility of this release. If you wish to thank him he can 
be reached through The Pirate Bay Comments Section of his release (http://thep
iratebay.org/tor/3928857/Roxio_Easy_Media_Creator_10_Suite_Genuine___Keygen).  
.III.
I am ZKZ. 
I am an INDEPENDENT member of the FEDERATION group. 
Props to the scene.

This project has consumed most of my time (as well as the time of both the 
Gamer Girl 2 and SallySef) thereby explaining my recent absence from the 
scene and the forums. This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)
Vista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related 
applications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game 
images and roms in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user 
to easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would 
act as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge
undertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with 
the first real replacement for consoles. This will be released within two 
months.

haspromised to keep the updates coming and I will return to the scene for a
