,sumdumnam,2008-08-21T08:14Z,"serious sync issues here people.  i call nuked.  there's a serious nasty pop in the audio somewhere in the first 10 minutes, after which the video gets ahead of the audio for a few minutes, until around 0:13:23, when there's a blip in the video and the a/v sync is good again.  looks like someone cut'n'pasted half a second of video to resync the movie!  what f'''ing amateur released this cr''??"
