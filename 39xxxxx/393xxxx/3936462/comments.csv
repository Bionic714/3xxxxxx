,doriansend,2007-12-17T11:19Z,"Thanx a lot man! Worked perfectly!!! Now if I can only get my Garritan library to work with it. If anyone else here uses Garritan please let me know if you know of any solutions to ""register"" the garritan library with Kontakt....apparently it seems to be a bug that hasn't been compatible since Kontakt 2.0....thanx again."
,SlyK,2007-12-18T15:34Z,"Please, where i can find win patch?? ! :("
,Tuxtla,2007-12-21T16:16Z,Thanks - the stand alone works but the AU doesn't load in DP 5. Does the AU work for anyone?

,blast1126,2008-01-04T23:54Z,This patch does not work past the demo period (at least for the RTAS .dpm plug). Good try though. Lunabomber...tell the creator of this patch to go back to the drawing board! ;)
,rifkarachman,2008-01-26T20:04Z,"yaa bomber
for me it also worked for few days,
but suddenly after few minutes the warning comes out saying that it's illegal product or something

any solution..?

thanks!"
,Lunabomber,2008-02-11T21:13Z,"well im still using it and it works fine. make sure you dont run the service centre and run each patch. this works fine on tiger and leapord. if your having problems try doing it again, maybe unplug from the internet while you install it. gosh i dont know"
,blast1126,2008-02-23T22:23Z,"Lunabomber...which format of the plug are you using? RTAS, VSTi, or AU?"
,Megatherion01,2008-02-24T21:45Z,"Yeah, this crack doesn't work properly. It failed after a few weeks on my system."
,Lunabomber,2008-03-11T19:05Z,"yeah sorry guys, looks like there is a problem, but i'm not sure whats going on. you can try to run it witout internet connection perhaps. "
,rifkarachman,2008-03-13T04:39Z,"Tried it but still the warning came out.
Anyway thanks for sharing this.
Let's all of us try finding a way to fix this,
because this app is really great..!"

,LarryG,2008-06-08T22:59Z,"Installs fine, patches fine, but than only runs for about 10 minutes before a window comes up saying that 'this copy is unregistered' and than shuts down.

So no the patches don't work.

Oh and for djzobde, here's where you can find the Kontakt dpm

Hard drive/ library/ applications support/ digidesign/ plug-ins

the dpm is a protools plugin."
,chutzpan,2008-08-19T00:42Z,"I can only apply ""app no key"" from the total of four patches. All of the others say I can't run that very patch on the current Kontakt player app. 

Any ideas?"
,Alucarde,2008-11-02T23:21Z,"I downloaded this in hopes to get it to work with Sibelius 4, it didnt work.......  Does anybody have the Kontakt Player Silver or Gold for Sibelius 4  ??????

,userxcd1,2009-10-15T00:01Z,I don't want to open it till I clone my system so I don't loose it if it expires. Does anyone have a better patch or of the program for OSX that works reliably?
,1980nick,2009-11-15T17:28Z,"There is a 3.5 upgrade floating around for osx, its the au and standalone, its awsome patched by team D*******S, remember if you like the software or make money from it buy it or karma will turn your table, then you may say once again why me?......;-)"
,BloodmanO,2010-11-24T23:44Z,"Hi Does anybody have the Demo for Kontakt 3?
