Straight from the mind of Swedish hellraiser Psilodump, who's released on super-smart labels such as 8bitpeoples and Micromusic, as well as being part of the rather smart X-Dump collective, 'Jag Och Psilodump' is a spectacularly eclectic 6-track EP which bounces all over the map, showcasing Psilodump's distinctly weird, distinctly different stylings.

Things start with 'Winds (Snabber Mix)', which is all hyper-fast drums and oddly burlesque melodies, before 'Omtanke7' cuts in, again with oddly indescribable, almost demo-scene styled melodies, before the almost junglist 'Jag Hatar Psilodump' hangs around, all vicious. It only gets better from there on out, ending in a military deconstruction of 'Winds' by fellow X-Dump colleague and former Monotonik releaser Dorothy's Magic Bag. Mommy, we're scared...
