I am dropping my seeding for now to start another torrent.  

I Hope you guys continue to seed.  

If you are into this type of music you are either part of the dance community or a hard core musician.  It is hard to get tango music so please consider making this one of the torrents you keep in your seed list."

Thanks!"
,szmurlor,2008-03-28T15:42Z,"This is truly a collection of great tango classical compositions. 

I have downloaded it yesterday and going to seed it for the rest of dancers and musicians communities.

Thanks a lot Gods-Flaw and other seeders!"
