Dubfire - RibCage 2007 [Tech House / Minimal Techno]


Well... we certainly are very pleased with Dubfire's recent makeover of UNKLE's "Hold My Hand" (which can be found on the schedule if you might have missed it).


...and I've certainly been very pleased also, with this beautiful monster progressive techno creeper...

" After a string of ultra-successful releases and remixes over the past years, Martin Buttrich and Loco Dice decided to launch their very own imprint Desolat.

Dubfire aka Ali Shirazinia, a very good friend of Dice and part of the worldfamous duo Deep Dish, serves up the start release 'Ribcage', which is a super-groovy tech house kicker and a pathbreaking start release at the same time. Grab your copy now and clear some space in your box for a new upfront label. "

I've been using this track quite a lot recently as a smoking accessory, and it also makes for an absolutely wonderful opening to any progressive or tech house / minimal techno set.


Enjoy and please seed.
