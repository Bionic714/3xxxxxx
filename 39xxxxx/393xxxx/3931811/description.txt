Release Notes:

Live In London, England @ The O2 Arena
"First Reunion Show In Over 20 Years"
12-10-2007
T|K

Taper: Slowburn

Taper Source: DPA 4061 -> Microtracker 24/48

Taper Location: Section 407, Row J

Taper Notes:
This is not the best recording I have ever made. Not even close.
Section 407 is all the way up in line with the ending of the
floor. Fortunately I managed to move down from the second to last
row which was considerably higher up than row J. Since this show
is what it is I assume most can live without perfection for
awhile. I'm sure better sources will turn up but this is
listenable and will give you a great feel for the show.

1. Security was lax to say the least. They checked tickets and
wristbands and felt through outer pockets but nothing serious. No
metaldetectors. Funniest thing all night was a x-ray (airport
luggage model) machine standing in the middle of the floor where
you picked up your tickets. They made som people put their bags
through while there was a 100 feet or more free passage around it
where 99% just walked through.

2. There were a few empty seats here and there. Most were probably
just people walking around or going to the bathroom but a few were
empty all night. That's how we managed to move down about 15 rows
from the second to last row under the ceiling.

3. I normally boycott these big shows so I don't know how common
it is with big screens in this quality. From where we were sitting
it made a huge difference to the show. It was also a well used
screen. Obviously different themes and old footage had been
selected in advance and it was well executed. The screen was as
wide as a European hockey rink plus a few meters. Very big.

4. The opening acts all used Bill Wymans Rhythm Kings as house
band. This meant they were all done in about 70 minutes. While
that was about 60 min to long for most it was still brief enough
for most to live thru.

5. There was not a single t-shirt available after the show. Most
were gone before the show. The huge merchandise booth lookied
funny with the walls almost empty. Obviously they had sold the
shirts pinned to the wall as ads. This must have been the biggest
grossing merchandise per visitor ever.

6. I got my ticket through the lottery but not until about 10 days
before the show. Was probably among the last that got in.

7. I obviously put alot of thought into taping or not taping. I
guess I just figured that with all the attention given to the
ticket situation they would have had little time to deal with
extra security. I was right about that. My rig is very stealthy as
well so it wasn't that hard. I've never been caught in hundreds of
taping situations so it would have been bad luck if it had
happened this time though.

8. I would like to give props again to butterking and the JEMS HQ.
Also to calrust for coming up with my nick. I think his suggestion
was slowtrade. Have no idea why :-) Finally, although I don't know
him personally a special thanks to persic for all the fantastic
torrents the last couple of years.

Ripper Notes:
Ooops, Look at me, appearently I'm taking full credit again by
properly encoding to vbr and taggin this rip while adding who
taped this show, and his taping information. You bootlegers who
complain are so pethetic, get over yourself, I will never stop, so
shut up about it.

Quality Rating: A- (Distant)
Enjoy another quality release from Xplicit Bootlegs!
