DOCTOR ZHIVAGO - 1965

  David Lean focused all his talent as a maker of epic films on Boris Pasternak\'s sweeping novel about a doctor-poet in revolutionary Russia. The story is basically about a poet/physician (Omar Sharif) who loves two women--his adoring wife, Tonya (Geraldine Chapin), and his enigmatic mistress, Lara (Julie Christie)--through the events of World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the brutally repressive communist regime.
  The cinematography is spectacular!
