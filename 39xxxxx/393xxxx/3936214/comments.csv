,budman07,2009-02-02T22:53Z,"hey thanx man, i was looking for this, and i hope it is loud, thats how i usually listen to my music anyways hope it works"
,HANDHELDxPROPANE,2009-04-15T07:38Z,"this is great, thanks.
the only problem is that the albums that have songs from the greatest hits album, those songs dont go to the album they belong to. instead they form the greatest hits album. this leaves some albums missing a few tracks.

i honestly thought there would be a lot more songs than 132."
,Fireholder,2009-06-11T19:16Z,"Queen, what was your source for all of these. Did you rip them yourself or just compile them into albums from different sources?"
,stevemonk,2009-06-15T00:46Z,Fuck I can't wait
,nickguyatt,2009-06-23T17:14Z,Good up.
,rara_avis,2009-09-03T04:45Z,"Man, the bitrate is at 128 kbps @ 44 kHz, although the quality is still alright. 

133 songs in 13 albums.

Nice, i used listen to them on mtv when i was a teenager, and i used to dream about that model in the ""jaded"" video and i still do :) ."

,E.Sol,2010-03-04T23:14Z,no it's not. they released a blues album called honkin on bobo. one of my favorites and possibly one of the best
,miss_understood666,2011-11-26T17:16Z,"Great upload, can't see the problem reported by HANDHELDxPROPANE  (fixed?). Thanks!"
