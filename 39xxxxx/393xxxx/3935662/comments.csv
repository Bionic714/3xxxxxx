,tchunksdog,2008-06-05T23:07Z,"hey, sorry, i'm kind of a noob...but how do i mount it? what does that mean? i downloaded this and a few other games and they come up as .iso. is there a program i need for that?"
,xGothicAngelx,2008-06-06T03:54Z,"@tchunksdog
Yes you need a software to mount the .iso file.
Mount means that it tricks the computer into thinking that the iso file is a file being read by a cd-drive.

You can use Daemon tools to work with it."
