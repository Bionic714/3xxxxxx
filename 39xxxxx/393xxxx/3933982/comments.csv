,havoc89,2007-12-15T04:53Z,If this works I will love you forever.  Daemon tools pro advanced version 218 just freezes when it starts up and the other torrents for this game require it to emulate and IDE drive or something.  Regular daemon tools works fine for me though and  I believe that is that this torrent needs :D.
,T3RR0R,2007-12-15T09:25Z,"yep it worked perfectly for me, and my friends."
,bspus,2007-12-16T15:15Z,How come this version is 1GB less than the others? Is it missing something? Like the intro or other videos? I hope not
,T3RR0R,2007-12-16T22:31Z,"Nope its the Entire cd.
ripped off the cd bit by bit."
,bezza16,2007-12-17T02:09Z,Seed please
,jakesm1,2007-12-17T17:49Z,Please seed or as of 12-17-07 this will stop at about 51%.
,T3RR0R,2007-12-18T01:50Z,"I'm seeding as fast as i can which is around 40 kb/s
so please be patient "
,carlcmc,2007-12-18T01:52Z,Why should I download if you won't seed to full 100%? Everyone is stuck at 57%. If you care about your torrent get on and seed.
,carlcmc,2007-12-18T01:52Z,"Additionally, you should set your upload to upload lowest availability first."
,jakesm1,2007-12-18T04:19Z,"T3RROR - I understand - 40-50 kb/s up is about my fastest too.

carlcmc - what does setting your upload to upload lowest availability first do?"
,sane_1,2007-12-18T04:56Z,"don't worry guys super seeder is here, jk but i have it at 100%. and will seed at like 600kbs"
,jakesm1,2007-12-18T05:09Z,"sane_1 - good to have your help.  your 600 kb/s is needed.  once i get 100% i'll seed it for a couple of weeks non-stop.  of course, that's still only at 40 kb/s, but every little bit helps. "
,T3RR0R,2007-12-18T06:30Z,"yeah sorry guys im trying.
Sane is my friend irl. so he's helping out"
,T3RR0R,2007-12-18T06:34Z,"*carlcmc 

The only reason i can only seed to 40 kb/s is because thats all that my ISP allows me to do. Swbell=shit
guys gotta remember, your getting this for free :), it works, you'll get it be patient guys."
,MadsTN,2007-12-19T19:21Z,"Doh.. Was at 95,5% and it stopped, not good at all"
,MadsTN,2007-12-19T19:42Z,"Um, Terror - could you please seed? ;o.. 
well, i've got a 20m/bit internet connection, and downloading with about 4kb/s :s?. And sometimes and I can't even download with anything! could you please fix the problem, would be nice tho ;o !!"
,skullywully,2007-12-19T21:57Z,"Everyone's hanging out at 97.3. Almost there, and then we'll have a good slew of seeders. 

If we make it, that is."
,MadsTN,2007-12-19T21:59Z,"i'm at 97% atm, downloading with b/s.. "
,sane_1,2007-12-20T01:26Z,sweet now we got some more seeders
,havoc89,2007-12-20T02:09Z,"Has anyone gotten this to work, because all I see in the rar is the .mdf and I think it needs an .mds.  Or am I missing something?"
,T3RR0R,2007-12-20T02:38Z,"you can either use Alcohol 120% or daemon tools, on daemon tools
do this
1) Click the icon next to your clock/running programs
2)right click Virtual Cd/DvD-ROM
3)Mount image
4)Click the file of file types to ""all Files (*.*)
5) then browse to your area where you have the MDF located, mount it, if it doesnt start automaticly go to your computer and click ""the Witcher""
6) after installing, take the cracked file out of the crack section 
7)Run ""C:\Program Files\The Witcher\system""
8)Replace it.
9)run.
10) Enjoy.
(this is how my friends and i had done it. should work)
I don't know what will happen if you register it! So i suggest NOT to. 
thanks guys."
,lacabrinator,2007-12-20T04:45Z,"Does anyone know if this is the US version, which is censored? I'd rather it not be."

,Rumour,2008-08-01T00:26Z,"GOOD NEWS PEOPLE!!

THERE IS NO NEED TO INSTALL DAEMONS TOOLS TO PLAY THE WITCHER TO GET AROUND THE TAGES PROTECTION SYSTEM.

The story goes like this I've played about a quarter of the way through The Witcher on an older computer using Daemon Tools Advanced and decided it was time to get a more powerful games system. 

The problem was my new computer (probably the OEM installed drivers) refuses to play with the latest DTA. My system hangs when it is installed (the STPD problem) and I can't even get to the desktop unless I uninstall DTA in safemode.

Woe me ...woe me I will never get to finish the Witcher. Damn, and it was good too. I tried everything to try and get DTA to work but to no avail (and I know my situation is not unique- just google Daemon tools+system hangs, among other problems). Soon the Witcher was becoming a distant memory...a happy memory.

That was until I updated my copy of UltraISO to ""UltraISO Premium Edition version 9.3.0.2600"". I know for a fact that my older 9.1 version could not play it in its one virtual drive (I think it was more designed for playing DVD.iso's than getting around games protections).

I was able to install The Witcher to my hard drive (load the .iso into the virtual drive and press the magnifying glass symbol by the side to autoplay The Witcher.iso). I then updated it to v1.2 patch and replaced the witcher.exe with a no-cd crack.  

I have no idea why it was able to work as UltraISO is not a dedicated games .iso emulator like DTA. BUT IT WORKS...DAMN IT...IT WORKS.

No more DTA for me. In contrast UltraISO is non-invasive on your system and I've had no incompatibility problems or issues with it at all.

NOTE: I'm not sure if Witcher.mdf format works with this program so play it safe and use a rip that is a Witcher.iso. I downloaded this copy of UltraISO with a serial no. You can get it anywhere on the web: most torrents. 

I won't divulge the exact site simply because there are some silly fuckers out there who think it's a great idea to start forum threads with good sites names posted all over it. Over exposing good non-torrent sites and getting them shut down in the process. 

Hail me for I am the new King...long live the KING...long live the King!.

BTW I got my version of The Witcher from

(just for reference)

I will spam the other Witcher torrents to spread the good news."
