+-+-+About+-+-+
Set in a world created by best-selling Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, The Witcher combines spectacular action and an intriguing storyline. You are a Witcher, a warrior who has been trained to fight since childhood, subjected to mutations and trials that have transformed you. You earn a living killing monsters, and are a member of a brotherhood founded long ago to protect people from werewolves, the undead, and a host of other beasts. The game uses advanced graphics and physics systems for a high-powered blend of brutal action, complex RPG options and character configuration, and sweeping storytelling.
