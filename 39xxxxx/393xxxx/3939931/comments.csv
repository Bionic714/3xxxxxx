,groove420,2008-01-27T00:25Z,"Firstly,Thank you for uploading this...

There's a problem with VTS_01_7 (440,340 KB)
I've downloaded this 3 times, and the file is indeed corrupt...
It would be super if niunclavel would re-upload this partial file to make this DVD 100% perfect...

,mrstrix,2008-01-30T19:32Z,"I have been waiting for the Theatrical Version for a long time, THANKS !!"
,sharlzg,2008-02-15T23:14Z,You are my favourite person in the world right now!!! I'm not a fan of the DC and have been trying to get the original version for sooo long (think it's ridiculous that they expect us to buy the 5 disc ultimate box set just to get it... and I don't want to pay $80ish just to get the 1 disc that I want!!)
,TheBigHase,2008-10-27T11:19Z,That film is one of my all time favs! Never understand why there wasn't a sequel like in so many others cases!? Well...
,crazyteknohed,2008-12-09T12:39Z,...because sequels are always sh*t?
,elfkkk,2009-01-20T07:34Z,"Hi, Niunclavel!

That's a great post, Man!

You're the Best!!!

But please, answer me:

There's no portuguese subtitles on this disc?

,vaderfet,2009-07-25T00:36Z,"Warning: if you want to see the U.S. or International versions because of the original gum-shoe narration, do not download this.

It's missing from both and is probably because of corrupt (or completely removed) audio files.
"
,nightprowler.,2010-02-23T16:24Z,"Can anyone confirm or deny what vaderfet said about the Narration? It seems unlikely to me as it is the point of including the original US version, and niunclavel mentions it in the description."
,TargetBoy,2010-04-08T14:36Z,"Tragically this doesn't have the 'Deckard Narration'.
I'm gutted as it was the reason I wanted this download. I have the directors cut which I bought not knowing it didn't have the voice over and i really don't like it.

Shame, I was really looking forward to this. "
,filevans,2012-01-26T16:57Z,"does anyone here know how to use a dvdplayer?!

please don't listen to these reprobates, IT DOES HAVE THE NARATION and it's COMPLETE

you just have to change the language track to the 4th one down, as there are 4 English Tracks (2 & 5 channels ones along with various other languages) and the 4th one contains all the naration

very unfortunate as these completely inaccurate comments  have left this torrent unsupported and unseeded, as people don't bother to download it after that, very sad"
,filevans,2012-01-26T17:01Z,"thanks a lot niunclavel for uploading this, been looking for ages for the original US theatrical version.

all other torrents that say they are the original theatrical cut are all mislabelled and are in fact the international cut (and in some cases even the directors cut) people have not got a clue

thanks a lot!!! brilliant work"
