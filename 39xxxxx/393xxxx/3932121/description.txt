In the late 1980s, Shirley Horn returned to recording by signing with Verve and releasing a series of excellent albums in the classic vocal jazz mold. This impressive compilation brings together the highlights from her Verve releases through the mid-2000s.

Horn has a voice of great focus and expressiveness, which seems--surprisingly--to have improved with age. Whether on the easy jive of "Come and Dance with Me," her sensual take on "Fever," or the beautiful "You Won't Forget Me" (which features Miles Davis on trumpet), BUT BEAUTIFUL: THE BEST OF SHIRLEY HORN overflows with the artist's charms. Three bonus tracks, recorded live in 2005, round out this set of modern-day treasures.

Personnel include: Shirley Horn (vocals, piano); Miles Davis, Roy Hargrove, Wynton Marsalis (trumpet); Alan Broadbent (piano); Harvey Mason (percussion).
