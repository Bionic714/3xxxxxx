,leomutt123,2007-12-16T01:05Z,try here kjappis http://www.wiinja.com/utils/wu4.rar
,babylaton,2007-12-16T16:20Z,i hear you have to put 1.9b on befor 1.9g however i put 1.9g and it seemd to work 
,Barker91,2007-12-16T16:49Z,but to be sure everything works correctly you should install 1.9b just to be safe.
,Barker91,2007-12-16T17:02Z,"i mean ""just to be sure"" :P sorry. crappy english"
,riti,2007-12-16T19:21Z,Do I need a GC controller for updating the Wiikey
,riti,2007-12-16T19:22Z,Is it a problem to use DVD+R
,Barker91,2007-12-16T20:05Z,"no. you dont need a gc controller. you can navigate with the reset button. press it quick to go down one step and hold it down to enter (on the config disc 1.3) but when you update it says ""press A or reset""."
,Barker91,2007-12-16T20:06Z,well i haven't tested to use a DVD+R but it is not recommended because it wears down on the laser in the wii and games are more likely to work on DVD-R
,Shorty1038,2007-12-16T21:07Z,"Well i tryed using 1.9b cuz its endoresed by Wiikey
But SMG wouldnt run
So i used 1.9g and now i cann play SMG with no problem."
,Barker91,2007-12-16T22:40Z,thats what 1.9g is for :) to play SMG ^^
,babylaton,2007-12-17T11:49Z,"ok barker please just tell me if this is correct update wii to 1.9b then update to 1,9g then insert config disc and turn region override on cheers"
,Barker91,2007-12-17T18:40Z,you got it right man ;)
,junglepop,2007-12-18T04:21Z,Do I need to filechop / fixsize the iso before burning or can I just burn it directly ?
,Barker91,2007-12-18T16:30Z,burn directly ;)
,CoolHandSE,2007-12-22T18:46Z,"I did the upgrade to 1.9b and then the upgrade to 1.9g and I still cannot play SMG, I can play everything else. 
Both upgrades said they were successful and I pressed reset after the upgrades were finnished.
Is there anything else I need to do or anything to check in order to get SMG working?
thanks"
,Barker91,2007-12-28T17:04Z,"yes. if it is wrong version for you wii (if you wii is PAL and the game is NTSC or vice versa)
you have to change it in the setup disc. check the gcos disk i have posted:) boot it up and set the ""Region Override"" to ON"
,cristcv4,2008-01-03T04:04Z,its the same to burn it on a cd or a dvd??
,nico09,2008-01-03T08:56Z,"My Wii version is  3.0E PAL, and i want to ask something cus  im not sure what to do and you Barker91 seem to be like the right guy to ask. Do i have to update the 1.9b before i update  to 1.9g?
And i downloaded your torrent (this and the wiikey setup thing) should i make an image file from the files that i unrar or just burn the files in nero ISO DVD?
Thanks for your help in advance."
,Gortie,2008-01-03T18:21Z,I'm confused (it's a chronic state). Is this an update for a specific modchip? Or is it the official Nintendo updates for the Wii console - the ones you download directly to the console (assuming you have internet hooked up to it)?
,cooljunior,2008-01-03T21:33Z,"hur och vart får man tag i recovery disc-en?
Mitt wii blev semi-brickat och jag måste försöka uppdatera om det.
Det var super mario galaxy som brickade det fast inte PAL som mitt wii har så det uppdaterade fel och nu har jag två väderkanaler och wiiet kan inte läsa nybrända spel...

(Where can i find the recovery disc for 1.9g? my wii is ""semi-bricked"" cant read new burned games and has two weather channels..need to recovery, i did format wii system memory but it still doesnt work.)"
,nico09,2008-01-04T10:36Z,"this is update to wiikey modchip, NOT in wii system."
,Gortie,2008-01-04T14:58Z,"Ok, thanks nico. :)"

,acore,2008-02-13T03:12Z,"more questions
where caan you get wiikey
will it screw with my wii in any way cuz when i update my wii it says the update might not work if i have other software or something."
,doofy440,2008-02-28T08:42Z,"hey barker i got a question

i upgraded my wii key to 1.9b then 1.9g

then i was reading some of your comments about PAL vs NTSC

is it possible to switch the ""region free"" thing after the 2 updates i just did?

to my understanding i should have done the ""region free"" thing first then the updates,,, ugh"
,spystyle,2008-03-05T18:33Z,"THANK YOU

Worked on a USA WiiKey. I had original firmware and I updated straight to 1.9G, I did not mess with 1.9B at all. Immediately after I ran Super Mario Galaxy (USA) and let it install an update - all works fine :) SMG and an old game are also working just fine. I will post in here if there are any games that stop working, but ""so far so good"". By the way, the update had a picture of a woman's ass on it. Embarrassing if your wife or child are in the room when you pop in the update."
,spystyle,2008-03-05T18:41Z,"Oh by the way - I use only Ritek G05 disks for gamecube and wii, which are both fussy systems. And I always burn with Nero @4X"
,doofy440,2008-03-05T22:55Z,"i updated my wii-key to 1.9g, right after i toss in SMG, it recognizes the game and u hear mario yell ""SUPER MARIO GALAXY"" sounds good right?

i click start, the screen goes black and im just waiting for the nintendo ""warning about hitting stuff with your wii remote"" but all i get is that the disc cannot be read, so i eject it, and toss back in, and i get the same mesage over and over

i burned using nero 4x speed and the iso is for USA... which is where i am so yeah

any help?"
,tuurtnt,2008-03-10T20:10Z,"Latest wiikey firmware:

,Barker91,2008-03-24T17:25Z,"to doofy 440.

you have to enable regionfree option in the config disc. download it and burn with IMGBURN at 4x. might work with other burningsoftware but IMGBURN is the safest. use dvd-r not dvd+r. this is best for the laser:)"
,echau3832,2008-04-03T20:31Z,I need help urgently.  The power went off in the middle of upgrading wiikey v1.9b.  Now my wii console can not read any disk even the original.  Does any one know what I need to do to fix this problem.  Thanks
,Barker91,2008-04-16T18:17Z,"ok echau.
download a recovery disc for wii and put it into your wii. you wont see that it is recovering but it is. put it in, start the wii up, and let it be for 10 minutes and DONE:D"
,eebi,2008-05-23T14:11Z,"how about this:
1. i unrar the file
2. unrar the uptade i want to use
3. copy the ISO to SD card

i wonder would that work??"
