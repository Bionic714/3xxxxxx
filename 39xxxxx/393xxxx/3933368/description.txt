Meet the Gimp! is a weekly video podcast or tutorial about the Gimp graphics software from the viewpoint of a digital photographer. More information at http://meetthegimp.org


This week I go out of my comfort zone and cover the Unsharp Mask. I never found time to get into that thing. Black Art I thought - and well, it is a bit.
But I had a good guide, Joel?s Blog told me everything I needed to know. So this show is basically a blatant rip off. ;-)
