,earthdragon921,2008-10-21T05:51Z,"Why are these pictures in a rar archive? Unzipped the folder is less than a megabyte larger. Trying to compress already highly compressed data (eg jpeg files) never yields good ratios. It only serves to force people to install additional software, expend additional cpu cycles, and not be able to download a few images first to sample the quality.

Aside from the above the sets are pretty awesome."
,mccorkle,2009-06-15T16:08Z,"in re: to earthdragon921, if a torrent is going to have thousands of files, it is much less work for your filesystem (both windows and linux, not sure about mac) to write one big file instead of 1000s of smaller ones, so this might be why so many do this. Either way, its obvious Anna is hot and what's 375MiB amongst friends?"
