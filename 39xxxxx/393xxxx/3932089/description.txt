  Om Gary Pozner
Pozner broke into the music industry by working with fellow Brooklynites FULL FORCE, producing the seminal rap record Roxanne Roxanne by UTFO, then going on to become a staff writer/ producer/programmer for their label, Select Records. Simultaneously, he was moonlighting as a keyboard player in the dance music scene with DJ/producer Arthur Baker, working on records for The Gypsy Kings, Roberta Flack, Debby Harry, Bernie Worrell, and Sid Straw. Gary Pozner then moved into the major labels as the producer of Virgin Records first Rap Recording Artists, VELORE & DOUBLE O. While playing keyboards for Ziggy MarleyÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s first record Consious Party, Pozner met former Talking Heads members Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth. He went on to become a member of their own group, TOM TOM CLUB, playing synthesizer and keyboards on their popular album Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom, as well as their legendary 15-night run at CBGBÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s in Manhattan, when Tom Tom Club oversold the club to audiences including Debbie Harry and members of Television and the Ramones. Eventually, Tom Tom Club hit the road, opening for the Grateful Dead and Fine Young Cannibals, as well as sharing a bill with U2, Keith Richards, and Robert Palmer. Most recently he was seen playing with Mimi Goese & Timbila I edited my profile with Thomas\' Myspace Editor V4.4
