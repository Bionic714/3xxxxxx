,Tanker76,2011-02-05T23:58Z,"I got it to run ok on Win XP pro SP3 (Crashed a few times) by setting it to run on win98 compatibility.

Can't get it to run on my 64bit Win7 computer though, i will keep trying and post my findings."
,Tanker76,2011-02-06T00:07Z,"With XP i had to use task manager to end the ""Gearhead Garage"" application on the apps tab, then the game would load (Dunno why its doing that).

And with Win7, i got nothing. It just sits there frozen when you try launching the game."
,Dufuzsky,2011-03-04T00:16Z,"Installed it on my HP with W7.. Install goes fine, so as the patches. But when I try to start it, it just stops working. And when I ""kill"" the process, it says: ""Configuration is not correct"" or something like that.

Help? :)"
,Tank327,2011-10-14T20:09Z,Downloaded and attempted to install but installation process freezes at setup. Try to close using Task Manager and I get an error that says 16 bit system may be unstable. I really want to play this game again (!!!) Any help would be welcome.
,Tank327,2011-10-14T21:02Z,Anyone manage to fix that 2 minute crash glitch yet?
,Knyte6426,2012-04-19T20:36Z,"For Win 7:

Make a shortcut to GHG.exe and make the properties:  ...Gearhead_Garageghg.exe -mustbehere -nosound."
