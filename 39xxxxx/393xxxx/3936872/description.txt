Documentary concerning the large aquifer in the four border
area of South America, the World Bank, Militarization and
Globalization.

Quote from movie
The next war will not be about oil, it will be about water.

This documentary is in Spanish (some Portuguese) but there
is an English subtitles text which will play if WinAmp or
MediaPlayerClassic is used.

The subs could use some improvement in synch but the story
is there.
