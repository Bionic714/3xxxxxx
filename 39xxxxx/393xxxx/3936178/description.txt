First time presentation:
                                           
THis is the first of 54 episodes/long-films about the feared and hyper intelligent Hercule Poirot from
1989-Present, convincing performance trough the episodes. (the Latest made episodes are out on DVD March in  2008,)

 If you like traditional but different crime-series, this might be it. For those of you who knows
 POirot allready, 
Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

 I will decode all episodes/films to AVI-format from regular DVD
one by one when I have the time. Hope all downloaders help seed. Mp-4 is the first
one, think its the same as DivX.THe episodeos up to an hour will be about 350mb and the regular ones will
be about 700. All in all the complete collection will stop at about 30gb + -. :)

Merry Christmas!!
