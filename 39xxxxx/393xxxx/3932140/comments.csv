Long live the fan edits!"
,vinegarbowl,2008-01-20T08:26Z,You're a fag for altering the DVD by checking if people have an original copy. Why would I d/l the DVD if I have an original?? Keep ripping and stop altering the DVD. 
,nOmArch,2008-01-29T01:04Z,"its not a rip you numty its a fanedit.  they are completely different things.

go to fanedit.org and become less ignorant.

,CherryxDarling,2009-06-28T00:51Z,So you basically added the deleted scenes to the original movie? That's actually pretty damn cool if so. I'm going to start doing that with my movies from now on hehe. I hate watching deleted scenes by themselves and always wanted to watch them in the actual movie. I will download anyways! 
,CherryxDarling,2009-06-28T01:28Z,Thanks for the link to fanedit.org! That site is seriously awesome. I didn't know what the hell it was at first but now I'm downloading about 4 movies from there. Thanks again!
