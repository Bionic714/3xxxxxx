,PIKOSAPIKOS,2007-12-17T07:00Z,Is this the one with the bad audio?
,FelatioSucks,2007-12-17T08:17Z,"i'm watching it at the moment, about half way through, and it's brilliant. no 'bad audio' so far."
,PIKOSAPIKOS,2007-12-17T09:07Z,"OK. Thanks, i said that because it has the same size from the one on smarttorrent, which the sound was distorted.
This is the best movie i have seen in years!"
,Timeass,2007-12-17T22:51Z,"What a shame, bad audio quality ... =(
Seriously clipping on every song they play

If you really want to enjoy this movie, don't download this version ..
Splendid image quality though !"
[T],CrazyTosser,2007-12-18T21:16Z,"Timeass, check your codecs, everything is OK"
,Timeass,2007-12-19T12:15Z,"No really, I exported the audio with VirtualDubMod and opened it up in MP3Gain, track analysis said 102dB ... If that ain't clipping to you ..
You can fix it though by lowering the volume to around 90dB for optimal sound quality and then overwrite the original sound from the video with the new mp3 file with VirtualDubMod."
,musikastor,2007-12-21T15:44Z,"No, Timeass is right. There's audio clipping after the choir part. It is sporadic, though. I believe it can be edited out and then re-synch with the documentary. A whole editing job in itself 
CrazyTosser, this is a fantastic upload. The video quality is superb. The only problem is the audio clipping after approx. 00:58. Thank you, thank you, thank you"
,musikastor,2007-12-21T15:46Z,"Please, notice I said audio clipping, not overmodulation. The audio level is fine.
Thank you, again."
,daebat,2008-01-15T05:48Z,do i just add all of the files to an iso and mount it or ?
,cgregz,2008-01-26T09:46Z,french subtitles ???
,Spottbroder,2008-05-30T12:40Z,"I'm not having any clipping issues at all.
Thanks alot!"
