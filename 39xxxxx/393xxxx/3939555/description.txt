_____________________________________________________________Summary__

Four Corners tells the story of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, his journey 
from poor beginnings so unlike the scion bin Laden?s, to small time 
criminal and prison thug, finally to emerge as the "Sheik of 
Slaughter", rivalling bin Laden himself in power and symbolism.

Myth and man have been interwoven. Zarqawi used to tell friends about
his sister?s dream in which he prayed to Allah and then a sword came
down to him from the sky. On the sword was written the word "jihad".

His reputation was burnished among Islamist extremists by an
improbable source ? the US. In the build-up to war Washington named 
Zarqawi as a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda - and a justification for
invasion. Since then Zarqawi has been singled out as master of the
insurgency. 

Four Corners reporter Debbie Whitmont profiles Zarqawi, and shows
how the power of myth-making and the Internet have made his name
bigger than the man. She goes to his birthplace to meet his old
friends and confidants, interviews the experts who monitor extreme
Islamists and their websites, and asks if Zarqawi might be
succeeding in his immediate goal: igniting civil war in Iraq.
