,ATPLer,2007-12-13T19:36Z,It's full worldwide coverage by the way and the cycle covers nav database updates up to mid October 2007. Keep seeding plz cause  im gonna have to leave for about 5 days so u guys have to keep this torrent alive after you download till i get back.
,fsfsx,2007-12-13T20:56Z,"Thanks, although I have it."
,ATPLer,2007-12-13T22:12Z,I know you do mate ;-) . You' re one of those great guys that i thank...
,rrsousa,2007-12-14T00:20Z,"Thanks ATPLer, really great job.
For those who already have the 3 discs and werenÂ´t able to get them working, could you possibly up only the crack and info. Tks again."
,epsilon_02,2007-12-14T04:36Z,great! 
,ATPLer,2007-12-14T09:26Z,"Those who already have the cds, can just download disk 2 (0720JVGB_2) and the .txt file . The crack is integrated in disk 2, disk 1 and program disk are the same disks that circulate the internet for a few months now. I would appreciate if you just download the disks instead of me adding just the crack cause i would like to spread this torrent for those who dont know how to extract .isos and repack files + i have my final ATPL exams in 3 days. However, if i see that many people need just the crack, i will post it on a website with info when im done wit the exams next week( I have to repatch the file cause it wont be integrated to a cd). In the meantime, plz keep seding after you are done at least for a week or smthn. Thanks"
,rrsousa,2007-12-14T14:15Z,"Tks for the repply, hoping you succeed in your exam. "
,ATPLer,2007-12-14T15:03Z,Thx :-)
,ATPLer,2007-12-14T16:28Z,"Seems that Jeppesen has covered every possible scenario :-( . It appears that the approach plates lock once the database is 10 weeks old so that means that in order to be able to see them, you will have to set the date in your pc a few days back. The lockup occured today so tough luck guys, im gonna try and get around this one."
,ATPLer,2007-12-14T19:31Z,"Ok, didnt take long to work out a solution... If you cant see the approach plates, just go and download this file:

,yoerilebon,2007-12-15T12:52Z,"Hi, i can't open the .txt file
I don't have access to it, someone a solution. Or what do i have to do with the config file? Already a lot of thanks for the post."
,yanpet,2007-12-15T14:58Z,"@yoerilebon
Change the file C:\Jeppesen\Common\TerminalCharts\Charts.ini with the one from the torrent"
,Guesswhotoo6,2007-12-15T18:46Z,"Anybody have the issue it wants the code R00D-KCAB each time you run either Jeppview or Flitedeck, everything is working but this is a pain in the neck?   

Try FlightSoft, about 1000 times easier to use and cheap enough to afford.  http://www.rmstek.com/

This will connect with a WX box for real-time cockpit weather.   You need the vista option to have moving maps.   The std version also d/l's raster maps.   You can have up to 5 cpu's per subscription (they may not tell you that up front).
Jepp looks good, but cumbersome. 
Thanks for sharing."
,fsfsx,2007-12-15T20:14Z,"Well

I just cannot see it that way but in another.
What I mean that we use that software for simulation, not for real, in that way you must be out of your mind if you use it.
In a perfect world the out of date charts were be free for all, for us simmers especially but in our world WTF...."
,ATPLer,2007-12-15T23:52Z,"@ Guesswhotoo6: That's a nice program that you mentioned... What about those of us though who dont live in the US and were a bunch of people i think... Jeppesen is nr1 mate, everyone else is waaay back. At least thats how i see it.

On a different note, if anyone has access to 0722 cycle of jeppview or later, plz seed it here on piratebay if possible... Dont care about coverage. Seed it here on piratebay if possible plz.

Ok, im off to Athens, wish me luck guys and gals. I hope the release worked for most of you. Cheerz"
,yanpet,2007-12-16T15:44Z,@ Guesswhotoo6: problem with activation  of Jeppview is only with Vista. With XP it works without poblem
,netwummi,2007-12-17T15:43Z,How can i recive a Full world coverage for update Electronic Chart Data? eg. for Disc 23-2007?
,fsfsx,2007-12-17T19:24Z,"Is

the 23-2007 available?


Thank's"
,netwummi,2007-12-17T20:02Z,i have the original cd ... but not coverage code! 
,ATPLer,2007-12-18T00:38Z,"@ fsfsx and @ netwummi : plz give me your msn messenger details at : atpler@trashymail.com
I'd like to talk to both of you..."
,yanpet,2007-12-18T13:00Z,"@netwummi: it's explained in the comments http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3868579/Jeppesen_JeppView_3_Original_ISO_(Disc_20-2007_Issued_5_oct._200
We could tell after we download the torrent for 23-2007"
,netwummi,2007-12-18T17:38Z,"@ATPLer sent mail to you
@yanpet the old version is running but i need a Full world coverage code for  Eleectronic chart data 24-2007 and further. 
No problem for me to put this an further in bittorrent for all."
,yanpet,2007-12-18T20:39Z,"@netwummi: You didn't check my previous link, did you?
""N1NY ? 2007-11-25 02:46 CET: 
For the coverage code, go to the Charts folder on the first CD, open the file sbscrips.dbf in your favorite editor, and scroll all the way to the end. Right before the end, you should see a sequence of 13 letters and numbers (plus one non-printable character). The first 10 of those seem to be the code for worldwide coverage. For cycle 20-07, it would be 229EL10532.""
If you cannot do this yourself send me the file sbscrips.dbf to yanpetrov@hotmail.com"
,netwummi,2007-12-18T21:10Z,"@ yanpet   woooowww yes it works. thank you.

Do you need this update and further?"
,yanpet,2007-12-18T21:18Z,"I'm downloading now 23-2007 (thanks to ps767). If you have 24-2007 and can upload it, that will be great!"
,ATPLer,2007-12-19T00:16Z,"@Netwummi 
I see you sorted this out, so you dont need my help. If you upload the 2 cds of cycle 24, that would be awesome."
,netwummi,2007-12-19T07:03Z,"@ yanpet & ATPLer  I'll put this and all next updates to torrent, or i can send you an copy...
But one, how can I install the 2. CD (Serial isnt running )"
,ATPLer,2007-12-19T11:02Z,"If you upload both disks, i'll have a looksy and let you know if we can work something out with that serial ;)"
,netwummi,2007-12-19T14:48Z,"@ ATPLer

CD 1 is comming soon"
,fsfsx,2007-12-19T17:18Z,"Hi

Is this only the Navdata Update, the second cd or am I wrong.
If it is can we just update the 20 2007 version?"

,joaeropagita,2008-06-16T13:12Z,"The Terminal tab in FliteDeck doesnt open any Terminal charts. I tried some airports, and watched Clipboard, but nothing. Where the problem? Does it work?"
,joaeropagita,2008-06-18T00:42Z,"I found that Jeppview checks date of chart and refuses access to terminal charts that are more than 10 weeks old. But for simulation I don't mind having old charts. I have database on disk but no access to data. What shit, who have thought it up? Can somebody break this protection for us?"
