,shoeshoe,2007-12-13T23:08Z,"HEY FXG,

Could you use your ripping skills to make rips of some great classic/arthouse films? There are a lot of movies like that available, but the rip quality varies widely and there are way too many duds that won't work on my standalone.

I always hoped aXXo would do stuff like that, but he never did.

Maybe do an FXG Classic Series or something."
,rlhowar,2007-12-14T00:21Z,Thanks FXG.. Great work we all owe you guys bigtime!!! You're uploading great movies!
,bc_buds_da_best,2007-12-14T05:32Z,"dope, thx fella's"
,juudu,2007-12-14T10:16Z,btw. Where is axxo?
,killa69966996,2007-12-15T16:51Z,axxo got busted and is in big shit he is going to be sentenced in febuary
,kirre34,2007-12-15T17:15Z,pretty bad quality :/
,Gn2me,2007-12-16T18:49Z,"""""axxo got busted and is in big shit he is going to be sentenced in febuary""""

Your a dumbass... he is only taking a break, but he wont be uploading to TPB anymore.

,germversion,2007-12-23T02:05Z,"I can't believe how terrible this movie is. And the Oscar goes to ""The Heartbreak Kid"" in the category of the worst remake of a film ever made. Even without comparing it to the original, the movie fails miserably in and of itself. I just got out of a showing of the film, where there were some initial laughs, but by halfway through the movie, there was basically dead silence in the theater for the rest of it."
,realaz78,2007-12-25T07:39Z,"i dont give a fuck what u think about the movie. if its good or not. i want to know about the quality of the rip. if its fucking real or not. some of u should be banned from TPB on your comments alone.ive been using TPB and downloading axxo films for years. but ive never seen so many fucking morons and noobs.the movie is a good rip, and i personally laughed my ass off but i did smoke some afghani haze first so............"
,nvidiaamd,2007-12-27T18:13Z,"aXXO has stopped uploading torrents to TPB. he was offended by someone i think. 


FXG is great!  

funny movie!"
,idlehavok,2007-12-29T00:51Z,"damn axxo was arrested, looks like torrent wont be around much longer, at least i hope not!"
,tattoodude75,2007-12-29T14:55Z,"Great quality and all, but why not include subs for movies that need it??? Same as axxo, never included subs for movies that had different speaking laguage parts. Please try to include them in future u/l's. Thanks...."

,CSuk,2008-03-19T22:31Z,Jeez brenJames your so sensitive. I suppose you think anyone cares about your thoughts on aXXo. Personally I think its good to have 2 or more good uploaders like aXXo and the FXG_Team. It means there is more for everyone. Go wash your hair in the toilet so it can reunite with your brain...numbnut!
,dan_man82,2008-03-25T22:51Z,"Great quality 
10/10 but when I trie to convert it to fit it on to a dvd the audio seems to be faster than the movie...

Does anyone has an idea??"
,bajsbulle,2008-04-05T17:25Z,where is AXXO!?
,Kevolution63,2008-05-17T01:07Z,"I downloaded this file and my ISP kicked me for ""illegal file-sharing"". I'm not sure if it's this file that's being watched or just my IP address. Be warned! The file sharing police know about this one."

,vonstussi,2009-02-18T06:26Z,"10/10??? are you kidding.
Sound is fine but it is a ZERO quality movie.
Image is so shitty
aXXo is way better
Level up FXG team and change the rip settings."
,nohworryz,2009-04-05T11:20Z,thanks
,dyingart,2010-01-18T05:27Z,I wouldn't download this. I did and I got a letter in the male from Dreamworks/Paramount about copyright infringement regarding this file. Paramount is monitoring this file!
,dyingart,2010-01-18T05:27Z,Letter in the mail* Anyway you get the point.

,lambofgod1688,2010-05-17T09:39Z,another excellent fxg rip..thnx much uploader..but also i do have to throw in my 2 cents on the axxo convo..fxg team is great and are definitely my top choice now..but b4 axxo gave it up he was the best without a doubt..the greatest of all time in my opinion(so far that is)..the man is a legend and rightfully so
,yelloo,2010-10-11T10:54Z,Thanks FXG_team.
