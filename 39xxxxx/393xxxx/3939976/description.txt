Insects have been around for more than 220 million years. As the centuries go by, they continue to evolve, reinventing themselves and claiming any ecological niche. They are evolution's most successful creation, representing 80% of all the world's animals. Their diversity is unmatched by any other species and their combined mass exceeds that of all mammals. Most importantly, they're the inventors of paper, sonar, chemical warfare, air conditioning, job specialization, and even cattle breeding. INSECTIA is a 13-part documentary series that puts an entertaining spin on the fascinating world of insects. Hosted by the internationally renowned entomologist Georges Brossard, INSECTIA is the ultimate analogy between insects and humans.
