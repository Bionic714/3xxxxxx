The reviews are not wrong.  This is Nick Muir's finest moment in production to date and possibly the best release all year on the Audio Therapy label.


For those who may be unaware, Pig & Dan is a name in the fields of Progressive, Tech and Minimal, spoken with utmost respect... and they really have outdone themselves with this superb remix which I just can't seem to keep away from for too long.
