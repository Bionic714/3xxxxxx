,maineimis,2008-01-21T12:58Z,damn i can't find any cd's from gentle giant :(
,Evil_Laserlord,2008-08-14T00:00Z,"Fucking .ogg! I don't want to complain, you uploaded it and all. But i really don't like to be disappointed by a bunch of files I can't play in my mp3 player when i've heard the lovely pling that means download complete. Really annoying. I'll just keep looking..."
,zaoro,2008-09-24T18:41Z,Use total video converter and don't look back!
,zen-TAO,2008-10-22T06:00Z,"Hey man!

I have listened before,
but did never really ""get it""
if you know what I mean...
Then my best friend said:
Gentle Giant - listen....
He has, like, you know,
about 3000 LP and cds
He knows, man..!

So here I am....

Evil_Laserlord at 2008-08-14 00:00 CET: 
I get your point,
but be grateful for this one,
better than nothing...?

Peace and love!"
,zen-TAO,2008-10-22T06:12Z,"Hey Man!
Fan-tas-tic!

A Thousand Thanks to
gentlegiant666

Great Music!

Any UFO, by the way,
from the ""schenker""-years?
Would be nice....
Video, that is...
The audio I allready have..."
,Bayok,2008-11-16T21:55Z,"Hey GG666 - In my humble opinion the best band ever. Thanks for all the extra stuff in this download, have most but some I have never seen and sure appreciate the effort in putting this together. Now if only we could convince them to get back together for another album!"
,DreamerFK,2010-10-24T00:26Z,"GG666,,,AWESOME post!
Little help though, Could you please seed the Giraffe & Toy Matinee uploads? I've been so very stuck on those for quite some time. TIA"
,Zoiflite,2011-01-17T17:54Z,Thank you very much! GG is the shit! :)
,paulo_c2010,2012-01-12T18:25Z,"Dude, Thanks!!!"
