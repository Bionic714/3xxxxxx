Description:

A bout de souffle - Jean-Luc Godard (1960)

Michel Poiccard, an irresponsible sociopath and small-time thief, steals a car 
and impulsively murders the motorcycle policeman who pursues him. Now wanted by 
the authorities, he renews his relationship with Patricia Franchini, a hip 
American girl studying journalism at the Sorbonne, whom he had met in Nice a few 
weeks earlier. Before leaving Paris, he plans to collect a debt from an 
underworld acquaintance and expects her to accompany him on his planned getaway 
to Italy. Even with his face in the local papers and media, Poiccard seems 
oblivious to the dragnet that is slowly closing around him as he recklessly 
pursues his love of American movies and libidinous interest in the beautiful 
American.
