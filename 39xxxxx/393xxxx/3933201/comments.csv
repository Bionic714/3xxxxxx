,bebopaloo,2008-04-01T19:07Z,"Thanks for this great series.  I just discovered them and am now enjoying them immensely.  

One small request, though... any chance of seeding numbers 6, 8, and 11, as there are about 40 users still trying to download these three from the series?

Again, much thanks for all the time and effort.

Mucho Appreciatedo."
