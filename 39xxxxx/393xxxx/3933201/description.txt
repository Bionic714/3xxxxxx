Moke is a band from Amsterdam with a pure Indie sound. Potato is one of Thailand's most popular bands. The album of Turins Brakes is a bit of a disappointment after their great "jackinabox". Levon Helm (old member of "The Band") has made a very basic and original folk-country album with songs that are telling great stories. The Stephen Stills song is from the album made in 1968 in spare studio time when Stephen would tell the technician to "Just Roll Tape". The Colbie Caillat album seems to have a carefree atmosphere, except for this song... Ozark Henry has made a Best Of. A decade of music of the sometimes called Belgian David Bowie. Holy Fuck has made one of the years best albums called "LP".
