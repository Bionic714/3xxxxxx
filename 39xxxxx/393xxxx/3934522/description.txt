Andrew Strong

Strong:

Unchained dog
Ain t nothin you can do
Same old me
Too many cooks (spoil the soup)
This bitter earth
Do you know what I mean
Are you lonely for me baby
Girl s got rhythm
(She s) Some kind of wonderful
Ain t nothing you can do (Long version)

Gypsy s Kiss:

24 7 Lover
When you open your eyes
Gypsy s kiss
Never been rocked enough
This is my life
It s too late
The last rocket man
Everyone needs a friend
Try me one more time
You really got me
A man needs a woman
I shall be released
The world has changed
When you call
Kings & qeens

Out Of Time:

Out of time
Spinning wheel
Sending me angels
Soul man
Will you still love me tomorrow
Yolanda
Forever young
Long as I see the light
Ain t no mountain high enough
I d rather go blind
It s your thing
Warm and tender love
It s not the spotlight
Nothing can change this love
Born to be wild
