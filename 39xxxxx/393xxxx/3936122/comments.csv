,LSDAddict,2007-12-16T16:51Z,finally thx :D 
,trhisdone,2007-12-16T17:06Z,Sorry for the slow upload but I can't get any faster up speeds here on DSL. I will be putting more movies up at this quality as I convert them. 
,trhisdone,2007-12-16T19:28Z,ok.. I'm not exactly sure what the resolution is because the conversion program says one thing and  VLC says another.  its either 640x320 or 480x320.. either way it's very high quality.. looks good on a 22'' Samsung LCD monitor at fullscreen
,trhisdone,2007-12-18T05:14Z,This is the format iPod plays. I have tested it on a brand new iPod Touch. It is a large files size because it's a high quality high bit rate video. I wanted my movies to look good when I display them on a TV from my iPod. I am not sure about old iPods buy this should work on any current iPod that can play video. 
,Ahrie,2008-01-22T10:15Z,"Converting files is a new thing for me. Any tips on sites that could help me with this? I have a video ipod, but even though the movie plays through itunes, the format isn't supported on my ipod. I know the ipod I have plays mp4s, so my friend said it's the encryption that's causing a problem? Any help would be appreciated. Thx!"
,trhisdone,2008-01-30T06:54Z,"I have only tested this on an iPod Touch and the latest version of iTunes. There is no encryption on this file. The iPod Video is not new so that is most likely the problem. New iPods include the new iPod Nano, iPod Touch, iPod Classic. These are called 5th generation iPods. Try the posted link below for older iPods. "
,trhisdone,2008-02-01T08:48Z,I've downloaded some ipod format movies from psycho2010 and they look fine on the iPod Touch. You don't really need the high bit rate videos I posted unless you want to output to a tv. If you just want to watch on the iPod then lower bit rate videos  are good enough.
