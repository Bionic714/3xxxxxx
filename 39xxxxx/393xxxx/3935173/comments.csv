This is not the final soundtrack  --- this is a ver good rippout of the movie "
,Jioklo,2007-12-20T06:10Z,This is not the soundtrack.  Just a rip of the audio from the film.  Don't bother..
,NINgod,2008-02-10T22:51Z,this a rip from the movie but what you gonna do. it isnt released on cd.
,fuzzyburrito,2008-05-07T21:21Z,"Despite high praise for the score from many fans of the film, a soundtrack for the film is still yet to be officially released, in part due to 'disputes' between the lawyers of Underworld and Fox Searchlight.[41] A soundtrack was still widely expected to be eventually released, until the film's producer Andrew Macdonald stated in a fansite interview that the soundtrack was ""stuck"" and that there were ""no plans to release"" it."
,stvn758,2008-05-16T15:20Z,"Even though this isn't the official soundtrack - that still doesn't seem to be released yet, it is great for those of us who loved the music from this film.

May even be better that the soundtrack when and if it is released as it has the edits where you can hear the actual film - very atmospheric.

Great work to whoever got this done."
,CCI,2008-11-27T20:05Z,"I'm with stvn on this one; there's nothing wrong with the actual quality at All, and any sound from the film is purely atmospheric, no dialogue at all. Really atmospheric. Ignore the above whining , it's not as though they're paying, and this torrent is deff worthwhile.

 (granted, it Shouldn't say OST.)"

ALSO: The actual OST has just been released, but I can't find it yet..."
,hazman543,2008-12-17T15:30Z,the OST has been on iTunes for almost a month. i know it sounds cheap but does anyone have it?
,CCI,2009-01-13T19:30Z,"It's finally here! Official soundtrack, at a rather spiffing 320! http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3838608/Sunshine.Soundtrack.LOLX.rar"
,XenoSilvano,2009-12-15T15:12Z,Yeah stop saying OST!  Can't someone get this off iTunes?
