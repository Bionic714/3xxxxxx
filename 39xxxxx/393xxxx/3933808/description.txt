Just in time for Christmas!  After ┬ú50 (sob) spent on an older version game, several months of struggling with LBA files and ┬ú20 of DVD's, I finally got it right!

Just download, unzip, burn and play - it picks up right where disk 2 left off (The Song of Nephilim).




If you've enjoyed this game and the hard work that's gone into it, please consider visiting my new site : www.freebiefun.fusiveweb.com

It's about how to get free money online, cheap internet shopping, free stuff (like consoles through Affiliate links) and free stuff, like the special Lovefilm code I got that gives you a whole month instead of just two weeks to try it.  End the cost of fun stuff by getting free stuff!

MERRY CHRISTMAS
