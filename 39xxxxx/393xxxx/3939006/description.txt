
Dead Babies X is a homebrew xbox game based off of an elaborate practical joke based off of one hell of a weird SNES puzzle game. The game itself is simple and isn't meant to be taken seriously, but hopefully it can provide at least a few minutes of entertainment for you. The game itself was written as a school project (think high school here people) and within class time constraints to meet a certain level of quality.

Really funny, and kind of fun too.
