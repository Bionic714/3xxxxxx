Fantastic docudrama from BBC. Near impossible to find as a (seeded) torrent.

Well, that was my reason for finding and uploading it - and here it is.

I\\\'ll try to keep it seeded as long as I can. Enjoy.

In 1883, the volcanic island of Krakatoa erupted,
killing 36,000 people and unleashing a series of
terrifying tsunamis.
This spectacular docu-drama, starring Olivia Williams
and Rupet Peny-Jones, uses eye witness accounts to
tell the true story of one of the most destructive
natural disasters in history.
