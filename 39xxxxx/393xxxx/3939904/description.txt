"In 1995, the first gray wolves were transported from Alberta, Canada to Yellowstone National Park, to repopulate the sprawling landscape with the species, absent for more than 70 years. The following year, a second wave of wolves was brought to the park from British Columbia, Canada; five of them were released together, and they were named the Druid Peak pack. Since the arrival of those first immigrants, wolves have thrived in Yellowstone -- and none more dramatically than the Druids. The epic history of the Druids, one of more than a dozen packs now occupying the 2.2 million acres of Yellowstone, is documented in NATURE's IN THE VALLEY OF THE WOLVES. The program was produced and shot in High Definition by Emmy-award winning filmmaker Bob Landis. On the Web site, you'll learn how the successful reintroduction of Yellowstone's apex predator has changed the entire ecosystem of the park, and about the threats that these majestic animals continue to face on their road to recovery."
