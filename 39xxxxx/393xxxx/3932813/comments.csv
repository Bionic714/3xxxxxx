,VeKTeReX,2008-05-17T20:13Z,"Is this the original Japanese ""Iron Chef"" or is this the ""Iron Chef America""?

Both were broadcast in English in the US so i cannot discern from the language."

I'm a happy man today."

,Lagore144,2009-06-28T23:09Z,"GAH!  I wanna download this soooo bad, but it's just enormous.  My wussy computer won't be able to take it.

Are there torrents our there for individual seasons?"
,bongman420,2010-01-31T08:41Z,"@Lagore144 
There were a lot of individual episode torrents a few years back, before Iron Chef America came out..this seems to be the only seeded torrent for the Japanese show now, at least on public trackers.

If you want to just download a few episodes at a time, get a client like uTorrent where you can specify what you want to download."
,HamDaddy,2010-01-31T16:07Z,Seed please!!
,Azm0,2010-09-13T03:39Z,I actually have some original series episodes not listed here.. I'll go through the list and put them up as a separate torrent later. It was a sad day when digital distractions went down.
