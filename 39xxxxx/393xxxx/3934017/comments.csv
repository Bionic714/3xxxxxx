,starfighter69,2008-01-25T05:28Z,this is a nero/cd image so you have to burn it to a cd using your burner program from the image
,oranjepigx,2008-01-28T14:11Z,"This is not fake, it works perfectly, thankyou io2dor. Use one of the serial numbers above."

,Walid16,2008-02-13T20:13Z,how do u install the .bin file and the .cue file? 
,superbision,2008-02-13T23:16Z,"Awsome torrent, keep seeding!
I've used this key 
V2BG6-94CPH-QP2Q9-Y8XTM-X33Q8
and it just runs perfectly!

Thanx! "
,superbision,2008-02-13T23:19Z,"To install it you have to download magicISO, do it with crack, you can find it on piratebay, install it. And burn the .cue file into a disc with the program. 
Hope it works. ;)"
,Ivelisse,2008-02-23T18:52Z,THIS WORK FINE.. THANKS
,haggis56,2008-02-23T23:30Z,"Can i burn it via nero burning rom -same as a vcd, or do I have to use Power ISO?"
,svenp,2008-03-01T11:02Z,Language packs tested with http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3679541/Microsoft_Office_2007_Complete_Third_Edition may be found on http://thepiratebay.org/user/svenp/
,Revanant,2008-03-03T09:03Z,"Thank you! This works GREAT!

To install you need to convert the BIN file to an ISO file (I used MagicISO). Then I used Nero to burn an ISO CD, targeted the newly created ISO, then clicked burn and that was it. Enjoy everyone!

KEEP THE SEED GOING!!!"
,Revanant,2008-03-03T09:05Z,"Like superbison, I too used this key and it works perfect:
V2BG6-94CPH-QP2Q9-Y8XTM-X33Q8

Thanks again, io2dor!!!"
,joshkun,2008-03-06T21:57Z,"Yeh, just to reiterate what other users have said... the torrent does work. However, you must convert the .bin file into an .iso file using the program magic iso. (if u dont hav it, it is easy to get ur hands on) Next, create an iso cd using magic iso (or nero) adding ONLY the .iso file u just converted. Once the cd is burnt, put it back in ur pc and it will load as if it were the original... there are a few lists of the keycodes, but i used this one

V2BG6-94CPH-QP2Q9-Y8XTM-X33Q8

hope this helps"
,JottePD,2008-03-08T16:19Z,Thanks! I've sort of needed this ...

,earjam818,2008-03-18T14:56Z,"Alright, So I'm having a bit of a problem here.  It installs and works perfectly on my computer, that is until I restart my computer.  When I try to access any office program after a restart, it says it hasn't been installed?!? Yet the icons are still in my start menu?  Anybody have an idea what's up with that?"
,standup69,2008-03-28T15:43Z,"I'm kind of new to this and could use some help. I downloaded this and trying to install. None of the Keys work. Do I have to do that conversion thing from BIN to ISO first? If so, how exactly do I do that again?
Thanks"
,Hex23,2008-03-28T18:53Z,"Found an easy way to start instal.

Download MagicDisk, and use that to mount the .cue file.

Now just need to wait to finish the instal!

Great torrent, io2dor, cheers to you, and to everyone seeding! Thanks very much for making this download possible!

Now I'll seed for a bit!"

http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm....(read the directions on how to use it)>Burn your ISO file to a CD>Use one of ""aviator004""s key numbers and....you're in!Note: You will find that when you go to use the ""isorecorder"" program above, that you need to RIGHT click the ISO iconed file and look in the drop down list to burn it to CD. If I recall, I had to do a restart before it showed up in the drop down list. Hope all this works for you. Nice download.Thank you ""io2dor"". "
