[T],JayRay,2008-06-22T20:05Z," Excuse the Negative Quality Numbers (at the upper right, just below the title) but we have an Uploader here at PirateBay who gets jealous everytime someone uploads a title he has uploaded, or wants to upload. So to retaliate he starts messing with the Quality numbers. Those numbers are there to help you the Downloader. But he is now making them useless. And mine aren't the only torrents he's messed with.

Thanks:
JayRay"
,pornju,2008-07-30T11:25Z,Quality is excellent! Thanks!
,gotmog13,2008-10-30T22:19Z,Very good quality. Thanks JayRay!
,AFishaNado,2008-12-26T12:28Z,This downloaded CRAZY fast. Quality's great.  Thanks so much.
,zappoloco,2009-01-19T17:32Z,"Yeah! Download speed is very good, and it makes me feel so goooood that IÂ´ll seed for a long, long time... Longer than usual, I mean, which is already a long time :) "
,intangiblef,2010-01-14T03:54Z,"Aspect ratio comes out to 1.61:1.  It has a black frame around the picture, so I'm pretty sure this should be resized to 16:9 (1.78:1), as it seems to have come straight off the DVD."
,Spoekenkieker,2010-04-07T19:39Z,"video/audio = 7/8  (that means very good)
thanx to the seeders, downloaded in 15min

btw, this movie (info at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063462/) is way better than the remake

thank you JayRay"
,BinkyDeath,2010-05-17T05:32Z,"Thanks for the note about the negative numbers.  You have about five negs on every one of your uploads - does that sad loser use five different accounts just to make things difficult.  I can't even imagine what kind of a loser would devote all of his time to making people's torrents look bad just so people download his.  Tons of hours in the hope of a couple of greatful posts for a torrent because he's upset someone may have uploaded a better copy?  Yeesh.
You always put up good torrents man.  All the ones I've had off you are good quality.  Thanks for the upload!  ^_^"
,colorme,2010-10-16T08:54Z,"I think there might be a few minutes missing from the beginning. IMDB says it's 1:28 while this is 1:24 and it seems to begin right in the middle of a scene. No studio logos or opening credits, not even an establishing shot, just stuff happening. It's disconcerting. Anyone know about this?"
,indiaman,2011-03-04T05:34Z,"Thanks for this wonderful movie.
A 9/10
V 9/10"
