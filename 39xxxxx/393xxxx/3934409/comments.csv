Some seeding would be nice"
,~Green~Fire~,2007-12-15T17:44Z,"Tell that to them whom not seeding after they
downloaded it.
I've been seeding it all day on full...and if people
keep not seeding it after downloading....well I'll
seed a bit tomorrow as well but after that if no one
seed it it die (sorry but I'm doing the best I can)"
,~Green~Fire~,2007-12-15T21:31Z,ThanX a lot to the seeders.....You rock guys & girls.
,~Green~Fire~,2007-12-18T19:16Z,"Just let it run to at least 1:1 Ratio
Don't delete the Torrent direct after downloading it
and just run it for the person after you to get it
down too....But if your connection is really bad
then don't care about the 1:1 Ratio but seed it for
as long as you can..
That is all you need to do.

Cheers."
,~Green~Fire~,2007-12-21T20:53Z,Read the NFO File~
,~Green~Fire~,2008-01-12T00:45Z,"Do it feel good to tell lies?
and how is it to work and get money for saying this
lies here....Plus do you not think that people know
what is good shit or not....You only make yourself
the stupid ass by making a post like that...and you
do not even share shit either...ha ha ha stupid."
,slippiefist,2008-01-13T05:16Z,JCGROSS is a fucking idiot who doesn't know how to join a multi-part .rar.
,~Green~Fire~,2008-01-14T01:44Z,"JCGROSS

The village Idiot ~lol~ Yea I should have seen that
One who not know how to use WinRar or how to 
open an IFO....ha ha ha..

And ThanX Slippiefist for stating that out.
People like JCGROSS should not use Torrents
when they not know of the standard ways of
files.....-lol-"
,slippiefist,2008-01-15T03:44Z,"JCGROSS:

I lol'd at the Internet Tough Guy act. Very impressive. Maybe you should stick to LimeWire since you're too stupid to use torrents. And maybe you should stick to playing football and watching wrestling since you're obviously too HARD FUCKING CORE for the Internet.

ty, now GTFO my Internet plx."
,~Green~Fire~,2008-01-17T02:37Z,"JCCROSS GO Away!
We all know you are the fool already.

Sorry but this place are not for Idiots like you
and I wish I could block your ASS or kick you
from Pirate Bay..because you are but an little
shit that have nothing better to do than bug 
other people that try to enjoy Themselves in
a friendly way....I'm not gay but that don't give
you the right to Jump on a group of people like

First of all, you were wrong, it's not ""a bunch of rar files with no software in them"", it's a multi-part .rar with a full working Cyberlink Suite in it. So you're disparaging the uploader and you've no idea what you're talking about. You and assholes like you fuck up every u/l by acting like there's something wrong with it when it's just you're own stupidity. You encourage others not to dowlnload and you all the hard work the uploader put into this torrent goes to waste. And people pass on a working torrent and end up with crap. Uploaders don't have to dumb down their torrents and make everything a text serial because idiots like you have no computer skills or common sense. The torrent is not a waste of time, it works well. It's 1/3 of a GB, I think a split .rar is appropriate in this case.

Also, you're not a fucking tough guy, and you're veteran status doesn't impress me. It just means you're a fucking sheep and you killed women and children for a living. Blow me. Anybody can get in the US military, I've had to beat the recruiters off with a stick since 2001. So, yeah, go fuck your mother.

Everybody download this torrent it works fine. And seed you fucking jackoffs.

Will seed until Feb. 1st, then I'll have to clear a spot for more pr0n."
,slippiefist,2008-01-17T05:07Z,"Oh and, unlike the uploader, if you speak anymore here I will reply. I love to argue, it's my hobby. Say something you cunt."
,~Green~Fire~,2008-01-19T01:10Z,"slippiefist
I think I'll let you speak for me in the future.

ThanX Mate.

,QBMan,2008-02-03T22:13Z,There seems to be some real communication breakdown here. To JCGROSS it would seem as though the RAR files contained nothing because no one took the trouble to explain that this is infact a PowerISO file and should be burnt to CD from the PowerISO software. I got my verison from the official website and found a serial number on Piratebay :-) Peace People please..
,QBMan,2008-02-03T22:18Z,"Forgot to say this is awesome, better than I expected, see I do have PowerISO lol.."
,~Green~Fire~,2008-02-07T01:10Z,"Enjoy it.
Am using it myself as it have many little good things
of use for my work.
Would use AnyDVD too though to make it even
more great."
,~Green~Fire~,2008-02-13T23:33Z,"Hi there -TSELLC
Not having that version
But a tip....If you go to
http://www.darksiderg.com/
and ask a nice friend of mine there ""Mazuki"" he
might have it for you.

And thanX."
,~Green~Fire~,2008-02-16T15:31Z,No Problem.
,civiceyes,2008-08-24T23:22Z,"Thanks for the upload ~Green~Fire~
