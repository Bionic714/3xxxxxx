,rudeshark,2007-12-12T09:44Z,"Well, at least there is one thing good about private trackers.

No ""Joeys"" allowed!!!

Let's just hope Demonoid returns!"
,the_haole,2007-12-13T02:15Z,"Don't bother, just tried and the keys here don't work..."
,tofastagain54,2007-12-16T21:42Z,If you use this key with the old 6. you can use this key but not with 7.
,bentrader,2007-12-16T22:23Z,"why bother with this KAV, the NOD32 is way way better AV software. And there is work fix for latest V3.

,-Fredrik-,2007-12-21T01:22Z,"Kaspersky has blacklisted most of the shared keys every year around december-->christmas. This is nothing new. The reason for that is that most people got more money than usual to deal with, and so many get tired of looking up and testing blacklisted keys, that they simply buy a legal license. + it`s a nice christmas gift, sin`t it...?
As i said this is nothing new, and u don`t have to be Einstein to figure it out ur self

Do as i do every year.., download trial key now, use it to it`s out of date some time in january, then u can download working keys again from torrent`s or whatever u use"
,Crynsos,2008-01-15T22:03Z,"Well... I just used the first one in the package (with KIS v6) and it worked... the key's only active till 29.2.08, but at least 1 1/2 more months time to search for better keys...

Can't say anything about the other keys, can't try them now..."
