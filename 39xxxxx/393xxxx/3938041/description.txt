A collection of seven acoustic songs recorded by artist Joshua Croteau in the winter months of 2006, and the later summer days of 2007. All songs were written/recorded originally, with the influence of neil young, tell stories, the microphones, and vincent gallo.

Could be labelled as folk, folk-rock, noise-folk, folk-pop, acoustic-pop etc.

The songs are wholly about distant loves and the sea.
