,thickspeller,2010-08-25T03:04Z,"Please DON'T download this unless you want to spend a frustrating hour and a half. The subtitles are in such poor English that the film is rendered unwatchable unless you understand the German well enough. Very poor indeed, needs lots of work. Can anyone please suggest a different version with subtitles in English??? Thanks"
