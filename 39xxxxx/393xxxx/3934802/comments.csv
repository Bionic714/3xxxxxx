,gein_b,2008-02-15T21:19Z,"Language settings:
After off-line installation go to C:\Program Files\RACE 07 Offline\config.ini (which is created only after the first startup) and change the line 'LANGUAGEINDEX' to 0 (for english), 1 - German, 2 - French etc...
Good luck!"
,Cenilez,2008-03-03T22:08Z,you need an antisecurom program 2 load the game Ive tried it and it works Off line only greetz Cenilez
,Danusch,2008-04-05T21:40Z,The game works! But I can't change language. I can't find config.ini only config and it's in russian or something. Does anyone have an idea of what I'am doing wrong?
,shunthut43,2008-04-19T22:11Z,"might be a bit late to tell you this Danusch, but the config.ini was not created in the /program files/race 07 folder.

mine went it to my documents/race 07."
,denny927,2008-09-28T04:28Z,"all works fine...
for lenguages:install game(in russians obvious, a little bit complicated but not impossible lol), launch game with crack, in the first menu screen quit game and search on the root directory of race 07 the config.ini, then open it with a notepad and in the end of the list change the line LANGUAGEINDEX=x where x is a number of you prefered language.my language is italian so the number is 3....

i surprise wich other guys dont find the config.ini....is all boring simple...nice upload!!
100% works fine.sorry for my bad english;)"
