To find out wether these works on your phone or not, just friggin' download it and try it out for yourselfs, you lazy bastards."
,KingCrizzo,2010-02-01T02:31Z,"Thanks for the effort, but these are 240x320, NOT 320x240.  There is a difference.  I could rotate them all, but then they would be sideways on my phone."
