Nice audiophile sampler of great classic rock tunes from the 1970's. Mastered by Steve Hoffman from the original first generation master tapes in 1992. You've really never heard these songs sound this good. Gives you an idea of what Patti Smith's "Easter" or ELO's "Face the Music" would sound like if mastered by Steve. 

Ripped by EAC to FLAC. 

ENJOY! =)
