If anyone is downloading this just because it says george carlin and richard pryor dont bother but if you want to see a good movie from the 70s then check this shit out "

For some reason they cut out a whole side plot featuring his character and wife who ran the hotdog stand next to the car wash. It added depth to the film. Saw it on TV once, but every copy of the film I've seen for sale has that part removed... too bad."
