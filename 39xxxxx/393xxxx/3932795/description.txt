Re-post.


SCSI-9 is an extremely well established and highly respected name already.  The "Fear Of Flying" label is a new outfit based here in the UK which sprung up sometime in the fall of 2006.  They really caught my attention first with the release of Pawas' "Playtex EP" which contained a remix by our well reputed and esteemed friend, Daso.  Of course, I've kept my eye on the label ever since.

And then this title came along and totally drenched me in desire.


ALL versions are outstanding, but I've been spending an awful amount of time with the Pawas remix in particular, which sports a looooovely bit of tech bounce whilst maintaining the well crafted elements and theme in general of the excellent Original.

I am sure that many of you will heartily agree with me when I say that the Luna City Express remix is utterly smooth and sexy.



Enjoy and please seed.
