Don't you think a Trojan is considered a Trojan?? Exactly!!!

I'm not saying it clean because its probably not..But if you want to download Trojans to hack then expect it to come up as a Trojan"
,allexx_909,2008-11-18T00:35Z,are you guys stupid? OFC it includes viruses IT'S FOR FUCK SAKE a hacking toolkit. As long as you don't unpack the viruses then why worry?
,brangers,2009-12-15T01:07Z,"OK for the people that are SHOCKED to find VIRUSES AND TROJANS, click your browsers back button and... LEAVE!

If you want to hack someone, you need to have the trojans/viruses at hand to send, so OBVIOUSLY there is viruses in the pack!

Is that simple enough?"
