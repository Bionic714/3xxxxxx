,jersson,2007-12-15T16:46Z,I want a serial for Diskeeper 2008. Is this included in these serials ?
,micarone,2007-12-15T21:39Z,"Unfortunately it's not included. :(
But as far as I've searched around I didn't find it from the serial sites neither.
Maybe there's just not serial avalaible for Diskeeper 2008 yet and maybe it'll comes around in some point. You just must wait patiently."

,micarone,2007-12-19T17:23Z,Toyz : That's a pity. :( I've been running it under WinXP Pro so I really don't know about other platforms like Vista or even Win98 (if anyone is still using such a platform).
