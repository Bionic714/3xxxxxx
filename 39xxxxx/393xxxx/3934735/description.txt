1. Run Serials 2005
2. Choose FILE -> IMPORT UPDATE -> SERIALS 2005 UPDATE.
3. Choose the first file with file extension ".s2k5" (in this case 060107.s2k5) and      
   wait until the program has updated your database with it. (Number 060107 means
   the date when this particular update was released.)
4. Repeat this with other ".s2k5"-files and remember to do it from the oldest date
   into the most recent one.
5. ENJOY!
