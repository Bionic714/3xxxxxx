Note this is only the map. Download the Route66 Mobile7 v7.3.545 separately and sign it. GOOGLE is your friend :-)

Route66 Map for Nokia. Tested on N95 works perfectly with Route66 Mobile7 v7.3.545 and latest N95 Firmware as of writing 20.0.015 (To check firmware version type *#0000# on your mobile). If you cannot update the firmware using nokias firmware update tool, use this method.

After installing Route66 Mobile7 v7.3.545, extract Route66 2007 Map Britain nokia.7z to system/apps/route66/maps/ and you should be good to go.

Map highly compressed so should be a fast download.

NB: Signing a nokia application is a pain in the ass. Be persistant and google a lot. Also you cannot sign using web mail IDs.
