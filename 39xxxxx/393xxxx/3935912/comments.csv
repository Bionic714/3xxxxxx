,zsubrowka,2010-08-23T18:45Z,"26871237122 bytes and you shrinked the original DVD dimensions from 720 x 576 pixels MPEG2 Full-D1.

You are a complete moron.

Tényleg baromarcú vagy, ha csak erre voltál képes.

Szaros magyar informatikus pöcsarc."
,spudlick,2010-08-23T22:51Z,"A complete moron who allowed you to get an awesome tv show for free... yeah, what a jerk! Let's hurl insults at the guy who was nice enough to do that!!!"
,zsubrowka,2010-08-24T09:20Z,"spudlick: maybe you have a 14"" CRT monitor and for you it is OK like that.

An example: what  toozok did is like a Bugatti Veyron, on 3 wheels.

28GB - shrinked size --> unacceptable

BTW, the best version is:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5454356/Twin_Peaks_-_Definitive_Gold_Box_Edition

I checked it myself and the PQ is 10/10 on that version."
