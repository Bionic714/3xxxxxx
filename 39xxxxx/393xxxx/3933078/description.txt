Place the "Eidos Interactive" folder into your "program files" folder...
find the "Hitman2" icon...
right click the icon, goto send, and click "to desktop(create shortcut)" option.....
that way all you have to do to play is click the shortcut icon on your desktop.

I hope this solves some of the issues some of you have been dealing with.
