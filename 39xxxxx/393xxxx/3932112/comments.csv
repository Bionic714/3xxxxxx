,Tobotron,2007-12-13T13:10Z,Txt file is named incorrectly but film is as listed...enjoy!
,ezboard,2007-12-13T18:34Z,"...mkv... why not a normal AVI or MPEG or something format?
just wondering, thanks for the torrent!"
,Tobotron,2007-12-13T18:42Z,MKV is an opensource container and much better for high resolution images...HD films...gives an otherwise smaller filesize than an avi also! Pretty much playable by all software VLC/Miro/CCCP codec pack etc
,Fellup,2007-12-26T23:07Z,"I get no sound of them speaking, why?"
,_Wintermute_,2007-12-29T12:08Z,"mkv doesn't give smaller files ;-)

It's a container-file, hence it contains video, audio and other components.

.mkv-files are to prefer for a number of reasons: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mkv"
,garfield1974,2008-01-26T13:10Z,"Source is HDTV... Unless the HD tv-station has access to the original print, and has gone through the process of re-capturng the entire movie a sHD, this would just be an upscaled version og the normal DVD. A good upscaler perheps, but not something my PS3 couldn't do...

Or how does the HDTV-station come about their HD-material??"
,tinuviel949,2008-02-11T23:52Z,"watching on VLC is fine but when ripping, SERIOUS sound sync issues-like 2 sec delay."
,always_there,2008-02-14T07:19Z,"Umm... garfield... I think you're overlooking the fact that this movie was shot in HD. Not film. 

That being said, I don't think LucasFilm has released any sort of HD copy of any Star Wars movie yet... so I too am interested to know where they got this from."

I was about a frame out (couldn't get it any more accurate, sorry)

It looks upscaled to me."
,Col150,2008-04-08T23:06Z,"Pic is great but as far as I can see the sound is only 2 channel not 5.1
this is strange as 384kps is a normal 5.1 Dolby digital bitrate.

Is anyone actaully getting proper Dolby Digital 5.1 sound from this file not a 2 channel downmix like I am?"
,dennis101ca,2008-04-18T21:23Z,how do i get it to burn 5.1 says only 2 channel i am using convertxto dvd
,dennis101ca,2008-04-18T22:41Z,hey just converted and burnt with dvd shrink ....said it was 2 channelbut on my amp its 5.1
,piiider,2008-04-27T17:20Z,nice! 
,TheCool34,2008-04-30T23:46Z,Does any one know if u watch 3 and when it ends 4 stars from where 3 left off?
,xiIix,2008-05-23T09:29Z,Durrrrr!!
,jojje29,2008-06-11T23:59Z,this is fkking great stuff for my popcorn A-100. thanx mate. keep the single mkv-file torrents coming.  Hate all bitches putting up one thousand rar-files .. crawl out of you stone age caves and get with the program... ahhhh... single mkv torrents is the way of the future... 
,TeesterX,2008-08-03T21:05Z,I second that Jojje. Nice one Tobotron
,kingdom1,2008-11-14T14:02Z,"Not enough GBs for true HD - my BR's average > 15 GBs for a HD film.
Probably upscaled....on my PS3 the DVDs rock upscaled  though.
I'll buy these from Lucas when the time comes, but bless you rippers anyway.
But it ain't true HD."
,MrFingers,2008-11-25T23:08Z,badly compressed
,suck_this,2009-03-25T20:17Z,"use common sense 4.37 GB would not even be DVD quality I dont care how its encoded. I just downloaded and played Transformers on my 47"" LCD HDTV. It was supposed to be 720p x264. It was kind of grainy and that was a 8 GB file! If you have a smaller TV, OF COURSE its going to look better. VLC is garbage, I hear nothing but complaints about it. Download the new k-lite codec pack it has the newest Media Player Classic and that bitch plays everything except for Quick and Realtime plus it has TONS of cool features PLUS you get every codec you could ever need for WMP just in case. If you have a PS3 download ""PS3 Media Server"" it streams every kind of video file to your PS3 as it transcodes. No conversion necessary!"
,themistake,2009-08-14T18:15Z,"you should consider the codecs used to compress. DVD uses MPEG2 format. Mpeg4 is much better than MPEG2. x264 gives twice the compression with the same quality as Mpeg4. It is common sense. You can get a near DVD quality with around 400MB on x264. Surely 720p looks dull on your screen as it is best viewed on 42"" or lesser screen sizes. And I had also downloaded the 8GB transformer It was not good. The 4.37GB Russian copy was way better than that."
,spankbot,2009-10-23T00:41Z,"The only important question about this torrent:
Does Han shoot first is this one?"
,avian4518,2010-03-03T09:09Z,hehehehe im now going to take this and run it through adobe master sc4
,medwardl,2010-08-17T23:04Z,If your unable to hear the sound I'm betting that you are using 2 speakers and your player is set to 5 speakers I had the same problem once before. If your using vlc right click the video while playing go to audio then its either audio channels or audio device.
,usr098,2011-08-08T22:37Z,"Perfect, thanks."
