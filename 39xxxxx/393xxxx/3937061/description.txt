You can get this movie from other torrents, and in higher quality. However this is pretty decent quality, and was found on the Internet Archive.  If you don`t want to take up a full 4GB of hard disk space this torrent will do just fine.

The Power of Nightmares is a documentary that describes how, around the same time, two ways of thinking about the world formed, one radical islam, in the way of Sayyed Qutb, the other, strauss\\\' neoconervativism.  It includes references to 9/11, and other important historical events.  The film attempts to portray the two ideologies as competing interests, that are very similar in aim, history, and in substance.

It\\\'s not perfect, however, and there are gaping holes in it\\\'s interpretation of history.  Corporations, are not mentioned(you can confirm this). 

But it\\\'s a good watch nonetheless, especially if you\\\'re willing to read those above 3 links afterwards.(there is 3, where`s the 3rd one?  Gah! I give up, firefox has crashed, find it yourself.  Keyword; medialens, power of nightmares).
