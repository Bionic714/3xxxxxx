          Unbeknownst to most Nirvana fans, drummer David
          Grohl was also a singer/guitarist/songwriter who
          wrote numerous songs on his own during his tenure
          with the band. After Kurt Cobain's death in 1994,
          Grohl decided to head out on his own and formed
          the Foo Fighters, where he assumed frontman
          duties. Virtually an instant success, the Foos
          reflected Grohl's former band's melodic-punk-pop,
          though with a somewhat lighter attitude.
