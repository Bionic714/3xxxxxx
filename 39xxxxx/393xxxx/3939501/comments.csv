,Sonic5688,2007-12-19T12:00Z,I'm taking requests for other multidisc games as well. Just post your request as a comment.
,Galagher,2007-12-19T19:41Z,"Please post MGS, (U) version. ^_^"
,Sonic5688,2007-12-20T00:24Z,"I already did, please check my other torrents. Enjoy!"
,Sonic5688,2007-12-20T01:36Z,I'd like to apologize to those that downloaded my Chrono Cross for PSP torrent. The game locks up and makes it unplayable. I've tried fixing it by using a lower compression level but it still locks up.
,MARC001,2007-12-23T04:28Z,hey sonic..where do i D/L..firmware 3.71 m33-4..sorry im new at this..:(:(:(....may i request a game..fear effect1 or 2..its on PS1..:)..
,Sonic5688,2007-12-23T06:03Z,"MARC001: You can find all your psp updates over at www.psp-hacks.com. Also, I'll convert one or both of those if either of them are multi disc. I'm only doing multi disc conversions right now, so if either of them are, I'll have them up by next weekend (it'd be a lot sooner, but christmas is here...)"
,MARC001,2007-12-23T06:35Z,yo sonic..if i have 3.80..do i have to downgrade..
,Sonic5688,2007-12-23T06:38Z,"Yes, and your only option is Pandora which requires a spare battery and an already hacked phat psp (ask your friends if you can borrow theirs)"
,MARC001,2007-12-23T06:42Z,"a battery i can get,,,not sure about the hacked psp.."

,Sonic5688,2007-12-23T23:05Z,"Don't mention it, glad I could help."
,lonfar,2008-01-18T02:27Z,Could you please upload Parasite eve 2 slps 00025 thanks you for PE 1
,Sonic5688,2008-01-26T19:29Z,"lonfar, Parasite Eve 2 does not work on the PSP as of 3.71. 3.80 may be a different story, but the rip I did for PE2 didn't work no matter what settings I tried so I didn't upload. If there are any rippers out there interested in helping me, please let me know in a comment. I need people to rip or convert games, or both. Thanks!"
,Sonic5688,2008-01-26T19:30Z,"P.S.

I can teach you the rip/convert procedure."
