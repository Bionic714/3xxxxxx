There's about 50 leechers per download x 8 downloads doesn't give a lot out.

Just want to help share these as quick as possible. "

,barabusignasius,2007-12-24T20:05Z,"Its not that no one is seeding its that no one has completed the download yet.   Danvart is seeding like ten torrents at once.  Big ups to him for keeping the seeds going but I wish he would pay attention to the comments and I hope he would at least drop the torrents that have beeen picked up by other seeders.  Danvart if your listening.  Drop the ones that are done!!!!!  Pause the others except for one!!!!!!!  Ive got 100 MB left on the torrent and at this rate it will take a week!!!!!  People will pick up the seeds once they have it downloaded.  If you stopped and did one at a time you would be done seeding in a few hours.  At this rate you will be seeding for a month.   Seriously man, be pro active and use your noggin."

This is Part 2 of Digital Tutors Character Rigging,

not the original Digital Tutors Character Rigging.

The torrent is named wrong."
