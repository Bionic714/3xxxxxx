ational drug manufacture available.
Well, hardly. I haven't read the entire book yet, and while it's informative, much of it is just ridiculous.
While it's definitely worth dl'ing the 2MB, i wouldn't spend anything above 15ct for it.

However, thx for the upload.
PS: If anybody else is wondering what ""making stuff"" is, it refers do the almost-kinda-usable synthesis of recreational drugs."
