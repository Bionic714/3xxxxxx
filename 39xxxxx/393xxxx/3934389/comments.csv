,viramP,2007-12-22T16:00Z,"it is shame nobody has been able to crack Norton internet security 2008 , none of the cracks of the software in pirate bay is working all end up to 15 days trail version.

Then is it that Norton internet security 2008 is a real good software, as compared to this Norton 360 good working cracks are avialble here.

Norton internet security 2008 does not have pop up and adware blocker where as Norton360 has this function, but Norton internet security 2008 has other features like on demand scan and seems to work faster .

common up crackers gives us the real deal not internet trail versions"
,knightgangsta,2007-12-22T20:44Z,"it works but i have

,newt182,2008-01-02T19:50Z,does what ThRiLl_SeAkEr said work? is it still working for you ThRiLl_SeAkEr?
,brianxxx,2008-01-23T23:59Z,"AGAIN people - for once in your greedy fucking lives...pay for a program. Especially SECURITY. If the security product is compromised in a way undetectable (which is a daily occurrence these days!!!) how will you know your machine is not a drone or compromised??? For the SALE price of about $50 Symantec gives you 3 licenses. THREE!!! So basically, you are getting top notch (my opinion and many other research labs' opinion) product for a measly $17 per PC!!!! Go 50/50 with a friend or family member AND SHARE THE COST.  "
,depsi,2008-01-30T06:04Z,Thanks for now its working and its my first day. Raven is really gr8

,cambruss,2008-03-21T12:54Z,Thanks Raven & superleeds28.This is my 20th day after installing nis 2008.I had nis 2007 before  with 11 years subscription.Its all working for me. I just had to disable symantec core LC service before the change of CLTVault.dll from nis 2007.I run LU with no issues.:-).
,cambruss,2008-03-21T12:58Z,Guys incase the problem arises set the date to one month later and copy the new CLTVault.dll of nis 2008 back and run LU.Then boot the computer in safe mode and once again copy the old CLTvault.dll of nis 2007 back.This time it will never give u any error.Enjoy..........
,freeuser12,2008-04-13T05:28Z,"Dont download those fake bullshit patches, I got the working patch-fix, Now you can have NIS 2008 activated up to 11yrs (4015 days) BIG thanx to dazza2963
