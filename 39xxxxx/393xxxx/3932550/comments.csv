,TheTrekhippy,2010-02-22T23:43Z,I notice in the bestiary there are inaccuracies as well as one missing Flan monster.  ANyone else notice anything like that?  stoopid Bradygames
,Quad-K,2010-03-17T09:03Z,"Thanks heaps, been looking for a while. Great quality, although the OCR tends to make mistakes interpreting words. But otherwise, great upload, thanks a lot WestenFeldt.

PS. I don't believe the guide is for the 2nd international version ( or which ever has dark aeons) as i read nothing about dark aeons in it. "
