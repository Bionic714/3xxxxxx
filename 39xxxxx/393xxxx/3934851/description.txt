          The U.K. music scene is notorious for launching
          previously unknown bands to the heights of stardom
          on word-of-mouth gossip and music-press hype
          alone. Arctic Monkeys took that phenomenon to an
          entirely new level when they sold 110,000 copies
          of their 2005 debut LP, WHATEVER PEOPLE SAY I AM,
          THAT'S WHAT I'M NOT, in the first two days of its
          release. An undeniably accessible (and bankable)
          mix of Brit Pop, U.K. punk, and hip-hop swagger
          has led fans and critics to dub them the next
          Oasis.
