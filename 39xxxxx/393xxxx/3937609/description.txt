Re-post.



For those who may have missed this essential release last time round on my release schedule before Demonoid went down, here is the excellent mashup of Pryda's "Nile" and The Police's "Message In A Bottle".


Re-posts and reconstruction of my release schedule will be complete by new year, from which time, only the very latest releases covering the entire spectrum of house and techno will be posted.

Don't forget to check for any other Pryda titles you may be missing on the schedule.



Enjoy and please seed.
