DONOVAN'S REEF - 1963

  John Wayne, Lee Marvin and Jack Warden play World War II buddies who have 

made the French Polynesian island of Haleakaloha their post-war paradise. 

Local headquarters is Donovan's Reef, Wayne's rough-and-tumble watering 

hole where bragging, brawling, and full-blown misbehavior are the order of 

the day. But destined to create more turmoil is the sudden arrival of 

Elizabeth Allen, a straight-laced Boston blue blood. She's hoping to locate 

her long-estranged father (Jack Warden), affirm that he is not of good 

character, and then assume control of the family's shipping business back 

in the States.
