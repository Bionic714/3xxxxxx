,paukke,2008-03-29T00:56Z,"thanks for this dude :) I actually have a real retail of this, which came with my old SB live! value back in the day, but I can't find it anywhere :("
,paukke,2008-03-29T00:58Z,"BTW, If you guys want to play this with a little bit better graphics, get the Old Skool mod for Unreal Tournament. On that mods homepage, there are instructions on how to copy the files from Unreal to Unreal Tournaments folders, and then play the game through it."

,SolitaryOne,2008-04-03T19:44Z,most people who download this torrent wont be too concerned with graphics. most people would download this for more nostalgic reasons then anything :P

,caseyfw,2009-08-26T22:46Z,"@hybridsoldier

Actually, past v2.26b any releases are unofficial updates from an independent modding community - which is not to say they aren't worth doing, just that they weren't ever supported by relic."

,Gashimahiron,2011-02-02T08:38Z,"whoops!

,ghostwonder,2012-06-04T18:29Z,Great torrent a must have for classic gamin. :>
,malcumsquirt,2012-07-30T15:16Z,"Your patch is useless rubbish. When I attempt to install it, I get an error message. Apparently this version of Unreal is too old to be patched. Also, the damned thing refused to run correctly. It won't let me use hardware rendering, and when I use software rendering it lags every time I fire my gun. Plus, when in software rendering mode the graphics quality is severely reduced. Sometimes it doesn't allow me to run it in full screen mode, only windowed. I just keep getting one error after another. Oh yeah, and it has a tendency to crash if I attempt to change settings. "
