All you need to do is edit the file Mk4.reg
and add WOW6232Node\ after Software
then save it and run then double click on it to merge it into the registry.

Here are the contents of my file

,ReenSham,2012-06-25T22:25Z,"why people are confusing with alot of those long procedures of entering the directory. 
Al u have to do is install it, then double click one of the icons which named ""MK4 Registration Entries""..its only 1 kb file.. double click it it will ask u , click yes! and ur registry is completed. Click the game icon again , it will run. it is as simple as that. Enjoy! 
It worked for me with XP. I dont know about Windows7 or Vista. "
