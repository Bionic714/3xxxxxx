,satnapar,2008-08-09T12:08Z,"for those who can't install anything but livetype. first find and download a ""Final Cut Uninstaller"". it can be easily found on the web. then you are ready to continue. By the way I can't run LiveType. When i try to open it, it show the logo and after that quit. I tried to re-install it and i have the same problem. even when i install the Content DVDs the result is the same: double-click, logo, and nothing...."

,Ptahnut,2009-05-05T01:55Z,"Hey People. Yes I am giving this to anyone that wants it. My company purchased 3 copies and I brought one at the company discount price. So if you really want it, here is want you will need to do.

First email me and let me know and then you will have to send my a pack of DVD +R DL disk so that I can get you a backup copy of the program. Once you email me, I will get you the address where to send the disk. Do not contact me if you are not serious. This is not a scam, just a tech who believe in sharing.


Let keep sharing alive and Greedy person broke.
