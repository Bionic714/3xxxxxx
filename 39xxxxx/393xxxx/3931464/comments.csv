I will try to seed every day between 17.00 and 23.00 UK time. We'll get there eventually, please keep the paysite torrents seeding as long as possible, thanks."
,toboinc567,2007-12-20T02:15Z,WTF am i doing wrong here i downloaded this file and afther putting it all in the downloads in the sims 2 download folder but half of them dont work all thios shit uslees help me
,SilverArrows,2007-12-24T18:05Z,"You need to extract everything to the downloads folder ie My Documents > EA Games > the sims 2 > Downloads. Please check on the S2S site at TSR, you may need certain EPs for some files to work. (custom content made with the bodyshop that shipped with the Pets EP wont work if you don't have Pets). Have you installed the CEP? If not, do that first. If it's still not showing up then you might have too many files in your downloads folder. Full instructions are on my torrent page. If you've followed all the steps and it still doesnt work you'll have to contact Sims2Sisters, I can't provide support for their work."
,l67861652,2008-01-06T19:08Z,I think some meshes are missing. Have the same problem as you toboin. And it's acctually not very nice clothes there is much better! But nice with thesimsresource files! :D
,SilverArrows,2008-01-10T22:23Z,"I did include all the meshes that are available at PMBD. The S2S site: 
thesimsresource.com/artists/sims2sisters/

If 3rd-party meshes are needed then it should be listed there where to get them from. Either that or you don't have the required expansion packs installed."
,SilverArrows,2008-01-10T22:27Z,"Just checked, yes some of them do require meshes by other artists at TSR. All the pay meshes should be available at pmbd, get them ici:
