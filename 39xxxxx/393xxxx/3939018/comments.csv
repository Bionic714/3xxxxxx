,kiwibirdz,2011-01-26T03:46Z,anyone else see the Irony that we're torrenting God's Word?
,Real_Maxor,2011-03-01T18:38Z,"In the bible it is said that gods word is to be freely given, and this is what we are doing. Albeit, I'm being a little facetious in that it's still a production that cost money to make, and animate. I however thank this uploader since he will surely burn in hell for this... Irony 2 , world..... ehh you get it."
