This is a very engaging film which can be enjoyed by by climbers and non climbers, mainstream and experimental film fans alike... great score and even greater cinematography..."

,abraxas69,2008-03-11T16:42Z,"I have seeded it again..... you rare film hunters should use eMule, it is better than torrent"
,Namtillaku,2008-03-11T20:06Z,"Thanks for the tip about eMule, I'll check it out.  Also, thanks for seeding."
