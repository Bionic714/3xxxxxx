The BBC produced this fascinating documentary about Argentine tango at La Confiteria Ideal in Buenos Aires, a grand dance hall still resplendent in its faded glory, and the site of numerous films over the years.  The last few minutes of the program are missing from this file, but this does not detract from a delightful program.
