,djtdon,2007-12-15T18:23Z,"wtf i just downloaded minority report off you

and its really small =[ 700mb but really small so theres quite a loss of quility "
,Xendor69,2007-12-23T20:59Z,"djtdon - Xvid and DivX are SUPPOSED to be small so that (a) they download fast, and (b) they fit on a CD (rather than a DVD5/DVD9). If you want better quality then you should perhaps be looking for DVD5/DVD9 downloads - and then put up with downloads which take six times as long (or more)!

Hint... small files = loss of quality, large files = best quality. Your choice."
,Blangle,2008-02-04T16:38Z,"hey Xendor69, i'm confused, can you please break all that down again but make it simpler, I'm not quite following what you're trying to say."
,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-02-08T10:04Z,You're Funny.
,kingsofa,2008-02-17T03:21Z,you will hardly notice the quality gained from watching a dvd vs an Xvid or DivX anyways.  Unless it is HD the quality loss is minor compared to the size of the file you are downloading
,bigdaddya1969,2008-02-18T06:04Z,"hey zender69 how the hell you think you are going to put a 700mb avi or divx on a single cd
yeah if you change to kvcd format but how else
that is a new one to me."
,pollop1,2008-02-24T17:33Z,"hey bigdaddya1969   are just pretending to be stupid have you never heard of divx player you stick a cd in burn, pop it into your divx compatible dvd player most new dvd players are and there you go no kvcd needed "
