A really good sounding recording from last weekend's gig.  Here are the original notes:

Manic Street Preachers
Toothpaste N' Burn

NIA, Birmingham
8 December 2007


Lineage: Sony ECN-719 mic > Edirol R-09 > Audition (cuts, normalising, adjusting balance & a little frequency adjusting to bring out the vocals - see below) >FLAC level 5

Position: Block 7 row Q seated about three yards from the mixing desk.

The NIA is one of the predominant West Midlands venues in the UK but I've always thought that the sound is a bit muggy on the mid ranges. This wasn't really helped by James Dean Bradfield's bout of flu. Therefore using Sonic Maximiser I've tried to pull the vocals out a little bit.

The title "Toothpaste N' Burn" is a reference to Nicky Wire's pain from forgetting his foundation and using toothpaste instead. What a tw@t! ;-)

Other interesting bits: a part cover of "She Sells Sanctuary" by The Cult & about 20 seconds of Ozzy Osborne's "Crazy Train" riff in homage to Birmingham.
