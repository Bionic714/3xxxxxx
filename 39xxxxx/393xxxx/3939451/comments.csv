,Cucamonga,2008-01-12T17:30Z,"Sure! But I live in Brazil and I need wait for the DVDs for conversion. It will be released soon, I hope. "
,laheara,2008-01-13T22:35Z,"I see this is spoken in English, but are there substitles on the screen or do you have to turn them on?  I'm looking for clean screen so I can make fan music videos of them.  Thanks.  "
,Cucamonga,2008-01-19T13:51Z,"If you don't want the subtitles, move or delete the .SUB files."
,Cucamonga,2008-01-19T13:52Z,Sorry. Move or delete .SRT (not SUB) files.
,klawfeet,2008-02-17T21:15Z,"hi there im sorry about this but its just that i normally connect my hard drive to my tv then watch but with file it doesnt work, any ideas please?"
,Cucamonga,2008-02-23T00:10Z,"These files were codec with unusual codecs (X.264 for video and Vorbis for audio). It may be the cause. But you can use WinAVI 7.x to make conventional DVDs from these files. Don't use version 8.x because it has bugs.

Good luck."

,Varinia,2010-06-30T07:31Z,Excellent quality - thnx for the up
,rushbr,2010-09-26T20:26Z,"Hi, Cucamonga. Do you speak Portuguese? First of all, i apreciated your work. Your non-HD  torrents are the best i ever found, and i winder if you donÂ´t have the others seasons of Criminal Mind. This Torrent comes with DVD extras with PT-BR subtitles. ItÂ´s really rare. Please, continue with this excelent work. I will seed all your torrents for a very long time. We, brazilians, we need a uploader like you. Thank you very much.

And OGG plays very well on KMPLayer, which for me is the best free player out there. Totally customisable."
