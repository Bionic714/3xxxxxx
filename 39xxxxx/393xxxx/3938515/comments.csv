,spark449420,2008-08-30T04:25Z,This rar opens & shows an .exe file for download. I suggest you immediately delete .rar & torrent so that no one else is being sucked in by this. Most probably a trojan or similar.
,spark449420,2008-08-30T04:33Z,"Additional suggestion: watch for the identifer field By: FoxoF If you see that the torrent was uploaded by whomever this is, don't bother. As soon as I figure out how to get this uploader burned out of this site, I'll be doing it. In the meantime folks, be wary."
