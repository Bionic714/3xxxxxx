,tomtom660,2009-03-28T21:59Z,"I remember seeing them in Hartford a few days before this was recorded. VH was one a very few bands that could sell out shows in Hartford and New Haven in the same week. Given their proximity, most acts would not have tried to book shows in both. After having seen VH in New Haven on the 1984 tour, I was not expecting much. Boy was I wrong, Sammy added a lot more energy, and less ego, to the show. Thanks to srw, I can't wait to watch this. If only they could video tape the parking lot extravaganza Veterans Memorial was  known for."
