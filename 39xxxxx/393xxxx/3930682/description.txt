Hey all,
    Maybe I can get this one right. This is Van Halen Live Without A Net. The first big concert video with Sammy. It covers some GREAT tunes plus the ever so awesome solo by Eddie. It's in .avi format and I kept the sound at 192 mp3. 
  I usually upload at a different site but I wanted to do something good on TPB. 
I intend to do more. A previous upload of THE WHO didn't work for unknown reasons.
I'll get back to that one in the near future. But for now, I hope you enjoy this. 
                                                                         srw567
