Sceners AiR, a 0Day group bring us this rather strange, long winded release. Intermorphic liptik Lyric Generator is supposed to give you an advantage over other writers and poets in creating a master piece by putting your ideas into a finished song or poem or whatever. I tried it for a few seconds and it didn?t really work but that?s probably because i was messing about and not using it properly. Still its about a meg or so in size and doesn?t require an installation so it wont be pain to try out and then delete if necessary. So here it is, 1 archive, 1 keygen for reg (with some rather annoying repeating music), 1 silly program, have fun!

Description: If you want an extra advantage when it comes to creative writing then try liptikl. It is mainly aimed at helping to write lyrics or poetry, but you can use it as you want.
