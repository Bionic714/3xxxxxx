,original_jtb,2008-02-06T01:48Z,"Villvetta: When you download a torrent through a program such as bitcomet, you are in fact downloading from other users (leaching) and uploading to other users simultaneously.  When you finish your download instead of disconnecting your program such as Bitcomet, leave it on so that it may upload the content continously to others which is seeding.  That way everyone can enjoy the files, and keep in mind, that someone seeded for you which is how you were able to watch the movie so please return the favor to others.  Thanks!  "
,mxchampion,2008-02-07T12:56Z,this is the worst movie iÂ´ve ever seen in this genre. cheap movie.. but download and take a look at it yourself and see =)

,il duche,2008-03-08T02:23Z,"Seed is when you let the torrent get uploadet from you as well , so you are helping others to download the torrent to ;-)
