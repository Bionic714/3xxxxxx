Tried several players and no one could play it, MediaInfo could not get any codec or audio information from it, so it is probably not a media file at all."

,ClipperCigars,2012-01-14T21:07Z,"Of course it doesn't play, it's just a big empty null file. 

Makes me wonder what is up, because it's a trusted uploader, so I doubt it was deliberate."
