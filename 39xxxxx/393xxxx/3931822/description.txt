Description:

Since the Persian Gulf War, the term "New World Order" has become well known. 
However, there has never really been an explanation as to what the term meant, 
only that it represented a new spirit of cooperation among the nations of the 
world in order to further the cause of peace. And peace is good, so therefore 
the New World Order is good and should be accepted. Not so fast. Like the old 
saying, you can't tell a book by its cover, there is more here than meets the eye.

The term "New World Order" was actually first used many years ago. Adolf Hitler 
said: "National Socialism will use its own revolution for the establishing of a 
new world order." The Associated Press reported that on July 26, 1968, New York 
Governor Nelson Rockefeller said in a speech to the International Platform 
Association at the Sheraton Park Hotel in New York, that "as President he would 
work toward international creation of a New World Order."
