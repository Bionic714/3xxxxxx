*THIS IS NOT A REMASTER BUT THE ORIGINAL PARLOPHONE VINYL AS IT WAS MEANT TO SOUND*

Banged out in a hurry for the 1964 Christmas market, Beatles for Sale sometimes sounds it, loaded with ill-conceived covers and some of John Lennons most self-loathing lyrics. 

On the other hand, the people doing the banging-out were the Beatles, whose instincts for what worked musically were so strong that they could basically do no wrong--any record that has Babys in Black I Dont Want to Spoil the Party and the delectable Eight Days a Week on it is only minor in the most relative sense. And, though their voices had been frazzled a bit by constant touring, they revved them up for some joyous shouting, and indulged their fondness for American country in subtle, playful ways.
