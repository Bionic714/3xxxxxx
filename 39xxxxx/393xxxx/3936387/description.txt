RealAir Simulations SF.260 for FS2004

The SF-260 is the world's most successful modern screener and primary trainer.

Its flight characteristics and performance levels allow it to screen student pilot candidates while also effectively covering the entire primary training phase.

With the SF-260, student pilots can achieve the skill levels required for a smooth transition to higher performance basic trainers. This minimizes the costs incurred when student pilots are washed out later in the training process.

Some 27 different military customers have already bought 880 SF-260 in all variants. Recently the Italian Air Force ordered its fourth batch of thirty SF-260EA, with an avionics configuration tailored to its specifications. The aircraft is also a favourite of civil professional flying schools.

The SF-260 is a fully-aerobatic, two seater, side-by-side propeller-driven trainer, with additional third seat to expand its flexibility in non-aerobatic missions. It is available in both piston-engined and turboprop variants, respectively powered by a 260 hp Lycoming AEIO-540 (SF-260E) or a 350 shp Rolls-Royce/Allison Model 250 B-17D turboprop (SF-260TP).

The worldwide SF-260 fleet has accumulated over 1,800,000 flight hours.
