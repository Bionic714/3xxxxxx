Unless it's because of of your sound quality.
If you haven't improved it since I last spoke to you.

Have you?

Who cares about a few more score fucking megabytes, mate? You would be my #1 ripper if it hadn't been for the sound fuckup. Good taste (more or less), great quality. Dedication.

As for myself - I'm a parasite. I get to comment, but I don't contribute shit, do I?

It all makes sense when you're drunk....."
