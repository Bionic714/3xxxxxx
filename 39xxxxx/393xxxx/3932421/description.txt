Charles de Lint is a Canadian fantasy author and Celtic folk musician. It is often said that, along with Terri Windling, he established the genre of mythic fiction which falls somewhere between fantasy literature, and mainstream fiction with a magical realist bent. This is debatable, as John Crowley preceded de Lint with the novel "Little, Big", which was published in 1981, and won the World Fantasy Award the following year for its blending of classical fantasy with modern culture. In any case, de Lint can certainly be credited with popularizing the emerging genre, which is also known as "urban myth" or "urban fantasy." De Lint's work has been called "fantasy for people who normally don't read fantasy."  (Quoted from Wikipedia)
