[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-12-13T03:05Z,I can't take credit for this Release. Not sure who the RG is. I was got it from a rapidshare download on a tip from a Piratefiles user and thought the quality was good enough to share. It is one of the best CAM's I've seen. The only problem with it is that the Spanish subtitles were cropped off leaving the AR slightly off.

,GoYanks,2008-01-11T17:54Z,"It is ridiculous that this movie got so much attention. Does no one see that this world is going down in flames. No one should download this movie. Plus the guy who wrote this says he is an athiest, well if athiest dont believe in Christ or the devil then why would he symbolize a child killing God at the end? He does believe and he is just a soul crying out for help. I am praying for all of the lost souls out there. Let God in! He loves you and wants you to enter his kingdom."
