Roy Chubby Brown - The Good, The Bad And The Fat B*stard 

DvD to Divx.

Synopsis :
For all his bad taste, Roy Chubby Brown is undeniably something of a phenomena. For over 20 years, he has built an extremely strong career solely on the basis of his live comedy shows and has done incredibly well at it. Early on, he marketed himself as the UK comedian who would use as much profanity as possible and make the most controversial, lewd, offensive and outrageous remarks. While that choice closed some doors, audiences loved his off colour, common man approach, and, as the legend goes, Chubby has only to post an announcement of an upcoming live performance and, through word of mouth, audiences come in droves.
