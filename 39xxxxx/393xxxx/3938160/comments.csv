Everyday I'm searching for any new upload for this compilation (have them all), and I appriciate you work :-)
Keep on Rockin' ;P
By the way, have you heard about two Norwegian brothers that have made a cd with only covers.
The band is called ""Brothers"" but don't know their names. Cd is called ""Two for the price of one"", and was released 1994. If u want me to rip it for your future compilation, send me a mail: brent-bice@hotmail.com (Sweden)."
