This is a collection of music by me (Sheep). It's not very good but that's kinda my thing. I play mostly acoustic, with a few techno type songs on my second album. This collection contains my first 2 CDs, a comp that I'm on, and an extra song I recorded for the same people who put me on the comp. It's a mixture of nerdy and comedy music, my influences come from folk, punk, ska, and other assorted genres. I don't ask for any money, not even donations, this is completely free music. You might like it, you might not but it's free so why not give it a listen? If you're interested check out my myspace page: http://myspace.com/anarchyshoe

Thanks and Enjoy!
