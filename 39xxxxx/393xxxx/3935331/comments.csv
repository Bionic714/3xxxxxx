,libertard,2007-12-16T06:52Z,Anyone successes with unrar password?
,libertard,2007-12-16T07:02Z,don't waste your sperms with this
,the_haole,2007-12-16T14:30Z,"This is a b/s file. I agree, don't waist your time. It doesn't work."
,urinology,2007-12-16T16:26Z,you r right. hillotata is a A-----. waste of time. such people should be banned from uploading
,etebari_sf,2007-12-16T20:10Z,"yall, it works I'm actually installing and launching the app right now.. It's the real Premier version..
The password is not the 1st with exclaimation point as the instructions say. so try the others after that.."
,chuckmouse,2007-12-16T23:26Z,It's a waste of time. Password does not wok.
,tuc2008,2007-12-17T02:48Z,pass:  you!
,baldtexan56,2007-12-17T19:41Z,"Tuc2008 had the right password, at least it works for me.

Pass:  run!"
,robertward7,2007-12-19T14:33Z,tuc2008 has the right password. hillotata is a stroker!
,c2nah,2007-12-20T02:30Z,Works fine password = you!
,Les_Springs,2007-12-20T03:08Z,"Uploader hillotata wants the Macy's free gift; that's the reason for the RAR password.  Not much to ask for for uploading the app, I think.  Give hillotata the credit and gift, instead of just taking hillotata's upload, pls.

I had a problem extracting the ISO, and used MagicISO to uncompress and CD-mount successfully.  Haven't installed yet...hope I don't have to get a keygen or activation code.  Will comment again if further info (SN, password, act code, etc) needed, to save others the work."
,Sunseeker908,2007-12-21T17:06Z,"Password ""you!"" worked for me but I couldn't mount the ISO with Daemon tools.  WinISO extracted the files and I was able to install it. Appears to be  the real deal.

Looks like hillotata has an agenda,  too bad he can't be a team player and distribute the torrent without strings attached."
,ricksickle,2007-12-22T03:52Z,"Yup, password of you! worked just fine.  Help em out with the free gift tho..."
,spacerog,2007-12-24T01:26Z,password: you!
,spacerog,2007-12-24T01:38Z,"yeah, the password works but what good is it when the ISO is not recognized. File is junk. Just a ploy to get a free gift. Lame."
,strizal,2008-01-01T07:21Z,"it works perfect....    ( you! )  type you! 
 just like that = you! 
thanks, keep seed it"
,Lamarilla,2008-01-01T13:24Z,Great!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
,Truvbay,2008-01-01T23:33Z,Total garbage. hillotata is an asshole for upping this. 
,talkingmonkey,2008-01-01T23:59Z,"garbage...
didn't mount with daemon tools"
,ricksickle,2008-01-03T05:17Z,"Password works, but does not mount with alcohol"
,trixdropd,2008-01-03T20:43Z,"This works fine. Use you! as the password and mount with poweriso. Daemon's tools don't work witht this.
Happy taxes peeps..."
,gaston888888,2008-01-04T07:27Z,I downloaded and used the password.... I mounted with NERO and so far so good..Thanks for the upload
,deathventure,2008-01-08T18:43Z,"Works fine, installed mounting with power iso. Rar password is            you!                     "
,evanbacolod,2008-01-11T09:16Z,"Password is you!
Domt bother going to the web url just type you! and extract."
,framitz,2008-01-12T17:19Z,"Fuck anyone that uploads passworded content.  There are plenty of other versions that work just fine available all over the place.

Fuck this dude."
,joem4810,2008-01-12T17:45Z,a waste of time.  it's a trial version. worthless
,traceadkins1234,2008-01-16T02:22Z,"It all Works fine, But you still have to pay $ 45 to E file Federal tax..............................."
,LuniLadi,2008-01-18T00:33Z,"Anyone have any problem downloading the state return? I just get a window where I can select the free state but no ""continue"" button to make it work. Thanks for the assist."
,traceadkins1234,2008-01-18T04:49Z,State down loaded fine for me...........
,LuniLadi,2008-01-18T15:49Z,Any suggestions on how I can get the state portion to work? I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling...even deleted the software registry key for this year's version. I extracted the files from the .iso image into the same directory and installed from there...could that be the problem? Can't figure it out and I'm going crazy. Thanks for any help/suggestions.
,specialt9,2008-01-20T22:11Z,"Thanks for posting the password deathventure

PASSWORD IS ""you!"""
,mikenytola,2008-02-05T07:36Z,Ok what the hell am I missing.  I extracted the files but they all seem to be mac OSX???
,mikenytola,2008-02-05T07:38Z,"Never mind, I'm an idiot"
,budser,2008-03-17T00:47Z,"SCAM WARNING:  Turbotax requires you to pay an additional $35.90 to e-file your federal and state returns.  RIPOFF.  Fortunately, it gives you the option of printing your return (to mail it in) for free."
,zorkenberry,2008-03-17T16:28Z,"It's crap that you can't use daemon tools to mount... only works with poweriso according to posts on previous page.  Too much bullshit, look elsewhere."
,zorkenberry,2008-03-17T19:07Z,"Was able to burn the iso, even though I couldn't mount it with daemon tools.  However, for less headache I recommend:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3949293/TurboTax_Premier_Home__amp__Business_2007
You still have to pay to e-file though, in any turbotax version."
,Les_Springs,2008-03-28T17:21Z,"Just got done with my 1040, and this download worked GREAT, including the free State return.  NOT a demo or limited trial, everything worked perfectly!
THANKS to uploader ""hillotata""."
,element5,2008-04-06T08:45Z,"Those wishing to thwart TurboTax'$ e-file charge, can file with TaxACT.  I filed my taxes and they only charge about $14 to e-file.  This is less than half of TurboTax'$ fee, so those wishing to file quickly can go this route.

Awesome upload by the way, however, I chose to file with TaxACT."
,kron4me,2008-04-07T17:42Z,Fuck anyone who uploads passworded bullshit torrents!
,Killeravocado,2008-04-16T00:45Z,"WoW, the people who said that this didn't work, it's garbage etc... etc... etc... This works, he just wanted some crappy macys giftcard, I mean kudos to him for thinking of something like that... Turbotax works for both mac and windows machine, so if you see mac files, that's the reason. FYI the password is ""you!"" (no quotes). Try to think before you complain, it's ignorant."
