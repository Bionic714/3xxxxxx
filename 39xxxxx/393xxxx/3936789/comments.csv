,VeganFreak,2008-01-30T19:42Z,"Cindymwood - Check your program settings/preferences/options which control video picture quality. If that doesn't work, use a different program. You can download plenty of programs via TPB that can do the video conversion (AVI to DVD). Many programs only require a few clicks, and very little technical knowledge of the process. This AVI file isn't as good a quality as a real DVD but it definitely shouldn't be 'blurry' if you convert the file properly. It is time-consuming to do this right, waiting for the encoding process, so be patient, and good luck!"
