,54peace,2008-01-07T04:03Z,The Algebra II was corrupt and would not play and the several of the Geometry played upside down and backwards.  Please re-upload the Algebra II separately. 
[V],dohduhdah,2008-01-07T19:34Z,"I have not checked all the videos. Sometimes I do encounter errors and sometimes I need to use a different player if one player doesn't play back the files. 
I just checked and I was able to play the majority of the algebra II avis (though I get an error notification with many of them in videolan). I don't see what difference it would make uploading algebra II seperately. You can configure azureus in such a way that you only download the algebra II course from the highschool collection."
,54peace,2008-01-12T15:39Z,All those currently seeding the Algebra II are seeding a corrupt file the only way to correct the problem is to reupload the uncorrupted original under a different name.  I've tried 6 different players all with the same error.  Even tried to repair it myself...didn't work.    I love the series and would like my daughter to review the upper level math as well.   Thanks again.
[V],dohduhdah,2008-01-18T08:44Z,"Tell you what, if you send me an email, I can share details of my ftp and you can download individual files from any of the courses in this torrent so you can check if your version is corrupted. (dohduhdah AT yahoo DOT com)

,multikrus,2008-03-03T13:25Z,"I appriciate your ""high school"" upload but is there any you can divide file? so I can download the files, because I don't have that much space in my hard drive. thank in any case."
[V],dohduhdah,2008-03-11T02:41Z,"multikrus, usually you don't have to download the complete archive and you can selectively download certain parts (like individual courses in this case instead of the complete package of 5 courses)"
,pmscs,2008-10-18T02:56Z,"Hi dohduhdah, its nice of YOU that YOU have provided us with such information. If YOU please also provide us with the Guide book of high school course."
,pmscs,2008-10-19T13:34Z,"Hi multikrus, Did U receive any FTP from dohduhdah about High school. if U did then plz let me know"

,bellagitana,2009-02-13T16:17Z,"Thanks so much for making these available to all.  BTW, do these have guidebooks? And if so, do you have them?
Thanks again!"
,asands1,2009-02-13T23:52Z,"thanks a lot for the post.  I thought I should brush up on my basic math since many of my collegues have laughed jokingly at me for some basic lack of information in math lol.  Not that I havent learned this before (I went to a university and all) its just that ive forgotten how to do basic things because of calculators.  Anyways, id like to say the high school basic math is great to trry out even when you know the basics because the instructor shows new and easier methods to do things without cacultor that youve prolly never learned in high school and or college (like the lattice box method)

thanks bunches!"
