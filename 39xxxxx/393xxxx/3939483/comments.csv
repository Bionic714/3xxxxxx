,n1nj4Lo,2007-12-28T07:32Z,"Aye maciver, Isn't there a way you can add more seeders or something? I mean 1 to 138 Leechers really doesn't seem to cut it very well... If you could I'd be extremely grateful, As I'm sure pleanty of other users would be too... I'd help to continue to seed for as long I had this on my hard drive...
TIA"
,n1nj4Lo,2008-01-01T08:51Z,"Damnit all to hell...
Is there ANYWAY to CONTACT Users on this site? So we can let maciver6969 know he needs to reseed this, Since we're all stuck at 50 something precent..

uTorrent has been up and open for a whole day, I went to sleep being stuck at 53.3% and then when I came home at 11'ish I am still stuck at 53.3%, It's the only torrent downloading so it couldn't be anything stopping except whatever it is thats got us all stuck in the 50's..."
