The boys are each tethered to a live goat.  The first one to break the bond loses.  Kenny, who wants to have fun with his goat, cleverly uses an extremely long rope in hopes that Spenny will be stuck taking care of both goats.  Spenny tries his best to toilet train his goat and keep him smelling as pleasant as possible.  Though it\'s not easy, the goat is still a better roommate than Kenny.

Sorry everyone, but there was an error during capture towards the middle of the episode that resulted in 6 seconds that had to be removed, and is then followed by 1 minute of low quality video before returning to normal.
