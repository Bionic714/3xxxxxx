May not work properly because CIY release is outdated, some updated files are missing."
,grnthmb642004,2007-12-12T23:38Z,"this works with the ciy release....!!! 

working fixed exe file

,Liandri,2007-12-12T23:47Z,"grnthmb642004: No, it's another copy of cracked EXE from other updated release.

If there are issues or bugs due to missing files, you will discover them during playing the certain levels.

This torrent is stolen release without giving proper credits to original authors.
CIY isn't involved in cracked release any way."

Hey everyone,

I just wanted to point out that this is an indie game developed by two (THAT'S RIGHT, ONLY TWO) people. They created this game independantly and it is really a work of art. If you download this game and enjoy it and appreciate the years of hardwork that were put into it I urge you to consider buying it and supporting indie game developers:

It's different when a big corporate game developer like EA makes a game and makes millions, but these guys literally put two years of their lives into this game and like I said, anyone can see that it's an original piece of interactive art.

SUPPORT YOUR INDIE GAME DEVELOPERS! :)"
,Liandri,2007-12-13T10:57Z,"CrizzleG, you are definitely right."

,double0three,2007-12-13T23:08Z,"This game is definitely worth buying, you get a better game than most of the stuff you find in stores these days, and it's cheaper.  Support the indie developers!"
,double0three,2007-12-13T23:10Z,"PS demo is here:
