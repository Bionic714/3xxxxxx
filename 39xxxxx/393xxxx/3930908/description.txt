Following the huge success of 'Jimmy Carr Live' and 'Jimmy Carr Stand Up', the multi-award winning Jimmy Carr returns with his third live stand up DVD simply entitled 'Comedian'.

Recorded live at London's Bloomsbury Theatre, the posh-suited gagster unleashes his rapid-fire wit upon his audience with jokes that are just too rude for TV.

This is Jimmy's best yet. The main show is over an hour and a half long.

Jimmy plays to over 200,000 fans every year around Britain. Watch this DVD and see what all the fuss is about.
