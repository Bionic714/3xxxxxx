Notes: 
 ~ [] used to differentiate songs of the same name on the same album or compilation (to avoid issues when using programs that don't recognise track numbers when making duplicate-comparisons).


 ~ {} used to indicate different versions of songs released through 1988 (as listed in the Hamilton Discography, <URL:http://fucktheusa.info/robyn/hamilton/>).


 ~ For live tracks, the date of recording, rather than release, is used in tags.


 ~ I'll seed an update to this torrent following the release of the last of three more planned boxed sets.  In the meantime, feel free to peruse, below, the list of items known to be missing from this torrent.  If you've got any of these (or other items not listed here), and wouldn't mind sharing, please be in touch! Also, any contributions of missing artwork would be much appreciated.


 ~ A sequel to the *Glass Flesh* tribute disc, entitled (wait for it) *Glass Flesh II*, may be purchased at <URL:http://glasshotel.net/glassflesh/>.
