,ossieardiles,2007-12-19T08:38Z,"Impressive.
Is the single version of The Man Who Invented Himself included? DidnÂ´t find it at first glance."
,roger1000,2007-12-19T09:07Z,"

The single version is the same as the album version, as released by Armageddon.  The so-called ""Zinc Pear"" mix, as released by Rhino, is included under Black Snake's ""associated tracks"" album grouping."
,ossieardiles,2007-12-19T09:22Z,I see. Thanx for the info.

I know of something that I would have loved to have seen in it.  It is a promo only cd single(sorry I can't think of which song) with 7-8? older Bob Dylan covers.  I used to have a bad copy with really bad digi noise on a couple of the tracks.   "
