ONE ONLY per person...

Disk 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, OR 24 (more soon)

These can be forwarded to Gmail (email) only.

Each file is split into parts small enough to send by gmail.  

Suggest using Firefox browser with Gspace plugin.  Makes downloading/uploading a long list of files with single click.

send request to: thenave.dave@gmail.com"

textbook
workbook

Same as above - sent through GSpace in files approx 9meg, split using GSplit, with an *.exe that will recompile them when all finished dowloading.

As suggested to me by davethenave, I've set up some accounts just to keep these files in, then I can easily send them to others, or download them to any computer with Internet access! Works for me!! (you'll need 3 accounts if this is what you want to do, too!!)

If you are using Utorrent as your file share, highlight each file, double click then paste the above trackers.

The video course torrent files were created more than a year ago. It only has one tracker for pirate bay and is no longer recommended. Add all of the above trackers will make a big difference for connected peers and download speed.

,daveshelper,2008-01-06T03:45Z,"Thank you:

All who  seed this series of 25 disk. It's a long list and large files.

I'm asking your help. 

Please... After you complete a download Leave it to seed until a couple more people can take your place.

I've tried off and on for more than a year to make this teaching course available.

This is my last run. 

I'll be off the net in a couple of weeks. 

It's up to you whether these torrents live or die."
,arthurn,2008-03-16T11:23Z,"What kinda file format is this? Well, I can play it in my Win Media if I rename it to something like .mpeg. But I can't do anything with the original file and none of the converters seem to recognize it. I would love to get it on my IPod."
,daveshelper,2008-03-19T13:27Z,"This file was never intended for IPOD.
Renaming the file did NOT make it play on media player. Had you changed the file associations it would have played anyway.   mp4 IS a mpeg format.
Get Nero Recode, will convert anything you like."

I have tried for 3 years to keep these torrents seeded.

There just aren't enough people who continue to seed.

I am in process of uploading to the above link where it should remain available."

get this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3978885/Total_Video_Converter_3.11_crack_

Recode this teaching English course to .3gp files.  Now they are under 50 meg file size and play on any mobile phone.

Re- seed these files in .3gp .

I can't do it now, my only connection to the net is via mobile phone."
