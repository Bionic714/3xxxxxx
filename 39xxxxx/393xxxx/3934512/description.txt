(Description from VarÃ©se website)
In this follow-up to the worldwide hit Alien vs. Predator, the iconic monsters from two of the scariest film franchises ever, wage their most brutal battle yet in an unsuspecting Colorado town.

Visual effects specialists Greg and Colin Strause both make their feature directorial debut with this no-holds-barred monster mash that attempts to set itself apart from the 2004 Paul W.S. Anderson original by serving as a straight up sci-fi horror scare-fest.

The epic score by composer Brian Tyler is truly apocalyptic. Its a massive, driving, powerful orchestra assault that adds an exciting new opus to the previous franchise scores of Jerry Goldsmith (Alien), Alan Silvestri (Predator, Predator 2), James Horner (Aliens) and Elliot Goldenthal (Alien 3).
