,carolinawolf,2007-12-16T03:38Z,"any file that uses a serial to unlock will only work as long as you NEVER allow the program to access the internet.
after a period of time duplicate serials will show up and all will be banned. your program will stop working.
this happens because the software, will contact ""home"" and they will kill it.
make sure you have a firewall that asks your permission to allow a certain program to go on line. then you don't allow it to do so. {zonealarm} is one.
if you find a patch program {program unlocker} somewhere it will almost always show up as a virus, but it doesn't eat your computer just the program. thats what unlocks it.
i prefer the unlocker type even though it shows up as a virus, use it and then delete it out of the computer manually. 
just suggestions do as you like. "

,GuiGQc,2008-03-19T18:11Z,"Hey BTGuy, you are the best !! I have been using most of your software and indeed uploaded a lot of them to thank you.

But this Beta version (3.0.0.1) had many bugs and a new public non-beta version just came out today (ConvertXtoDVD 3.0.0.7) March 19th. I really hope you can work on it very soon since it repaired bugs with the aspect ratio, *.mkv delay problem with audio, and a lot more...

I hope you upload ConvertXtoDVD v3.0.0.7 (or higher if you have some contacts ;) ) as soon as possible please, I can't wait to burn *.mkv's (like .avi but for HD videos) to DVD."
