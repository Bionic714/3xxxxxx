,Forgeit,2008-03-02T13:41Z,"80zforever You are awesome...I am taking a liberty with your 80's collection, painting out the pops and scratches... I rarely use automated cleaning software....when it is finished I wil let you know...as an aside last year I was commisioned to video Chris Layhe (the bassist)doing some solo acoustic stuf including Icicle Works stuff up here in Yorkshire , England...
regards and keep up the good work.."
[V],80zforever,2008-03-10T00:10Z,Forgeit thx for the kind words. Let me know how the cleaning software did. Normally they make the sound so unnatural. cheers
