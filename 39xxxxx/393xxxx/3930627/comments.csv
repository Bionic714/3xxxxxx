,Baronen_swe,2008-03-16T16:52Z,"Includes ""Bleed America (2001)"" instead of ""Jimmy Eat World (1994)"" as it says in the nfo."
,callistosmile,2008-07-09T23:21Z,"Actually, Baronen_swe, they renamed it ""Jimmy Eat World"" after the 9/11 attacks. They switched it back to Bleed American this year for the deluxe reissue. The original name of ""Salt Sweat Sugar"" was also Bleed American but was changed after September 11."
