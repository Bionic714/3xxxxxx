,ROKKETTARO90,2007-12-13T07:33Z,Darkfiber all your files are fakes....all your sources are DVDsad you change the resolution from 720x576 to 1200x720! S**t!
[T],DaRkFib3r,2007-12-13T09:51Z,"Omg they are not DVDrips you dickhead. They are captured from a FreeToAir HDTV channel at 720p THIS DOES NOT MEAN that the physical source is 720p or even 1080p.

They are NOT resized on my end, they are captured at 720P and i scale them down a bit.

If you dont know what you're talking about dont post, or just dont download my stuff...enought people do & they are happy with the quality, as am i."
[T],DaRkFib3r,2007-12-13T10:01Z,If i resizes my videos from 1280x720 to 720x576 would it make you happy?? or would you still have a bitch about it??
[T],DaRkFib3r,2007-12-13T10:09Z,Or do i need to spell it out for you in every single upload?
,adin769,2007-12-13T18:07Z,"Hi DaRkFib3r, the quality is super, thanks for the music clips(demonoid upload,too). upload more files please. The 1200x720 rez. its for PC. and the 720x576 its optimal for DVD(divx) player's.
bye."

I could give you a long list of requests, but I won't...    I'm happy as long as you occasinally throw in some progessive electronic dance oriented stuff!

Keep em comin!"
