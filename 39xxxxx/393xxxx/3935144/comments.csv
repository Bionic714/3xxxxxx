,Core2All,2007-12-15T22:07Z,"Is this some new and updated and fixed version with patches, or is it the same old ToH RC2 that will speed up your fans if you have a P35 chipset?
It´s nice to get some info of stuff being uploaded here. I really appreciate it.."
,ParanoidDK,2007-12-15T22:11Z,Well the name clearly say RC2 and btw the thing speeding up your fans are the kernel.. you can still use the ToH and then install pc_efi and a vanilla kernel.
,Core2All,2007-12-15T22:43Z,"That is why i was asking if it was the same old image, because you can not be shure all the time. I think i rather wait for an image with efibootloader that actually works.."
,ParanoidDK,2007-12-15T23:06Z,"Well what i hear then that might take some time yet... But it is on the way. I cant even remember if i did use this image or the Kalaway image to install osx on my GA-P35-DQ6.. i tink i did use the kalaway and then just the bootfix image from this one. 

But are at the moment running OSX 10.5.1 with pc_efi and vanilla kernel this is just one of my freinds that did needet an image with an SSE2 kernel and well when only let one dl insted of sharing. 
"
,ParanoidDK,2007-12-16T02:14Z,"Just to make this clear.

THIS IS NOT AN NEW RELEASE. THIS IS THE SAME ToH THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN HERE. IT IS JUST REUPLOADET.

Så please dont get your self kickede on the irc asking about it."
,Core2All,2007-12-16T09:00Z,"ParanoidDK, i have tried to find a working guide for pc_efi that is not confusing and using incorrect steps and english, but nothing have worked so far. Is there a proper install available that is painfree?
I would appreciate help on this to use Leopard as i´m tired of the old Tiger after trying Leopard on my Mac and PC."
,northernpal,2007-12-16T15:32Z,"Core2all,
Look on "" InsanelyMac Forum"" ( http://forum.insanelymac.com/ ) for many guides and help on getting Hackintosh working."
,Core2All,2007-12-16T18:11Z,"Thanx northernpal.
I have tried several guides, but still no success unfortunatley. Not sure what it can be, but i know that it does not work for all even if things are done right. It´s very frustrating. I have tried both MBR and GUID pc_efi. I have tried all i could find, but still my comp refuses to boot. My chipset is a P35 DP35Dp motherboard wich many have and also had no problems with."
,ParanoidDK,2007-12-16T19:02Z,"Core2All...
