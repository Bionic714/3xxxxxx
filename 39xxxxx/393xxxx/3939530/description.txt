Special Programs
Mr. Beck occasionally airs full-hour interviews. Interviewed people include Ron Paul, Al Sharpton, Janice Dickinson, Larry King, Nancy Grace, and others.

Special programming includes Exposed: The Extremist Agenda, Exposed: The Climate of Fear, and a weeklong series titled America's Addiction, about pornography. These programs don't tend to include the usual humor and sarcasm used in Beck's shows, presumably due to the largely serious nature of the content of these programs.


Exposed: The Extremist Agenda
The Extremist Agenda, aired in November 2006, which overviewed terrorism in the Middle East.


Exposed: The Climate of Fear
The May 2, 2007 edition of his Glenn Beck on Headline News was a "special report" entitled, "Exposed: The Climate of Fear". In his opening remarks, Beck said, "Welcome to exposed, the climate of fear. I want you to know right up front, this is not a balanced look at global warming. It is the other side of the climate debate that you don't hear anywhere. Yes, Al Gore, there is another credible side.
