" After his ?Blap EP? (Poker Flat 39), his remix for Guido Schneider?s ?Oh My Buffer? (Poker Flat 53) and his DJ mix on ?Poker Flat Volume Four? (pfrcd14) we are happy to welcome back Mr. Jeff Samuel with his new EP ?Fire?!Jeff has been constantly building his profile as a DJ, producer and remixer over the last few years and has released much appreciated 12?es as well as his debut album ?Step? on Trapez in 2006. Apart from that, Jeff also relocated to Seattle where he works as SFX sound designer for video games.The new 12? ?Fire? is a great snappy and propellent tune with some squeaking synths and a stomping beat. An excellent starting point for two brilliant remixes. The first remix is done by Claude VonStroke who runs his Tech-Funk label Dirtybird from San Francisco. In this remix Claude adds more dirt to the synthies and as the track goes on, more distortion .The second remix has been done by St. Sebastian (aka Gamal Sebastian Kaba) who has released two 12?es on Dessous Recordings with a third one coming up. St. Sebastian has already created his own signature sound which is apparent in his ?Adrenal? mix of ?Fire?, here he focusses on the more squeaky tunes and rebuilds the track in rather reduced outfit, with a great messy break in the middle.An awesome package that will set the dancefloors on fire!
