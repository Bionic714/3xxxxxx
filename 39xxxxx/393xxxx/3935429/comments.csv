,ptnick,2008-11-26T03:42Z,why did you strip the spanish subtitles and audio? 
,mr_piechee,2008-12-08T20:22Z,How do you expand all the individual archives? i keep getting errors on lots of the .rar files... i'm using stuffit expander (mac)

You say that the dvd contains the languages english, portuguese and spanish.
BUT THERE IS NO SPANISH AUDIO!!!!
why would you strip the spanish audio away?!
no reason to do that and then still say that the spanish language is available!!!!"
