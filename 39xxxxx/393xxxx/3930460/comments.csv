This looks just like something the bacon would put out to attract somebody of like mental capacity. Plus why would you want to download this when all you have to do is search axxo and all his files pop up.

Our Ripper, who art on mininova,
aXXo be thy name.
Thy torrents come.
Seeding will be done,
Here as it was on suprnova.
Give us this day our latest rips.
And forgive us our leeching,
As we forgive those that leech from us.
And lead us not on to private trackers;
But deliver us from the MPAA:
For thine is the ripping, the seeding, and the glory,
For ever and ever.

If you live in the USA or anywhere that it is illegal to use these programs DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS! Paramount and other companies are watching every one of these torrents.

This is not a joke, I am very serious! I do not know exactly what can happen but I would advise you to just stay away from Axxo's stuff altogether because clearly he got arrested and now they are watching his shit. I know it sux because he was a great part of this site but unless you want to wind up like him I would just get the movie from somebody else.

2. Classic media player.
3. DivX player.
4. Go download yourself a Codec light package....

And if a video doesn't work after all those, Its not a good vid file. Or you haven't uncompressed  it right.

[V],lord_terabyte,2008-06-10T19:57Z,"How lame. aXXo's rips are generally pieces of crap. It would be better if people learned how to make good rips themselves for the community instead of downloading rips by aXXo and/or the ""Scene"".

Hint: 1CD (700MB) rips are never enough for a color movie over 45 minutes long. Rips should have a bitrate of about 1,500 for color NTSC sources, less for PAL, and less for Black and White. The BPP (quality factor) should always be between 2.225 and 2.500 for a top quality color rip, but 2.000 is more than enough for a Black and White film. Want to see a good rip? Check out some of my recent uploads that I ripped myself. I have to admit when I started out I knew nothing about rips, and I downloaded some aXXo crap too."

PLEASE wait about 4 months until the Blu-ray is released, then you can download it in 1080p or 720p. Downloading it now, just to see it in a crappy quality, is just REALLY stupid. Always wait for the blu-ray!"

and why is the movie going so slow, its like 0.5kbs/s on average..aprox time, 2d15hrs =\

does any1 know any free websites i can view movies on ??"

d3m0nyo666: aXXo is gone.  Other people upload torrents in his name but it's not really him.

Dillon0Moore:  Pirates don't help other non-pirates.

People having problems viewing:  Errors sometimes occur with WMP and WinAMP with avi files.  VLC media player is a good solution to that.  It has better volume and simple options and I never have any errors.  ESPECIALLY with aXXo's work."

You have no clue what your talking about. First of all, read the title of the torrent. It's not one by ""axxo"" nor does he claim it is, or even portray it as being done by him. This is just a list of all his movies, or so ""MrRock2000"" is stating. Not just that, ""axxo"" has other people who do uploading for him as well. Idiot."
