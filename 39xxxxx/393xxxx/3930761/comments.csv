,Bamimi,2007-12-12T16:32Z,"all selectively edited and modified to show whatever purpose the director wants to show. if youre intelligent then you're intelligent to know that. I could easily take a million clips from anywhere and only show the snippets of what I want others to see and make it appear as the 'real' story, but the truth is it never is."
,duhprane,2007-12-13T04:42Z,"Yes, Bamimi, you could snippet away at footage, but clearly you dont actually *make* or have made ANY FUCKING THING AT ALL.

I tell you what, go make something and then come back and let us say that same phoney shit about whatever lame ass butt-clitt porno you come up with.

I'll do you one better, just Shut The Fuck Up."

,Up_Load,2007-12-13T20:40Z,"duhprane, if only you would keep your mouth shut, then people won't know how stupid you are."
,spacey1,2007-12-14T07:00Z,"   That's what a documentary is ~ a position backed up by information and video.  None are 100% unbiased.  Again, the seed is still at 1, and zero of you have even watched this video yet, but are so ready to show your impatient anger. 

   Ever notice how it's people who've never uploaded anything that are the whiniest and angriest?  Up_Load uploads nothing."
,spacey1,2007-12-14T07:05Z,"Bamimi uploaded one thing, no seeds, with a trojan in it...nice guy."
,Up_Load,2007-12-14T13:38Z,Sorry spacey1. Will try harder. Promise.

,Halbermunken,2008-01-08T16:13Z,"Well of course many soldiers change they opinions once they're on the battlefield, it's all quiet on the western front all over again.

And the leaders almost always have to lie to get the common to join the military. Before it was done by force, so now you need to lie."
,Homes223,2008-01-25T22:46Z,Seed Please!
