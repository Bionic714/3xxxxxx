,ektakrome,2008-02-03T06:46Z,"Thanks for helping us get a peek at this wonderful film, and BIG thanks going out to the seeders who have been giving up their bandwidth to help people like me download the file.

I definitely wanna buy this now."
,ektakrome,2008-02-03T23:14Z,VTS_01_6 doesn't seem to have any audio with it. Does anyone else have this problem?
,brianisbrilliant,2008-03-07T17:07Z,"i thought dvd's were 4.7 gb ? i know this is probably a codec thing, i'm just curious."
,musikastor,2008-03-16T10:36Z,"brianisbrilliant.
Nope. DVDs can be 4.7 Gbs and 8.5 Gbs (dual layer). This is a rip from a dual layer disc. As the concert/documentary was shot on HD, it makes sense to release it on a dual layer DVD, or even in the future on blue ray, the winning format in the brief HD DVD war. 
Excellent film, btw"
,Dark.Forgotten,2008-03-25T11:00Z,"First of all, thank you for the upload! But when I tried to write these files to DVD-Video using Nero it said something like this:
1) Backup file 'VIDEO_TS.BUP' should be identical to 'VIDEO_TS.IFO'
2) Backup file 'VTS_01_0.BUP' should be identical to 'VTS_01_0.IFO'
3) DVD-Video files compliance test failed

Is it supposed to be like that?"
