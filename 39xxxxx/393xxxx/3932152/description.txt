Those of you getting to grips with a bit more history of John Dahlback's very diversely skilled work will certainly appreciate this release.

It should also be noted with equal importance, that the Tom Pooks track contained here is excellent, and it is a production that I re-visit with frequency.


Short review at time of release:

" Latest taste of something 'Extra' from the Kompakt crew is a real stormer headlined by John Dahlback and Frenchman Tom Pooks. JD is up first with an uplifting slice of electronic house masked in retro 80's synth melodies tweaked stabs and a tough electro house groove. On the flip Tom Pooks drops 'Life' an acidic techy workout with strings to die for! "
