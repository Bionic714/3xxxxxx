Then hold your shift key down and hit the restart button to go into safe boot. You may want to put something on the shift key to hold it down cause it took like 30 mins for me. Then login to your user account. Go to the applications folder and there you will find a folder called Symantec Solutions. inside is the uninstall. That should be easy enough. After the restart there will still be a symantec folder in the apps, toss it, go to spotlight type in symantec and you will find one or two other things to toss out. There you have it. You should copy/paste and print this out cause the only way to get into your computer after installing this is a safe boot. OK, that was a waste of 2 1/2 hours of my time, thanks. OH, I also ran AppleJack, gotta love that for clearing out the crap and checking everything out, AppZapper is another must have app."
,Shunnabunich,2007-12-15T06:43Z,"I feel so, so sorry for the 52 of you who are unfortunate enough to have a Symantec software product on your Macs right now. I wish you the best of luck in your ordeal."
,Macsolo,2007-12-15T13:25Z,Review of 2005 is it soo old??
,findermix,2007-12-15T19:11Z,"Only for for 60 days, need serial.
No have news aportations, relantize the system.
Need antivirus on Mac?????."
,b451c,2007-12-15T19:24Z,"You don't need virus program for mac.
You can have virus on your mac though but you won't be affected. You can use virus app if you wan't to protect your pc friends if you send files to them."
,CrankyBird,2008-05-10T23:13Z,"Sorry, I can't find AppleJack on this site. If it's so good why isn't it listed. I use a MAC os 10.5.2 intel leopard.
Thanks!"
,Lss_1405,2008-06-14T13:34Z,"Thanks :D !!

Can u run an update?"
,nacho299,2008-07-13T06:52Z,"Works great thanks :)
the only problem: scanning time is painfully slow up to five hours."
,mac-idiot,2008-10-03T08:01Z,S/N please
,Rob.Brooks,2009-06-22T15:37Z,"This works great, but

KEPP IN MIND

if you use TIME MACHINE, this will slow your backups for the first couple times.  (Especially if you use a TIME CAPSULE)"
,SystemFolder,2009-08-23T05:33Z,"Here's how to keep this software up to date forever, or at least for over a year.
This works for version 11 and probably will work for other versions.
I assume you have NAV installed and have updated it once and it shows a Subscription Expiration Date in the Statistics section of the main window.
1. Open Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access
2. Click on Show Keychains in the lower left corner.
3. Select the Symantec keychain.
4. Select the keys in this keychain and delete them, but do not delete the keychain itself.
5. Open NAV and check the Subscription Expiration Date. It should now say Unknown and should stay that way even after you update.

Make sure to do this before your expiration date expires because this hack may not work after it expires. Also make sure to allow NAV any and all connections to the internet with Little Snitch. NAV noes not phone home to check registration or other nastiness."
,ajarnmark,2009-08-27T15:46Z,"Systemfolder gave us a great tip. I did just as he wrote and it worked, with the message reading unknown in the expiration date. Then after a few seconds it gave me one year from today, which is fine, for hopefully we can do it again. Good looking out!"
,SystemFolder,2009-08-28T00:04Z,"Here's how it worked for me. After installing NAV 11 on Dec 2, 2008 I noticed that the subscription would expire in a year. So, I poked around my system, found the keychain and deleted it. After updating I noticed the keychain came back, so then I only deleted the keys in the keychain and saw that the expiration date became ""unknown"" and stayed that way even after updating. A few months later, after an update, I saw that the subscription expiration date had changed from ""unknown"" to ""N/A"", which I think stands for Not Applicable."
,flixman,2010-01-22T02:34Z,"For anyone who doesn?t know, the reason why you need an antivirus on mac is because if you are on a network that has windows based pc?s as well then a virus could be on your mac computer and not affect it but can be hurting the other window based pc(s) on your network"
,shotosrev,2010-03-23T18:07Z,You do need an antivirus for your mac. I actually had a virus on my mac one time so they do exist. I suggest you go to ClamxAV.com and download their really good free antivirus for macs. Thats what I use.
,HIggyBaby,2010-06-05T05:45Z,"Do what ""SystemFolder' Said to do with the Keychain. Works fine. Gave me an extra year.
So much better than re installing it every year ... Peace out fellas"
,anji1,2010-10-31T01:09Z,what is the password for the key chain access?
,taciasar,2011-06-29T08:13Z,"hey dude its saying auto update error
