Including the rest of what is an outstanding career of cinematic performances by Mr. Forrest Whitaker. Don't do it!! Back away, and put down the mouse. Do it for the sake of the children, you thoughtless b#%&@$ds!!!"

,socratron,2009-08-04T04:45Z,"Great torrent, thanks a lot, just one observation, for the people that live in America, it would be dificult to play because the dvd is not region free, you may have to change the region of your laptop or dvd player in order to play it, but if you do so, there's a posibility that you will not be able to change the region back, so, what i´m trying to say here is tath you should burn this using Clone DVD, because that program will unlock the region of the VTS folder and burn it in to a region free disc, and yo must use the option that says: ""Clone DVD"" an select the VTS folder as the source, if you don´t do it this way and instead you use the option ""Write existing files"" (or something like that) the software will not unlock the region and you won't be able to play the DVD, i had do it both ways and only cloning the  VTS folder worked for me.  Hope this help some of you guys, an remember, this is only for people that live outside Europe. If you don´t have Clone DVD there are several torrents in this site that should help you."
