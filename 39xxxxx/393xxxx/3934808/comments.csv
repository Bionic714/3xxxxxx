,T-1OOO,2007-12-16T03:08Z,"I will seed as much as I can, be patient though.. It's almost 30 GB to upload.."
,Elynitthria,2007-12-18T10:28Z,Excellent! I am downloading yours now and will keep seeding for a while.
,macnolias,2007-12-23T17:01Z,Damn T could you try to do individual seasons instead of 1 massive download?  Look at your seinfeld collection how that's doing   1kb a sec for eternity... 
,T-1OOO,2007-12-24T19:48Z,That's because idiots doesn't share! I will not upload individual uploads! why? because you can use a client like utorrent and prioritize your download within the torrent or select what episode you want! If people start seeding instead of just leeching then piratebay would be a much better place.. I will seed as much as I can and when I feel like the torrent is strong enough to run by itself then I will let it run by itself.. but people needs to start sharing! that's the problem!
,SkaryMonk,2008-01-09T22:43Z,"This is a very awesome torrent, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Thanks a million."

Thank you very much for uploading.
Could anybody recommend a good free programme to resize?
Some of the episodes in season three and four are very small  even when played in full screen on windows media player.
Thanks again "
