,felipe1982,2008-04-04T01:28Z,Are these PS1 games? Or PS2 games? Are they working well? Are they ISO's? Is it passworded?
,AtlasPSX,2008-04-16T20:53Z,"Yes, original PS1. They work fine. They're bin/cue for each disc. Why would I password them?"
,Dukeman,2008-05-18T15:16Z,"Someone is seeding this at 1500 kB/s.
That adds up to 3 great playstation games with a total download time of about 30 minutes.

You, sir or madam, are a credit to the ""force"".
Thank you!"
,AtlasPSX,2008-05-20T17:28Z,"Hehe, that was me on a test machine. It was going faster a little later on :)"
,imadsen,2008-05-27T05:34Z,How does this work with PS3? Doesn't it have to be modded or something?
,AtlasPSX,2008-06-01T12:12Z,"You can either use a hacked PS3, or you can boot this up via memory stick/USB with a certain program."
,AtlasPSX,2008-07-07T11:16Z,No prob! :D
,Skytzofrenik,2008-07-26T15:43Z,"hi, first of all this is an EPIC torrent, thanks so much for this, but i have come across a problem

i do not have a psx unfortunately and am running this off the psx emulator, now they play great aside from the fact that problems arise when i try to save to the memory card files (other games save to these perfectly) and errors range from psxfin freezing to it saying Save Failed every time...

can anyone help me or inform me why this is happening?

thanks"
,Skytzofrenik,2008-07-26T15:46Z,"another thing i forgot to mention, but this problem happens with ALL 4 TONY HAWK GAMES...

and just to state once again, never had any problems like this with ANY other bin/cue files, they all save perfectly...

and thanks again in advance if anyone can help me or at least clear this up..."
,jedz,2008-10-19T07:22Z,are these PAL or NTSC?
,AtlasPSX,2008-12-29T18:38Z,"use ePSXe for an emulator, latest version. Google it. That'll solve that problem :)

Also these are NTSC. It says it in the name, but it got cut off."
,Prince_Ghost,2009-01-27T19:06Z,thanks. im going to use my ps1 emulator xD
,AtlasPSX,2009-01-30T23:36Z,"Awesome. Make some videos if you'd like, YouTube lacks good ones ;p"
