,rockstar11998,2008-03-05T05:50Z,TaoBaba1008 you are a smart man.  Islam is about forcing all of the world to submit to their faith or die.  I don't know of any true God that would force death on everyone of the nonbelievers.  Islam is just a perverted from of Christianity.  Satan at his best.  Satan wishes to take free will away from everyone.  That's why he was kicked out of heaven.  Now he uses false religions to do his dirty work of spreading lies and fear.
