In this remarkable and educational 42-minute presentation Herb Meyer - former Reagan Administration senior Intelligence official, former associate editor of Fortune, author of several books and dozens of published essays about politics and economics - talks seriously about what is really going on out there:



    *      What lies behind the terrorists' attacks on our country?

    *      How does radical Islam really threaten our survival?

    *      Why was "regime change" necessary in Iraq and Afghanistan, and what else must we do to stop terrorism once and for all?

    *      Within the US itself, are we really in the midst of a "Second Civil War" that will decide whether our traditional culture survives?

    *      Why are the Judeo-Christian concepts of marriage and family under such ferocious attack?

    *      Is this "Second Civil War" the reason our politics has become so partisan, so divisive, and so vicious?

    *      What are the economic threats that loom before us?

    *      How will the demographic crises in Western Europe and Japan hurt us?

    *      Can our economy survive its own demographic problems?

    *      Most of all, what must we do to defend civilization itself, and to assure that our children understand what Western Civilization really is and why it's worth defending? 



In The Siege of Western Civilization, Herb Meyer answers these questions, and more, in a lively, informal way.  He "connects the dots" so that you can see how today's fast-breaking developments at home and abroad form a pattern you can understand -- and make sense of - as you follow the news.
