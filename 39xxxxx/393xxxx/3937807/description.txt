Amazon.co.uk Review
That these two furnace-tonsilled brothers from Leith, Scotland remain almost uniquely celebrated for a pair of songs from the tail end of the 80s is, on one hand, a tribute to the undimmed magnificence of said songs--"I?m Gonna Be (500 Miles)" especially verges on national anthem status, still holding court everywhere from wedding discos, student radio, Match of the Day backdrops and drunken sing-alongs home from the pub. But on the other that simply disregards the sturdy trunk of work they?ve built up since. A revitalised Proclaimers have in recent years been creeping up on festival crowds hanging about waiting for the hits, and unexpectedly enthralling them with hand-chiselled choruses and wild, windswept gusto--seventh album Life with You is accordingly the perfect accompaniment to more familiar distractions. Throughout 13 muscular tracks they strike Motown, folk, blues and rock ?n? roll sparks into heartfelt, melodic pop blazes bellowed by that deliciously thick Scottish brogue. "Here It Comes Again" is a frenzied highlight, bouncing off the walls like a yo-yoing Joe Cocker cameo in The Commitments, and "In Recognition" and "Whole Wide World" are true anthems both, building from that familiar muted acoustic foundation, the former illustrating the clawing wit that sometimes pervades their writing and the latter an adorable chest-beating love song. The Proclaimers are very much still walking. --James Berry
