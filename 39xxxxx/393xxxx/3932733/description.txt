Second release of Ryoku Stock Photography. All images are in very high resolution and under Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 License. The theme of the second issue is "The Forest". Note: Images are tagged in German.

It's a copy of this torrent: 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3932230/Stock_Photography__Ryoku_Vol._2___The_Forest_(Creative_Commons)

except unzipped, so you can look at it without saving a second copy for seeding. (The zip is only 0.6% smaller, so it did not make sense to use a zip in this case.)
