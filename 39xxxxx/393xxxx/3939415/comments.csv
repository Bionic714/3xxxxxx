,firebird_1999,2008-02-17T07:45Z,"I installed the extension package and it stated it was installed sucessfully. I searched for it in my plug ins directory in Maya and it wasn't there. So, I searched and located it in my c drive. I found the file and loaded it in Maya, but nothing happened. It states that it could not find the files. So, does that mean I will have to copy the script files to maya itself and what files do I have to transfer over to get it to work.? If someone can list the files that would need to be transfered I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks."
