I suggest you refrain from uploading too many torrents at any one time! OK?"
,spacey1,2007-12-17T08:45Z,"i suggest you refrain from giving uploading advice, when you upload nothing.  if you can't wait 48hrs. for a free video, then feel free to buy it."

,james_longley,2008-02-18T08:18Z,"You know, I worked hard to make this film. I lived in Iraq for two years straight to make this film. Iraq -- so you know -- is not a fun place to live. After a while, it seemed like every morning I was getting woken up by car bombs going off. My life was threatened. The lives of the people I was filming were threatened. One of the translators I worked with was later killed. 

I did not receive a salary while making this film -- I went through production on my own, small dime, using the royalties from my last film. I lived in cheap Baghdad apartments and $5/night hotels in Najaf, crawling with roaches, and no air conditioning in mid-summer. I am not a trust fund baby. Making films is how I make a living.

I'm not complaining about what it took to make this film -- it was my own choice to work on this subject, and I know that lots of people are going to download it for free. 

But I just want you to know that when you upload and download my film, you are stealing from me. You are stealing from an independent filmmaker. You are making it harder for me to keep on being independent, harder for me to keep on making my films. 

I just want you to know that when you take my film you are a thief, stealing from a person -- a person who probably has less money than you. I am not a movie studio with billions of dollars. I depend on the royalties from my films to live and work.

This film is available for legal purchase -- on amazon.com , Netflix , and on and on. It is legally available in many countries. If you really want to watch it, why not buy it / rent it?

Just a suggestion."

,soar,2008-02-19T16:58Z,"I wouldn´t ever even heard about this movie, James Longley, if it wasn´t for The pirate bay.. 

you are reaching a whole new field of audience that you wouldn´t reach if TPB didn´t exist. 

Be happy for that. and thanks for the movie. "
,phrogxix,2008-03-14T23:39Z,"Mr. Longley, 

Why not instead embrace this community that is sharing your movie out of genuine interest in it and try to work it towards your favor? A good example of this is The Man from Earth. The producers of the film thanked file sharers for helping to promote their film in a way they could never have, asked them to spread the word by reviewing the film on sites like IMDB and Amazon and they set up a Paypal account with the suggestion that downloaders send a rental fee or whatever they thought appropriate. 

I liked Man From Earth so much after downloading it on a torrent that I turned around and bought the DVD and have spread the word about the film to countless people. Google the title, or read the Wiki entry. 

Heck, Nine Inch Nails is making headlines right now by embracing the online community and spinning things their way.

If it's going to get shared like this, why not try to spin it towards your favor? You admit yourself that people are going to download it regardless and you know that.

Just a thought or two. I respect your work and effort, as do a lot of file sharers... "
,TheHobbit54,2008-03-27T11:40Z,"Dear Mr. Longley

 Thank you very much for your great effort. I admire your sense of independence.

 I am going to download it, because I really need to know more about Iraq (because I live in Iran), and I have no access to any legal shop offering the video (because I live in Iran). 

 Just wrote it to say I am so sorry about it, and would love to pay for it if it was possible. I am a faithful Muslim and really like to follow the path of truth. Sometimes, I manage to pay for what I have downloaded by asking some friends to buy me a copy when they are going to travel abroad. I will try to do that about your movie asap."
,james_longley,2008-04-10T23:13Z,"Dear phrogxix:

Though I would certainly appreciate any insightful reviews of my film on IMDb and Amazon.com, etc --  I certainly cannot place a PayPal link on PirateBay because I would be sued by the distribution company with whom I have a contract. 

While posting a PayPal link or other arbitrary payment system might work for  established artists like Radiohead, who have already had years of promotion and exposure within the traditional distribution system, it is certainly not effective for a relatively unknown independent filmmaker who is not promoted as a brand to which consumers show loyalty, as pop music groups generally are. 

Of course I do appreciate that illegal downloading may be the only way that some people will be able to see my film, and I have no particular objection to that. But I think people who download independent films for free in places where they're readily available for legal purchase are doing a disservice to the filmmakers and the entire idea of self-financing, independent media -- unless that media is created specifically with free downloading in mind and is financed through some other source (which would tend to indicate that it's not really independent media.) just my 2c."
,sith7,2008-05-11T17:25Z,"really james, is filling your pocketbook more important than people actually seeing your film, did you make the film to make money or to enlighten people about the situation in Iraq? if it is the former, then I have no problem ripping you off, as you exploit the suffering of Iraqis, if it is the latter you should have no problem with bootleg distribution, no different from watching it ota on cbc. I'm a university student and independent reporter myself and your not-radiohead argument is bogus, I run a small website and with donations there and part time job I get by alright, there is no reason you could not have set up a contractual clause to allow donations and digital distribution, or adding a ""if you liked this film please donate"" message to the end. In short be happy your work is appreciated and in this new digital world the old distribution lines are finally collapsing as they should. If I follow your suggestion and go rent your film the old way, how much of the 8 dollar rental charge lands in your bank account? you want to talk about theivery.. "
,highlyunlikely,2009-12-07T12:47Z,"I have just signed up to TPB and come across your discussion. I am a writer and producer in the early stages of my career currently battling to get a feature film made (going well so far!).

I understand very much the struggle to pay bills when working as an independent in the industry, but I have to agree that pirate downloads are a great thing and something that we as filmmakers should embrace.

Yes it will be a slow start as we work out ways that we can make these films and still afford to eat, but this struggle is part of the game. We are lucky enough to be a part of a digital nouvelle vague.

,R2d6.51,2011-06-24T02:23Z,"Even though I was hammered all my life to buy into the notion of putting a profit on everything you invest your life in, but I got to tell you God only knows how much money I earned as a Firefighter/Paramedic that was shared with other people to enjoy life for which Ineer asked for a dime of it back. Notwithstanding the fact I don't know how much of a premium you put on your life, but consider my worth today if those of us who do this work demended our income based on your ability to put your self wort up for sale to us when we come to yoiur door needing your life saved.

It should never be about the money. In fact Capitalism is destroying the Planet which is the dichotomy that gave birth to how you made the film in the first place.

 I ought to make a film about that. Catch my meaning?"
