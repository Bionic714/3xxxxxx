Hi there...

I'm at the moment being constantly monitored and hindered in sharing Christian material. For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed "only" two..

The people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called "free Nation" of the western world..
And then I'm accused of being a "conspiracy-theorist".. :-)

Anyway: This is a rare Vinyl-Rip for all you Jesus-People out there. The rip is at 192Kbps LAME mp3, and this is the real deal, no plastic-Jesus in here.. Please seed it for a while to keep it alive..

"Have you had Jesus-people knocking on your door?
Saying things you've never heard before?
Well, don't be getting mad.
Don't be feeling sad.
It won't be long, they'll be gone.."

and

"I walked a mile with pleasure. She chattered all the way. Left me none the wiser with all she had to say.
I walked a mile with sorrow. Never a word said she. But all the things I learned from her, when sorrow walked with me.."

..and you just got to hear Barry tell the story about when he was on a fishing boat, and encountered a dolphin, and then some.. :-) Priceless..
