REVIEW
Chicago House 86-91 distills only the best and most influential tracks from producers like Jefferson, Farley Jackmaster Funk, Phuture and Larry Heard. All of the most familiar tunes are here -- "Move Your Body," "Love Can't Turn Around," "Acid Trax," "No Way Back," "Can You Feel It," "You Used to Hold Me," "Your Love" -- and with a few arguable exceptions, only the best is included.
