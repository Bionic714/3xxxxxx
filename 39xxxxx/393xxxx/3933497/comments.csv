Den nya koden mailas tydligen till alla registrarade användare. Tillbaka till Trial om man inte har den koden... Skulle nån ha den nya koden vore det en bra ide att posta den här... "

,scienceofsound,2009-04-06T01:24Z,"got this info from jody b designs from another torrent site and it works people. (THIS IS FOR 3.7.5 RUNNING ON WINDOWS XP)

First, remove all traces of sound spectrum from your pc (uninstall g force using add/remove programs. Next delete remaining soundspectrum folder from your hard-drive (Usually in C:\ Program files). Next, search for soundspectrum and then gforce using search option in start bar and delete anything that appears in search results. Finally select run in start bar and type REGEDIT and press enter. Then press Ctrl+f and type in soundspectrum and press enter. Delete any highlighted entries. Repeat previous step but type in gforce instead of soundspectrum and delete any highlighted entries. Unplug your internet connection, install gforce program and then input the serial given with the download/program (usually in a wordpad file). Next block all FOUR gforce applications in your firewall.

Next goto C:\program files//soundspectrum/g-force/resources/common/boot start.txt

open this boot start.txt file (opens in notepad) and in the first few lines it has the following (just change it to match what it says here below and save)

BindEvent( SS_KEY_DOWN_EVENT | SS_SHIFT_KEY_CODE | 'C', "" \
if ( GetPref( PREF_CHECK_FOR_UPDATES ) > 0 ) { \
SetPref( PREF_CHECK_FOR_UPDATES, 0, false ); \
print( \""Check for updates OFF\n\"" ); } \
else { \
SetPref( PREF_CHECK_FOR_UPDATES, 999, false ); \
print( \""Check for updates ON (set to every 999 days)\n\"" ); \
} \

then go to
C:\Documents and Settings\Admin\Application Data\SoundSpectrum\G-Force
in here there will be a file called version update info it should be a notepad type file. open this file and go right to the end after the last "";"" copy and paste your product license and save the file. now when you open media player it will ask you to enter the product license enter the same code as you used before and that should be it.

You can also block your computer and realplayer (its the application 'I' use to listen to music) from connecting to the soundspectrum website by pasting the following:

www.realplayer.com
realplayer.com
www.real.com
real.com
uk.real.com
www.soundspectrum.com
soundspectrum.com

into your computers hostfile list located at
C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc

the file is called hosts and can be opened using wordpad
and make sure you copy the numbers that are there next to 'local host' in the host file to begin with, before each of the above web addresses you enter for it to work.

make sure you don't use winamp on your computer because it is mentioned in the wordpad files in the g-force program itself and i think somehow makes it revert to a trial version

have fun"
