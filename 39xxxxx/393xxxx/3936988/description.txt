A Clash of Kings picks up where A Game of Thrones ended. The Seven Kingdoms are plagued by civil war, while the Night's Watch mounts a reconnaissance force north of the Wall to investigate the mysterious people, known as wildings, who live there and, in the distant east, Daenerys Targaryen continues her quest to return to and conquer the Seven Kingdoms.
