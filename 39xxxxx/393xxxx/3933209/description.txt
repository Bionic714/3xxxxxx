Karloff-THRILLER 136 Pigeons From Hell

Car trouble forces two young brothers to spend a terrifying night in a dilapidated and seemingly abandoned Louisianan manor house where they encounter some birds that seem to have a strong dislike for intruders.
This is one of the best known episodes in the series, dreamy rather than terrifying with it's sense of night suffocating the daylight even outside the house.
