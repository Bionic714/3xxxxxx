,ashasaur,2008-03-24T05:03Z,"I thought that I included a README in this thing, but in case I didnt, somply extract the archive to C:\Program Files\SEGA\ and then run the Online.exe and it will update itself to the latest version automatically.  And BTW, if that directory isnt already made, just make one yourself and your good to go...hope that helps!"

,nicexero,2008-07-23T18:01Z,Someone please seed for me.
,sgadams,2008-07-24T18:09Z,can someone please seed?
,KatastrophExKore,2008-08-09T08:43Z,"It would be cool if people seeded this..please? :]

I remember PSO on xbox...are there any differences on the PC version?? "
,Nosfesix,2008-09-08T12:03Z,"And after that what ? I extract the folder in my computer (C:\Program Files\SEGA\) launch the online.exe, update my files... I launch the game but i can't play it : i can't write my ID and my password. "
,ashasaur,2008-09-16T05:30Z,"are you using windows vista?  if so, you need to goto the schthack forums and download the vista fix in order to type in-game."
,NekoMaster,2008-10-27T11:19Z,"WTF! Every time I try to update or run the game My Anti Virus Keeps Poping up a Virus Message Saying that it found a trojan!
Is this really a virus or is it just my Anti Virus Picking up weird code like how most AVs think keygens are a virus"
,ashasaur,2008-10-29T01:55Z,"Yah, that virus thing is annoying, for whatever reason-the new version of the online.exe file is recognized as a virus.  Some prick submitted it as a virus to McAfee, and so now every other AV program says that it is a trojan.  Just turn off your AV program while it updates, then run the game, than you can turn your AV back on and it shouldnt do it again."
,eightbithero,2008-11-04T05:30Z,"I can vouch that the virus alert is a false positive.  I did some searching around and it looks like avast is just taking their sweet time decriminalizing it.  I'm running it now and everything works great.  Only problem is that there appears to be a custom OGG set, which isn't bad if you like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night music."
,Mikoc,2008-11-15T02:39Z,"SEED!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I AVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,yamaruxninja,2009-01-05T23:11Z,"Ok..I downloaded just thought I would try offline for a second but dont see one,does this game not have offline?Only online mode?If so does that mean I can just save online.exe  to my desktop for quick start up?"
,ashasaur,2009-01-25T04:58Z,"@yamaruxninja, no, there is no offline mode available with blue burst...for that you have to download PSO PC Version 2.  And yes, you can make a shortcut to online.exe and play it from there.

also @eightbithero, what custom OGG pack are you talking about?  I thought that I uploaded just my regular install folder!"
,Tha-man,2009-02-23T12:10Z,SEEEED!!! its taking too long i cant w8 to get this! (im kinda phantasy star addicted)
,moviesurf,2009-06-27T12:25Z,seeds please. i promise to seed later after i dl
,johnnyfortner,2009-06-30T02:28Z,"come on seed, the more you seed the more people will play. im going to see when its done too"
,johnnyfortner,2009-06-30T06:08Z,"great torrent, im on vista and i made no changes to make this work, just click online, the start, works 100%"
,McLeprechaun,2009-10-09T18:45Z,Yet another desperate request for seeding from a major PSO fan whose previous server just went under... please?
,McLeprechaun,2009-10-09T18:48Z,"Oh, and yes, I will and am presently seeding as well... I just lack the whole file."
,teh_minneh,2009-11-14T08:53Z,"I'll be seeding for a while after i get it.

But it's getting to me pretty slow. :/"
,Pocowi,2010-02-24T21:56Z,When I click Online.exe after following ashasaur's instructions I get an error stating that a new socket cannot be created. I am running vista.
,4nd0r1n,2010-03-29T19:28Z,"Uploader: Good job, except that I wish you had distributed an unmodified copy of PSO. N-VH Forest is foggy for some reason, the Forest has different BGM, and there are a few pics in the bmp folder. Because of this I had to go with another installer."
,yamaruxninja,2010-05-02T02:04Z,Wont let me login anymore.. :( and I can't create a new account on the website either.
,dinothunder1024,2010-06-29T19:42Z,can't extract the file
,Zenxmetal,2011-02-11T23:04Z,Is there A way to play Offline??
,4skinn,2011-02-26T21:31Z,i can't get it working.. something about a 64 bit system and how it won't work on mine :(
,Mr_n_MrsDreadJonny,2011-03-04T15:12Z,"If you have any problem with this download after following the ""directions"" in the description go to the SCHTHACH page as listed by Fryx.... take a moment to look for all of the fixes in forums.  Downloaded and installed on Win 7 64. Works like a dream no viruses or trojans... win 7 seems to support whatever the game needs for in game typing,or Ashasaur may have included the fix without knowing/mentioning. The only problem i had in any way with this download was figuring out how to set it up. Damn computer illiterate here so if i can do it with google and a brassy pair everyone can........ I rate this download 10/10 for kicking ass from start to finish"
,Triggerhand,2011-03-18T00:00Z,"I had troubles installing this on my Win7 64bit laptop/computer. After some looking in to, go to this website
