,Catee,2008-03-04T04:23Z,Thanks!  These are hard to find....;o)
,Catee,2008-03-04T06:16Z,"Uh, Could You Seed it Please....Thanks Again!...;o)"
,Catee,2008-03-05T01:04Z,Got It!  Thanks!  I'll keep it queued for seeding for a good while so you can seed something else.  Come on leechers - if you want this torrent now is a good time to come and get it....;o)
,Catee,2008-03-13T22:26Z,"Excellent - a number of folks have taken advantage of having 2 seeders and downloaded this file!  I have now seeded to a ratio of 1:4 and there are 0 leechers left.  I will continue seeding through tomorrow evening (3-14) and then it's ixnay for me on this torrent and it's coming off my hard drive - unless there are downloaders.  Don't worry, I won't leave you hanging.  And there's always lythrode - the original poster - Thanks lythrode!

Toodles!"
,Catee,2008-03-15T23:13Z,"I've now seeded to a ratio of 1:6 and there are no more leechers left.  I am now removing this file off my hard drive.  If you want a seed you'll need to ask the original poster, lythrode.  Off to help seed others......"
