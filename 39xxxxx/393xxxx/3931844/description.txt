Description:

The people of the world are an audience to which the Illuminati entertain with propaganda. Just one of
the thousands of recent examples of this type of acting done for the public was President Bill Clintonâ??s
1995 State of the Union address. The speech was designed to push all of the warm fuzzy buttons of his
listening audience that he could. All the green lights for acceptance were systematically pushed by the
Presidentâ??s speech with the help of a controlled congressional audience. The truth on the other hand
doesnâ??t always tickle the ear and warm the ego of its listeners. The light of truth in this book will be
too bright for some people who will want to return to the safe comfort of their darkness.
