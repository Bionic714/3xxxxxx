,muzikphan,2008-02-13T16:47Z,"On a Mac you'll want to use ""Play"".

http://sbooth.org/Play

It can handle 'flac' files without any problems.

Many thanks ceddieboy."
,ceddieboy,2008-03-02T15:47Z,"There is also an XMMS plug-in that is related to the Fink project:

http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/flac-xmms

This information can be found in the links provided at the top of the page under ""How do I play a flac file?""

Thank you muzikphan for the quick and helpful response. I will add the Play link to my list of links with future Torrents for my MAC OS friends!"
,potsypotty,2009-03-30T13:37Z,"thanx but dude wtf with password zip.
cdboy is not a complete noob and so he must have his reasons for hiding torrent contents in a zip and his excusses about it being better simply dont make sense.
he has 3 torrents on tpb and on every one he gets flac (punn intended) in comments which he obviously ignores.
still its a free world and he has not a gun at my head so thanx cdboy but dude i not seed password zipped torrents nor will other experienced dl'ers = which is why your torrents are crawling. everyone loses.
