Pretty sure I've got DivX, but it won't play-seems like a VERY interesting bit of film & would love to view it-R.S.V.P."

Wanting some reference material on proper Japanese great/large sword techniques, any pertinent torrents/info would be great, as this weapon was fairly rare/usually toted by ranking/significant Samurai (very few were actually made, let alone used/practiced)...making research material very difficult to find-would appreciate any assistance greatly!"
