Gorgeous kaleidoscopic choreography from the amazing vision of Busby Berkeley.

His influence can still be seen in many pop videos to this day.  Check out Christina Aguilera's 'Come on Over' and Take That's 'Shine' for good examples.

From Wikipedia:

Busby Berkeley (November 29, 1895 ? March 14, 1976), born William Berkeley Enos in Los Angeles, California, was a highly influential Hollywood movie director and musical choreographer.

Berkeley was famous for his elaborate musical production numbers that often involved complex geometric patterns. Berkeley's quintessential works used legions of showgirls and props as fantastic elements in kaleidoscopic on-screen performances. He started as a theatrical director, just as many other movie directors. Unlike many at the time, he felt that a camera should be allowed mobility, and he framed shots carefully from unusual angles to allow movie audiences to see things from perspectives that the theatrical stage never could provide. This is why he played an enormous role in establishing the movie musical as a category in its own right.
