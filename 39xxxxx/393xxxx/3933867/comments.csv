I hope you will too after finishing your download, thnx"
,Jadocs,2007-12-14T23:12Z,Whats the quality like?
,carolinawolf,2007-12-14T23:42Z,are the subs hardcoded?
,Italian_Banker,2007-12-15T00:07Z,"probably hardcoded, the DL is a single .avi file, no .srt. im more concerned with it being a cam again."
,Punkpik,2007-12-15T01:16Z,Yeah does anybody know a website where you can download true dvdrips/dvds from the newest movies? It would be appreciated ^^.
,Labwrath,2007-12-15T07:10Z,"If you're talking about dvdrips of movies still in theater, good luck with that.lol  You can find dvdrips of almost any movies just released on dvd on every torrent site."
,Labwrath,2007-12-15T07:12Z,Sometimes you might find a dvd screener.
,odinstorm,2007-12-15T08:07Z,This looks like it is the Stuffies version with hard coded subs.
,katapult_2007,2007-12-15T08:34Z,Subs are HARDCODED
,flipyens1,2007-12-15T11:43Z,"hows the quality and audio? (1-10, 1 cam - 10 dvd) ^^"
,katapult_2007,2007-12-15T12:51Z,"It's a Cam, but for a Cam it's a reasonable quality, I would say a 6"
,babslabush,2007-12-16T17:35Z,mercikes voor de upload :)
,cyrekzz,2007-12-16T18:06Z,yeah looks like the same version as: The Golden Compass v2 NEW SOURCE CAM XVID (R5 Vid Quality) because it zooms in to get rid of the subs at the same place in both. I like the quality in the other one - looks like they ran it through some filters to sharpen the picture.. or something like that.
,jeroen68,2007-12-18T15:12Z,100.000 seeders en er gebeurt nietssssssssssssss
,katapult_2007,2007-12-18T19:48Z,"Volgens mijn client zijn er voldoende seeders en leechers, maar ik moet wel zeggen dat ie zeer zeer traag op gang kwam, ik dacht eerst dat er helemaal niets gebeurde!!
Aan de andere kant kan de uploader natuurlijk niet weken blijven seeden als er al duizenden complete downloads zijn, Sorry"
,stephenrocky,2007-12-23T04:25Z,"has anyone got a good quality( not cam not fake) copy of this film or not, let us know."
,GoYanks,2008-01-11T17:52Z,"It is ridiculous that this movie got so much attention. Does no one see that this world is going down in flames. No one should download this movie. Plus the guy who wrote this says he is an athiest, well if athiest dont believe in Christ or the devil then why would he symbolize a child killing God at the end? He does believe and he is just a soul crying out for help. I am praying for all of the lost souls out there. Let God in! He loves you and wants you to enter his kingdom."
