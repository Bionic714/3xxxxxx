,monkery,2011-08-17T23:49Z,"Some people are ungrateful fuckwads. If you don't want a fucking zip, don't download the fucking thing. It's FREE motherfucker. Shut the fuck up and toss out the shit you don't want.

Now go cry to your mommy.

Thanks for the upload ErikBJ, and don't listen to these fucknuts. They're probably just leeches anyway."
