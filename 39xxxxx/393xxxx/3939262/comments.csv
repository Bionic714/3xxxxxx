thanks

,bl3s5in,2008-01-03T18:39Z,Great torrent. Worked on my MacBook using low settings and a low res. Currently seeding at 600kbps up.
,chani7,2008-01-07T14:25Z,"@megalothon & nerdynerd: This problem occurs when the system language is not english. Quake wnat's to use the correct languageparts, but they're not included so all it puts out is rubbish. Just set the system language to english, start Quake again and you can read everything.

In this moment I'm trying to install the official 1.4.2 Update in german and patch it. If it works I'll report here.
"
,chani7,2008-01-07T17:15Z,"Okay, here's the easy way for the ""#str_104305""-problem. Just rename the directory ""english"" in the ""quake 4""-folder to the actual system language (in my case it's ""german""). After that you have an working english version.

Installing the german 1.4.2 worked after a few twekas, but I wasn't able to patch it (patching the english 1.4.2. update worked, but the quake 4 in this torrent is already 1.4.2, which means there is no need to patch it)."
,nerdynerd,2008-01-07T19:03Z,"Yeah, works FINE, good idea with the language !
now I can frag ..."

,Xenon974,2008-02-13T16:44Z,"Hi,
I was having the #str problem and renaming the english folder doesn't help on my french system.
But as the application is localized in 3 languages (US, FR, GER) you can enable/disable them by right clicking the Quake4.app then Show Information and look in the language section, I uncheck all but english  and it works fine now"
,Miran999,2008-02-24T14:23Z,"Hmm, Malutemol's codes worked well. Now I have completed the game, but when I try to join online games, it asks for CD-key again, and it says that my CD-key is invalid. Strange, isn't it?
Does anyone have the same problem? Or a valid key? :):)"
