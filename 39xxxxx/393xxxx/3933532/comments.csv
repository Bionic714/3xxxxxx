I thought [k] meant that we didn't need the serial. Looks like a very interesting app. Thanks for sharing this with us."
,hockpooh,2007-12-17T03:09Z,The serial in SerialBox worked but there was none in KCNscrew
,csar_of_sitar,2007-12-25T08:43Z,"The serial should work with the PC version, yes? I used Transmac to read the DMG file in a vain attempt to figure out the serial, but Transmac couldn't identify the file tree in the image-- I ended up sifting through many small files but with no luck.

Could someone please post the serial on its own? The serial I was using for previous versions no longer works. Thanks."
,hugoafsilva,2008-01-06T20:22Z,where is the serialbox? what is the serialbox? what is the key? 
,danibo,2008-02-17T01:44Z,"SerialBox is a program containing serials for lots of programs. Either it comes with this file, or you'll have to search google for it. (or piratebay)"
,sgu,2008-05-27T00:17Z,"Can someone please provide a working serial for this version?

The one supplied in serialbox is for version 4.3.5.

Many thanks!"

For those who don't / are lazy - I made this one up just for you:

Name: Bob Marley
Department: Photos
S/N: 4881188056

Have fun!!"
