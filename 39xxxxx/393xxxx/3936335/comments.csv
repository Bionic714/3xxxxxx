,limbr0,2007-12-27T04:11Z,"firstly, thank you anous for all your considerable contributions to the torrent scene. to hackNcrack & bsilver87: is there really any need to use profanity when addressing the other humans? it's very dissapointing to see you both begin sentences with a swear word. the world is in a period of change. when we finally arrive at the eventual future business model, it will probably mean that everyone can buy things cheaply for a fair price electronically. currently china seems to lead the way with piracy because they cannot afford western prices. it is our duty to torrent to bring about these changes. just as the ipod changed the way music is sold, so to will torrents change the way intellectual property is distributed. sadly the current business model means that when I pay for an album, very little of that money goes to the artist. Radiohead deserves credit for their efforts towards freeing artists of the ""old model"" which according to artists, stifles creativity. it's well known that the beatles and elvis received around one cent from each dollars they earned at their peak. I for one have no desire to ""reward"" the artist under the current business model given that most of the money goes into the pockets of overpaid executives and countless middlemen. the old business model is also killing the planet by wasting resources. there is simply no need to make plastic covers and CD's and waste all that paper when the only purpose these containers serve is to line the pockets of the selfish status quo. happy new year!"

,ANicki_InTheUk,2008-01-21T22:04Z,"talking about saviours of hip hop, please take the time to check out 'immortal technique' this puerto rican rapper is amazing but will not sign to any corporate record label so you MUST download if you want a taste. I don't know how to post links but if you searc on thi site there's a discography package, or if you're hesitant look for album called 'Revolutionary Volume 2'.

Cheers Anous!"

,ratcfc,2008-01-24T13:04Z,"I appreciate the toreents people, but we should be honest about what we are doing. While the recording industry is unfair to most artists, we can't (or alt least most ouf cant) pretend that we are downloading this music faor a just cause. Most of us are downloading because its free, Case in point is Radiohead In Ranbows.....they broke the mold and certainly did sell many albums, the ratio of legal downloading to illegal was like 1:4. We need to be honest with ourselves. "
,youaintseenme,2008-01-25T19:28Z,Thank You.
,stafman,2008-02-05T08:09Z,Thank You :)
,loopditroop,2008-02-07T19:05Z,"exactly,if no one buys,this is going to be his last album....every fu**er who downloads this album should keep that in mind"
,moblati461,2008-02-15T11:58Z,"Of course musicians nowadays do not make what they deserve and the majority of the money goes to rich execs that just sit around all day. But you should still buy his album if you support this dude, Lupe is straight sick.

Also to whoever mentioned immortal technique, Big up to you. Yall should definitely check out tech's stuff. Revolutionary music. "
,flux976,2008-03-09T08:35Z,"Ok you all simmer down now!

Are any of you that are complaining about buying the cd downloading any programs, movies, books ect from TPB? If not then what are you downloading, and what are you doing here? 

If you answered yes to that first question and you were complaining, your an idiot and go ahead and STFU! 

If not then what the hell are you doing here registered on TPB and posting useless comments for exactly?"

,redthread,2008-11-20T20:34Z,"I downloaded this torrent and enjoyed it (thanks anous) but all i can say is watch out, my internet service found out that i downloaded 'Free Chilly' (second track) and threatened to cancel my broadband connection. So make sure you guys have Peer Guardian or something!
