,stylishirish,2007-12-22T13:48Z,i heard rumors that axxo was sent to prison... but after just a few short weeks he was ripping movies inside the prison and somehow uploading them through the prison computer system... and then i heard that he escaped...and was caught again - but only after an intense gunbattle.... and then most recently that he had escaped again...so.... you never know

,Bark_Meow,2007-12-24T19:31Z,"This is an excellent film. Crononberg is great film maker. A new classic in Mafia genre.

I had no problem downloading and have already seeded 140% in couple of days.

This is first film I screened on my new 22""W monitor and looks fantastic in fullscreen. Thanks team - your files are always well made.

There is only a couple scenes of length in Russian (I kinda wished there were subs) but you can understand what is happening. And it    adds to the authentic feel of being inside the Russian mob.     "

... I'm really confused, does this film need / have subs??.. as there is a lot of Russian dialogue in the film and I've been left with the feeling that it kinda needs them!.. if anyone knows where to get some subs for the Russian spoken parts it would be much appreciated!

Thanks FXG Team for another wonderful upload!"

,PLP2Pguard,2008-03-02T11:01Z,"==spacecoyote==
answer is simple: because you don't protect yourself by using PeerGuardian and/or TOR."
,PLP2Pguard,2008-03-02T11:10Z,WARNNING to everybody ! Don't go to the web page www.all4divx.com. ==alexey12== is  proposing subtitles for movies but this page is blocked by PeerGuardin as CoreExpress (64.69.34.i119) so it can be risky..
,spacecoyote,2008-03-05T01:44Z,To PLP2Pguard : thanx a bunch kinda new to all this Tor works for me but PeerGuardian  is not supported by vista YET thanx again. happy pirating
,bossnz,2008-03-17T18:46Z,Looks like good quality...  Why when I try to put it onto DVD using Nero Vision does it not work.  Keep closing down before it gets to finish.  Happens with most FXG movies.
,feckinmuppet,2008-03-18T15:55Z,"Just a note, the codec for this avi is different to other FXG releases (XviD ISO MPEG-4 instead of XviD 1.0.3 or XviD 1.1.0 Final) and will NOT play on PS3. Plays fine on pc tho. Quality of video and audio are fine like other FXG releases"
,spacecoyote,2008-03-18T23:51Z,to wwwired you are wrong your ip can be tracked  do a little research before you go running your mouth about something you know nothing about
,scannerfm77,2008-03-25T16:21Z,Thanks FXG. Your release always awesome!
,doubledge,2008-04-10T09:47Z,"===wwwired===, 
If you bittorrent client is uploading while downloading (as most do), your ip address is visible, just like all the ip address of the folks your downloading from, and connected to. Unfortunatly, if you turn off your upload rate, you can't download for shite - (wouldn't be too friendly with the P2P community, either!)
