I live in Oregon. I make music in my room. I sing in the shower!

Cantiwi and Teolio were originally two EPs, but I combined them into one coherent collection. Cantiwi is my earlier work, while Teolio was made a few months later when I had a better grasp on how to handle my 8-Track.

Please, enjoy! 



THIS IS A COLLECTIVE FAMILY RELEASE!
