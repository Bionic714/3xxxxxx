,Caribbeancoladas,2007-12-17T18:34Z,"That was the beauty of Ax's files. You knew all the information you wanted. Not by clicking on links and have more cookies in your compu then you can eat with a cup of tea. Still highly appreciating all the work ANY uploader does, Caribbeangreetings,"

,The_13th_4postle,2007-12-18T03:11Z,"This movie is terrible, this makes Kill Bill look like a realistic movie.  "
,Art_Vendelay,2007-12-18T03:56Z,"hey 13th 4postle u don't know shit.  this movie is awesome unless ur a pussy who doesn't like guns.  c'mon he delivers a baby while in a shoot out, & the sex scence/shoot out was awesome.  yeah its completley unrealistic but its a movie"
,stylishirish,2007-12-18T08:08Z,"the movie is terrible, yes... but it is so terrible that it is good... make sense? 

the sad parts are funny... the serious parts are sad... and the funny parts - well they are really horrible... but there are enough gunshots, ridiculous and silly sex scenes to make it fun.

and its all for the sake of a precious little baby!

the quality is the same as any axxo torrent ever was"
