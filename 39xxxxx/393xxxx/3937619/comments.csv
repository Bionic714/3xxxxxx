,DeathByJayJay,2007-12-18T19:05Z,"When RDCmrT grows some damn pubic hair maybe he'll stop being such a little prick to people who choose to upload files so that other people can share them, so that little faggots like him don't have to pay! 

This is why I only upload elsewhere, in more private, POLITE and appreciative communities. Not a community full of pre-pubescent little stuck up idiots. 

You want the damn game? 

BUY IT."

,DeathByJayJay,2007-12-21T04:47Z,Right try extracting the files with powerISO or ISO buster or whatever and then just click on the GTA III.exe and play. I'm taking it you didn't follow the instructions LOL but yer if that doesn't work just post on here again.
,adik2004,2007-12-22T19:01Z,"doesn't work. winrar won't extract it, daemon tools won't mount it, poweriso won't mount or extract it, neither will iso buster. anyone had any success with this file?"

Recently downloaded one and I just can't express how fucking annoyed I was when I found out the stupid shit that uploaded the game didn't have the radio stations in it.
