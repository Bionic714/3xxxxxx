54 complete broadcasts and 16 partial broadcasts of the much beloved, but now cancelled CBC Radio 2 programme Brave New Waves. Episodes span from November 28, 2006 to the final broadcast on March 16 2007. Each complete broadcast consists of a one hour portion with live guest DJ's Helen Spitzer or Joshua Carpati followed by three hours of "The Best of Brave New Waves" pre-recorded with the traditional host Patti Schmidt. 

The files were ripped directly from the live CBC Radio 2 Toronto stream (i.e., don't blame me for the format or quality) with

mplayer -playlist http://origin.www.cbc.ca/mrl2/livemedia/cbcr2-toronto.asx -dumpstream -dumpfile $date.wma

and subsequently "repaired" to allow seeking with the "Lost Chunks" facility of AsfTools3.1.

Should you wish to convert them to mp3, you might try 

mplayer $date.wma -ao pcm:file=$date.wav
lame --preset standard $date.wav $date.mp3

This will however increase the file size and probably add further lossyness, hence why they are still in this atrocious format.

If others have old recordings of the show, please upload!
