Sorry about the quality.  The original is a lower quality VCD.  I used Nero to transcode and MicroTorrent to make the torrent.  Best viewed with VLC.

Spoken language is Thai with some english and subtitles in Chinese(?)  Of course, you are not really interested in what they are saying, just the eye candy.

Of interest only to those who have been to, or want to go to Thailand.

Not the Cabaret show, but rather one of the earlier Miss Alcazar videos from 1997.  This is disk 2 of a 2-disk set.

You already know that Thailand has three genders.  Male, Female and Other.  This video is about a beauty pageant for the other gender (ladyboy).  Not to be confused with the Shemale who is a separate, western invention - the ladyboy is in a class by herself.

If you have not already done so, then please visit wikipedia concerning "katoey" for a fuller explanation. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathoey)

In Pattaya Thailand, there are 2 competing Ladyboy Cabaret shows.  Both are equally grand and both are very well attended.  My personal favourite is Alcazar but Tiffany's is a close competitor.  By all means bring your family if you want to since they are family-friendly.  If you are a single male, wait by the outer doors after the show and meet (or date for $) the stars.

Be careful after the show with the picture taking charges at Tiffany's.  They will charge you for any photos you take with a performer.  Take note that they charge by the performer and many will try to jump into your photo to get the extra baht per person charge.  

Alcazar was free the last time I was there (2006). If you go to Alcazar - say hello to Wawa and Lyn for me...

The most beautiful women on earth are indeed the ladyboys of Thailand.

Featuring the obiquitous ladyboy hag as the stand-up comic and MC.  Typical Thai humour.
