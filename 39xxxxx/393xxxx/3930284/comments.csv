,Ninjorp,2007-12-12T07:12Z,Anything I can do for you? Do you want a What.cd invite?
,Ninjorp,2007-12-13T13:25Z,"Shuffler, can you seed up the Jim Marrs Aztec conference? I'm stuck at 98.5%"
,shuffler,2007-12-15T05:17Z,"Hey Ninjorp... 

I'm sure TPB used to have a messaging system - can't find it now.

Anway - I haven't seeded Aztec for ages - I'll have a look. I have piles of UFO/exopolitics shit !

Do you have a list - then we can swap some by mail or online... that goes for anyone else - exo.pol@gmail.com"
