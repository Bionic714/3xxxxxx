L Animal is a 1977 movie in French AKA "Stuntwoman", according to IMDB; and 'The Animal'. It Stars Raquel Welch in her physical prime. We get to see Welch seethrough black lingerie without a bra on and a wet clingy seethrough leopard-print dress seeminly without any underwear at all on. And the movie looks to be funny enough to watch even if one doesn't understand the dialogue. I couldn't find an English version, so I bought this and ripped it because of the incomparable Raquel Welch's prominent appearance in it, not to mention an exceedingly rare glimpse of her in seethrough clothing - RUBrTOE

IMDB link since PB has taken to only allowing the code at the end of the link: 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075683/
I don't understand this because people were bitching  about my first downloads when all I included in the "IMDB ID" space was the IMDB 9-digit id of the movie  per PB instructions. 
So then I started putting the whole link up there. But PB dissallows it now, only allowing the 9-digit IMDB movie ID, which I put up in the beginning and got bitched at for in comments in my torrents. 
The complaints ranged from 'How hard hard is it to put the entire IMDB link up so we can just click on it, to " I clciked on the IMDB link for this movie and it doesn't work."

So, to all you stupid assholes who criticized me in the beginning for using only the 9-digit IMDB movie ID: I was right, you were wrong and you all are fucking idiots! - RUBrTOE
