Circle of Allusions was recorded in the basement of my Urbana, IL birth home on a reel to reel four track during a week of August 2007. It is a debut solo album and being as such I wrote, performed and recorded everything with the exception of my dad's piano on "Furniture".

A self release of perhaps 100, so far, have been handed out, hand signed and doodled upon. 


THIS IS A COLLECTIVE FAMILY RELEASE!
