[T],doktor_zook,2007-12-13T19:47Z,"This television documentary investigates mummies found in the Takla Makan Desert of Asia, who are clearly not from China. The mummies date back as far as 3,800 years, which pre-dates what was thought to be the arrival of Westerners to China. Because the Chinese government insists that China was free from Western influence until at least 1000 B.C., these mummies, who appear to be European, represent a threat to those claims. Therefore, the expedition team that goes to view an ancient burial site with a Chinese archaeologist is constantly accompanied by two Chinese officials. However, in the interest of international cooperation, they do allow the team to dig up a grave. Some of the more important evidence they find is actually already in museums in China, though the Chinese lack the funds to preserve these mummies properly.
