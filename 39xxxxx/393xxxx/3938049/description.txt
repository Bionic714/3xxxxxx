A super session from the ex-Traffic percussionist-songwriter

this amazing album features the late George Harrison, Traffic cohort Stevie Winwood, Deep Purple's Ian Paice, Style Council/Jam's Paul Weller, & blues-rock Thin Lizzy guitarist Gary Moore.

What else can be said....I've included scanned cover art


please continue to seed so others can get this just like you

comments welcome

cheers GazzJazz
