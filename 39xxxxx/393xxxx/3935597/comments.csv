,EIHO1966,2008-01-07T23:11Z,The Keygen is Worm infected
,gm12345678,2008-01-08T14:41Z,"EIHO1966, when I saw your comment, I went back and scanned the keygen again, and I got the same warning you probably got (from Symantec).  The thing is, when I scanned the keygen about 3 weeks ago, I got no such warning.  I have a hunch that Symantec's updated signature files are giving a false positive, but of course I can't prove it.  However, I ran this keygen twice when I originally installed this program, yet my system shows none of the signs (registry entries or files) that Symantec says indicate an infection of the type it is claiming.  Plus, my firewall never warned of any outgoing connections for this worm.

My only interest in this is that my own torrent for the ""Universal Restore"" addon (see my comment above) uses the very same CORE keygen (same hash), which I obtained from a completely different source.  All of this leads me to conclude that this is probably a false positive, but careful users can always run the keygen in a virtual machine as a safeguard, because it still delivers working serials for the Acronis programs.  Cheers."
