seeding till ratio 3:1"
,NeverEnuf80,2009-01-12T09:17Z,"Why on earth would anyone use anything but the standard zip or rar for this? FLACs and compressed things do not compress any further (you might get a few KB); the zip/rar is just to package it for an easy download.

This is clearly some kind of scam. Don't start downloading this dirty swine's program that he/she's used to ""zip"" it when there's 2 very strong standards already.

To everyone for whom this isn't obvious, THE ONLY REASON TO USE SOME STRANGE NO-NAME COMPRESSION SOFTWARE WOULD BE TO ADD SOFTWARE TO YOUR COMPUTER!!

This is the same BS as those who trick the dumb into downloading some bizarre new codec to play a video file when mpeg4 universally works great for everything.
Don't be fooled, or you deserve to get your computer screwed over. The uploader is one of those pathetic loaner choads (probably with a Honda/Mitsubishi/Subaru/VW with giant ebay exhaust and/or spoiler) that hates the world since they went to the prom with their uncle's kid...or something along those lines.

Again...the only reasons anyone would use something other than zip or rar is to infect you. Duh"
,ceddieboy,2009-01-19T00:18Z,"Thanks for killing my seed dude (NeverEnuf80)!  I don't need to hack or infect any ones computer. Check my history, all my files are done this way.  the reason I compress to Lossless files with RAR is simple,

1) I want to insure that if any of the audio tracks have lost any integrity I want the listener to know before they even listen to the the them.  I'm an audio file and it is important to me that what I offer is as close to the source as possible.

2)  I want more people to use flac and RAR formats because I feel their respective developers are the best at what they do.  

Anyway, if you want to believe this is infected then simply run the files through one or more anti-virus / malware apps. Duh! I recommend and use Kaspersky 2009.

*Since I have gotten a lot of push back about the compression to RAR my future audio seeds will only contain flac files.

Enjoy,

,potsypotty,2009-03-30T13:38Z,"thanx but dude wtf with password zip.
cdboy is not a complete noob and so he must have his reasons for hiding torrent contents in a zip and his excusses about it being better simply dont make sense.
he has 3 torrents on tpb and on every one he gets flac (punn intended) in comments which he obviously ignores.
still its a free world and he has not a gun at my head so thanx cdboy but dude i not seed password zipped torrents nor will other experienced dl'ers = which is why your torrents are crawling. everyone loses.
