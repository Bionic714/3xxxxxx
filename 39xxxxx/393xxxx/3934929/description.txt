*THIS IS NOT A REMASTER BUT THE ORIGINAL PARLOPHONE VINYL AS IT WAS MEANT TO SOUND*

A Hard Days Night is the third album by The Beatles, released in the UK on 10 July 1964 as the soundtrack to their first film of the same name. 

Side one of the LP contains the songs from the movie soundtrack. Side two contains songs recorded for, but not included in, the film, although a 1980s rerelease of the movie includes a prologue before the opening credits with Ill Cry Instead on the soundtrack. This is also the first Beatles album to be recorded on four-track tape, allowing for good stereo mixes. Despite this, the CD of this album is currently available only in mono, though many of the tracks appeared in stereo on CD for the first time with the release of the boxset The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 in 2004.
