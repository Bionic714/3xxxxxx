Review by Stewart Mason, All Music Guide
 
Argentina-born, Spain-based new age composer Bruno Sanfilippo's 
ninth album starts unpromisingly, with a pair of tracks that fall too 
heavily into the clichÃ©s of his chosen style: the opening "Introworld" 
has a number of vaguely ethnic-sounding elements, from faux-tribal 
drums to sorta Native American-sounding flutes, all of them combining 
into a mushy, indistinct approximation of "world music" one would 
expect to hear playing in the background of a gift shop in downtown 
Santa Fe. Following that, the equally uninspired "Intromentel" (the 
incomprehensible semi-punning titles continue through the following five 
songs as well) is simply eight minutes' worth of droning/pealing synth 
lines: pretty enough, but nothing that hasn't been done repeatedly. 
After that, however, Intro develops nicely into a melodic, sonically 
varied slice of ambient new age comparable to Harold Budd and 
Virginia Astley. In particular, the two centerpiece tracks "Intropiano" 
and "Introvoices" (the latter of which sounds directly inspired by part 
two of Brian Eno's Music For Airports) are genuinely pretty without 
becoming merely saccharine. Skip the first quarter or so, and Intro 
has a relaxed, low-key appeal.
