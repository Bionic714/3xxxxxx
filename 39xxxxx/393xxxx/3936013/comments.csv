,grunberd,2008-01-04T17:50Z,can't toast the TS folder
,yomama07024,2008-01-04T23:58Z,Is this in English?
,RBG2,2008-01-05T09:05Z,"Yes it's in English (well, mostly. There's a bit in Russian here and there.)

Audio: Eng AC3 5.1
Subs: Eng, Spa, Fr
Eng = English
Spa = Spanish
Fr = French.
It seems that by removing the French audio and one of the extras, the result is a folder that fits on a DVD.  Good job, rahljens!

I was able to copy the folder of files directly to a DVD RW and play in my DVD player.
Step 1: download and seed.
Step 2: (under MacOS) Insert DVD RW and run the command (e.g. from Terminal):
drutil -drive 1 -ufs erase
Step 3: in the Finder, Drag VIDEO_TS folder onto the DVD icon.
Step 4: click burn icon."

THANX!"
,hoppkorv,2008-01-19T20:44Z,"Well, I've read the comments. 
1)Does the disc work or 
2)does it carry a virus?
3) What is this about ""drutil -drive 1 -ufs erase""?
Looks like something that will erase your hard drive.
4)I dl'd it and it won't burn on Toast because of CSS protection.

Summation: Try a different version"

No Problem."
