There is NOFIREWALL in it!!!
If you use it please install another firewall, or turn on windows firewall!"
,xazuma,2007-12-15T12:08Z,"never say   turn your windows firewall up
because............it's the worst that i have ever seen
chose a great firewall take that like note"
[T],botpet,2007-12-16T01:02Z,"Yes you all right! xD
I can suggest the comodo firewall, if you have enought memory in your computer."
,Dj Wout,2007-12-16T17:26Z,Never ever use windows firewalls. Use a separate Linux firewall. It wount slow down your windows box.
[T],botpet,2007-12-16T18:52Z,"What kind of firewall?
Linux seperate?
From where can I download that?"
,cryptic82,2007-12-18T06:41Z,"hey botpet, thanx for the upload, iv been looking for a clean version of this torrent. But if anybody can help, the word doc included in this torrent is encripted in something that looks like russian. i tried converting it with no luck. i don't know where to place the reg file which i guess is what the doc file tells us. i tried the program folder, i tried sys32 but it didnt work. if anybody knows can they please give an explanation on how to activate this please :)"
[T],botpet,2007-12-18T12:37Z,"The doc file is a changelist, not a readme file.Yes it is russian, you can open it with office word or open office org etc.Try to translate it by using dictionaries...
The setup wizard asked you to activate the program, you should choose activation by excisting liscence key.If you have not activated the program by the way before written klick with right mouse button on 'K' and choose activation.
Good luck!"

[T],botpet,2007-12-18T21:14Z,"Yes this is a beta key to 'beta' program, so it is only 30 days.
But I will upload new virsion with new keys."
