The Beatles
THE ULTIMATE "SESSIONS" COLLECTION (2CD)

Wow, there sure has been a lot of "Sessions" LP and CD releases for the past 20 years.  You could really go crazy trying to collect them all OR you could just download this 2CD set and get the most complete US/UK versions with the best sound quality.  The only thing this set is missing right now is the artwork...so (hint hint) I sure would appreciate some scans of that new Fake Apple 2LP set and/or some fancy new CD artwork for all the hard work I put into this set (LOTS of edits here...believe it or not).
