,Cash77,2008-02-07T08:22Z,"Works Fine and show updates if you do this.
download the latest version here http://www.versiontracker.com
then tjek drivers in trial mode then it shows it all......close the program and replace the original .exe with the crack from this torrent....then it works as it should :-)"

,bettym,2008-11-26T09:28Z,Great job people!Thanks!
,JakFrost,2009-02-12T19:41Z,Application and Patch work just fine and scan the system for existing drivers and applications but they will not inform you if they are out of date and need updates. This program is absolutely worthless without paying $29.95 USD for a yearly Subscription and Registering your e-mail in the program under Tools menu -> Options -> Registration Tab. Don't bother downloading it.
