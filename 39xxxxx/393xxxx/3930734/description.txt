The English masters of dark pop-romantics are BACK !              
"(Listen For) The Rag And Bone Man" takes the listener on a
dreamlike journey through dark landscapes populated by stray      
nursery rhyme characters, mysterious woman who peer into the      
psyche and pools of light that appear like reflections of their   
pastoral upbringing.
A policy of using 'real' instruments, including a double bass,    
zither and piano has resulted in a rich, organic sound colored
further by a guitar that brings to mind the trademark sound of
And Also The Trees' formative years.
