,golfpro,2007-12-13T19:14Z,I do take your point. But who actually reads manuals?

its the pirate bay not the freeware bay."
,golfpro,2007-12-14T16:31Z,"After having a play around with this, freeware is just about right (sorry developer if you're reading). No ones really going monies to pay for this. I've read up on it, installed it twice, and it still has problems. Maybe needs a bit more work. "
