The Egg - Nothing (Dusty Kid Loves Rock Remix 2007) [Progressive House]


My previous post of UNKLE's brand new remix of Dubfire's "I Feel Speed" has certainly got us in the mood for this track.

It's of the very same caliber and quality of production.  It's the very same sytle, sporting that excellent electro-rock fusion progressive and a fantastic male vocal.

This Dusty Kid remix is an all out essential, and will never die.

For those of you who may be unaware, Dusty Kid is an extremely well respected and emerging name that I am following vigorously and with absolute pleasure.  His highly commendable and diverse craft covers  the fields of Progressive, Electro, Clash, Tech House, Techno and Minimal... and he never disappoints.


If you missed this the first time round on my release schedule, be sure not to make the same mistake again.

Enjoy and please seed.
