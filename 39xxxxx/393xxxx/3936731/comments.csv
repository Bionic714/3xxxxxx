,FallingSin,2008-11-16T16:14Z,"Alright, this is about my forth or fifth time trying to download this. Sometime during downloading, there's always an error (using Vuze). Love this music, so I keep trying, it was a couple months ago since I last tried *cross fingers*"
,FallingSin,2008-11-16T17:55Z,"yup, there it goes. got to 14 percent before it said something about a flush fail and that some of the songs were being used by another program, which is ridiculous, I want even at my computer. Alas, I and X-ray dog were just not meant to be."
