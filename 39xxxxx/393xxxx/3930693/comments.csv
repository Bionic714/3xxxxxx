,hhworlds,2008-01-09T07:19Z,there is no audio file in the video files i checked for audio before burning because of the first comment.
,bigdadrr,2008-02-20T00:47Z,"Doesn't work using PowerDVD on the PC, Audio is lost after the menu and it plays at like double time.  Guess I'll burn it and try it on some other DVD players, but I wouldn't say it works on the vast majority of DVD players as described.  Thanks for the upload, even though."
,tr166a,2008-02-25T10:17Z,this only works with windows media player
,blacjoker,2008-05-29T15:35Z,"Even with WMP, I still got no audio."
,BloodLogic,2008-05-31T16:19Z,"Don't get excited, people -- this isn't the commercial DVD of The Boondocks. Just some TPB rips of it put into DVD. If you're looking for crisp, clean, quality versions of seasons 1 and 2 of the Boondocks, without the bulky and cumbersome DVD-file size, then download this other torrent.
