,dissoluto,2008-07-26T22:40Z,i can't find the apropriate subtitles that macht with this version of the film. 
,NancyKRoman,2008-11-24T01:26Z,"Video: XVID 512x384 29.97fps 1166Kbps 
Audio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz stereo 192Kbps 
Audio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448Kbps

A bit of a waste of bandwith on the audio, if you ask me, since the movie was recorded mono."
,DogNo7,2010-06-17T23:42Z,"The image has ""A Woman of Paris"" on the box refers to a tv feature that is not included in this.  This is only the feature film, A King in New York."
