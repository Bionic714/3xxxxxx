Difference from internal Windows XP data protection features

A lot of advanced users believe that Hide Folders XP (as well as any other third party folder protection software) is useless because Windows has integrated file and folder lock features.

Well, indeed, you can lock folders with Windows XP and this folder will be inaccessible by the other (unauthorized) users. But there are some annoying limitations that you should be aware of:

Windows allows you to lock files and folders on NTFS volumes only. FAT and FAT32 are not supported. Although nowadays it\'s too difficult to find a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) formatted with FAT, it\'s still in use in different removable storage devices. 
It is impossible to hide folder or file with standard Windows XP facilities. Only file and folder lock is possible. 
There is no way to make folder invisible but accessible which is helpful for different security tasks like logging, private data recording, backing up etc. 
A system administrator can easily get access to the locked folders and files. 
Windows XP home edition doesn\'t have a user interface to protect files and folders. 
There is no files and folders password protection in Windows XP (except the password you provide during Windows logon) - as soon as an authorized user authenticate himself by logging on, s/he get access to the protected files and folders. If you share your account with the another users then you can\'t exploit Windows folder protection features. 

New protection modes: Hide folder, Lock folder, Hide & Lock folder

If you are a Hide Folders XP 1.x user, you are probably know, that all hidden folders were inaccessible as well. So if you hide a folder with Hide Folders XP 1.x you also lock this folder. In Hide Folders XP 2.x this mode is called Hide & Lock. When you add a new folder to Hide Folders XP list, it will receive Hide & Lock protection attribute by default. 
There are 3 additional protection modes available in Hide Folders XP 2.x:

Hide folder protection mode. The protected file or folder will not be visible to a user, but it will be possible to access it if you know the path to the object. This can be helpful when you want to hide application folders but allow running the applications from these folders. E.g. you can hide Hide Folders XP application folder, so nobody will know about it, but if you type from the command prompt \"C:\\Program Files\\HFXP2\\hfxp.exe\", Hide Folders XP will run.

Lock folder protection mode. The protected file or folder will be visible but not accessible. It is similar to built-in protection of Windows NT-based operating systems on NTFS volumes. You cannot use this protection method for Windows, System and Hide Folders XP application folders.

No protection mode. If you choose this method, your file or folder will remain unprotected even if the protection is activated.
