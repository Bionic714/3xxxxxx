Description: This MPG has all the cut scenes of all 3 halo games put together as one long movie. i bought the Halo 3 Legendary Edition and i did not like how they made the DVD. in the Halo 3 Legendary Edition they had in game play with the cut scenes, which was a wast of time. also the quality of the Halo 3 Legendary Edition cut scenes where low quality. non of the Halo 3 Legendary Edition was used to make this MPG. i ripped all the cut scenes my self. when i put all the cut scenes together, i was surprize to see how well it came out. its like watching a movie not a game. the story runs smoothly. this MPG also has all halo3 cut scenes (and more) (Halo 3 Legendary Edition does not have that). if you are a HALO fan this is a must for you.

i spent a lot of time on this. i hope you enjoy it ---deathmule

HALO plot: After they crash-land on an artificial ring-world called "Halo", a navy captain, his surviving marines, and a genetically-and-surgically-enhanced supersoldier called "Master Chief" must find out what the Covenant, the genocidal alien race they are at war with, are looking for on the ring. However, Halo holds more secrets than either side imagined
