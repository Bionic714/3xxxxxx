,zerounu,2008-01-24T19:56Z,I recently discover the nr 1 antivirus on the world his name is SOPHOS .You maybe dont belive me but i am a security freak and this is the top security out there 1 Sophos (the most incredible AV ever created) 2.Kaspersky (Very good but very hard to configure properly) and on 3 HOW KNOWES? I heave been a NOD32 fan to but the Smart Security isn't so smart afterall been infected 2 times this year.So my opinion give it a try you can take from here for free and it s working more than GREAT http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3819809/Sophos_Antiv-Virus_v7.0_2007_XP_or_VISTA_32_amp_64bit-kNuLfiE
