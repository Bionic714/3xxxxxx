I looked everywhere for this, i missed after dark from the days of windows 3.1

Here it all is packaged into one.

Please read the readmes before using, or it won\'t work. 

Some of the individual screensavers don\'t work properly because of having too fast a CPU etc.

Do not let it modify your autoexec.bat win.ini etc when it asks, i don\'t trust an old dos program because it may corrupt something.

Enjoy!
