,captainwest,2008-06-13T05:05Z,"Hi guys, this is mainly addressed to JiiKoo but you will all benefit from reading it. The first 2 sessions of this Snooker torrent play fine but the final session cannot be played due to 'The Above File Name Is Invalid' coming up on to the screen. Unfortunately there does not seem to be a way to correct the problem due to no option being offered when you right click on the file. If you have a solution which will allow this file to be opened please post a reply here, I have a very good 2008 codec package on My Computers & I also use VLC Player here as well, thanks for the upload anyway m8 "
,Krattack,2008-08-08T22:46Z,"I looked at the invalid filename and not being able to rename the file. It seems to be because the complete filename, including the path is too long for XP. I got rid of it by copying the whole folder to the root of a drive and then renaming the files/folders."
,Michkin,2009-05-11T19:11Z," Solving this problem is quite simple. Rename the folders' names to make them smaller. I just erased the ""session maguire"" (leaving it Ronnie O'Sullivan vs Stephen 1) from the names and it worked.
Great quality, btw. Thanks."
