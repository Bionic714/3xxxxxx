This is Canvas 9 and X for Mac (Graphic \"swiss knife\")

everything tested and working fine, just ignore the warning for one .dmp (canvas 9.0) Serials are included.

DMG corrupt ?

The .dmg of canvas 9 may say it\'s corrupt, this is NOT true ! (My Mac screwed up or the CD was \"protected\")

I made this .dmg from Canvas 9 original CD and tried / installed both Canvas versions on a test machine without any problem. 

Please first the 9.0 version, enter the serial and then update to 9.0.4 with the provided updater.

Canvas X can be installed directly with this latest version (that\'s not even public, found on ACDsee\'s forum ;-))

Why ?

I made this two versions of Canvas available to everyone because I\'m really angry that ACDsee is letting the Mac community and it\'s long time customers down by not developping a version of Canvas for Intel machines.

Though, Canvas X is working perfectly fine on an Intel mac under Rosetta.

Latest news (not tested) says it\'s also working fine on Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard

I will soon BUY a retail copy of Canvas 11 for PC and make it available for all as a vengeance ! 

Make sure to check out the Pirate Bay for newer versions : http://thepiratebay.org/

Please let ACDsee know you\'re also angry by writing on the Mac section of ACDsee forum :
