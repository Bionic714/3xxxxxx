Do not worry if I stop seeding, I can't seed all day long... but my seed will resume late (around 22:00 central European time) and last almost all night long.

Seed may also be stopped if my tunnel fails, it WILL resume later for sure !

To ""avincent"" : shut up idiot, no one has completed a download...

Enjoy"

Please give me some feedback on the quality of my files.

If anything is wrong just pardon me, it was my first torrent upload...

I'll check here daily

Merry Christmas to all
