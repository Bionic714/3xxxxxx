,J.O.Gangsta,2007-12-20T12:37Z,How is the quality of this movie?
,stylishirish,2007-12-21T11:29Z,"its true --- black and white for a very brief bit here and there but it IS NOT enough to have made me even the slightest bit irritated... its not during any key or exciting parts so far as i remember - it is a true screener after all, and there is an insignia similar to the major networks in the lower right...but very very transparent

the quality is excellent - both a/v

the movie is pretty intense and pretty well acted"
