A collection of instrumentals composed by James Eric, compiled from 2000-2007.

Featured are movie scores for indie films soon to be released, experiments done during spurts of insomnia, as well as odes to ambient favorites. Influences range from Jon Brion to Brian Eno.

This is a side of me that I rarely represent live, so it's a rare treat to share this with anyone who wants to listen to something completely different, without words or vocals.


THIS IS A COLLECTIVE FAMILY RELEASE!
