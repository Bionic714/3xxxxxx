HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!"
,desu_,2008-05-20T10:18Z,"Works great, it is in english and does not contain any virus. Just extract the img with poweriso and install, the cdkey is on the image.
You are not witty by talking bullshit, read the comments that are valueable and thank the uploader like it should be.
Thanx aturs_3001"
,dmale,2008-05-20T20:08Z,"99 % av alla komprimerade filer som tankas hem går att mounta med Deamon Tools (som ju alla använder). Så varför i h-lvete ska man behöva ta hem ytterligare ett program (poweriso) bara för att installera EN applikation!? Den här filen går i papperskorgen, jag hittar en annan istället. Tack så j-vla mycket puckon."
