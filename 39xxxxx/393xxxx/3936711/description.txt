Hey all. Uploaded my first little cd here. 

from http://www.purevolume.com/bananabread: Big head-filling grooves laced with crispy crunchy beats, string sections, delicious basslines, some old pianos, and topped with synths... Mostly mellow, for background or foreground. Stick with it, it gets good. 
Thanks for your ear-time!
