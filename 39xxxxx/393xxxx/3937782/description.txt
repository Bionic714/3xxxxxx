Re-post.



For those who may have missed this essential release last time round on my release schedule before Demonoid went down, here is another absolutely excellent and more recent Police mashup by Dirty South.


Re-posts and reconstruction of my release schedule will be complete by new year, from which time, only the very latest releases covering the entire spectrum of house and techno will be posted.

Don't forget to check for any other Dirty South titles and remixes you may be missing on the schedule.




Enjoy and please seed.
