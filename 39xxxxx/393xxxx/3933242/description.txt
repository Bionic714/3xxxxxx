The multi-award-winning documentary of Tibet. If you're all mushy for China, you shouldn't watch it, because there's some annoying history in amongst all the gorgeous scenery and local customs.

100% lossless conversion of DVD9 to two DVD5 with menus intact. (I did take the liberty of removing warnings and some non-related trailers.)
