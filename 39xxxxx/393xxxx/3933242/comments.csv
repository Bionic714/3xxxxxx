The Chinese media has been silent on the situation in Tibet. In their daily
briefings, spokespersons of the Chinese Foreign Office have admitted some
protest demonstrations by the Buddhist monks in Lhasa, but have played down
the gravity of the situation and have projected it as under control.

2. The only details to the contrary are coming from the CIA-funded Radio
Free Asia, foreign diplomats in Beijing, foreign tourists caught up in
Tibet, the offices of the Dalai Lama in different parts of the world and the
Tibetan diaspora in India and the West. The Chinese have not yet been able
to block the Internet as effectively as the Myanmar military junta did when
the monks and students staged protest demonstrations in Myanmar last year.
As a result, one has been able to get a regular flow of information till the
time of writing of this article (10 PM Indian Standard Time on March 14,
2008).

3. After allowing for some exaggeration and rumour-mongering in these
reports, it is clear that the Chinese military are facing a revolt in Tibet
the like of which Tibet has not seen since the Khampa revolt of the 1950s,
which was ultimately crushed by the military. Initially, the trouble started
with slogan-shouting demonstrations by the monks of three monasteries in
Lhasa. They were peaceful and avoided violence. Repeated attempts by them to
march in procession were prevented by the police----initially with the use
of batons only and subsequently by using tear smoke. On the first three days
(March 10, 11 and 12), the protests were confined to the monks, with the
general population showing little interest.

4. From March 13, 2008, sections of the general population of Lhasa,
particularly the youth, have joined the protests. Some have been
demonstrating on their own separately. Some have joined the demonstrating
monks. After the youth came out into the streets, the demonstrations took an
increasingly violent turn with targeted attacks on members of the Chinese
security forces and Han settlers from outside Tibet. Some Tibetans, who were
working for the Government, have deserted their posts and joined the
demonstrators. Some Tibetans working in the Police have also deserted their
jobs and joined the demonstrations.

5. While the Lhasa Police, which has a mix of Hans and Tibetans, kept its
cool and avoided using excessive force, Chinese army units, which consist
mostly of Hans, lost their cool and opened fire on the demonstrators twice,
resulting in at least two deaths. This infuriated the local people. More
Tibetans joined the demonstrations and set fire to at least three military
vehicles.

6. Initially, the monks were merely shouting slogans praising the Dalai Lama
and calling for the independence of Tibet. The youth, who joined
subsequently, shouted slogans against the railway line to Lhasa alleging
that it was constructed with forced Tibetan labour and that many of them
were killed during the construction. They were also demanding the release of
the Panchen Lama designated by the Dalai Lama in accordance with the Tibetan
traditions. He has been arrested by the Chinese authorities and replaced by
a nominee of the Communist Party.

7. Most of the demonstrators have left the streets at the time of the
writing of this report. Lhasa is relatively calm and the streets are
deserted but for the security forces, who are patrolling intensely.It
remains to be seen whether they demonstrate again tomorrow.

8. News of the firing incidents in Lhasa and the deaths have resulted in
protest demonstrations in the rural areas too. The trouble is spreading from
Lhasa to the interior areas.

9. The Chinese have been totally taken by surprise and highly embarrassed.
During the last one year or more, they had sponsored the visits of many
foreign journalists, including from India, to Tibet by the newly-constructed
railway line. Some of these journalists duly impressed by what they were
shown painted an idyllic picture of Tibet under t"
