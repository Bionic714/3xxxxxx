,lee_1892,2007-12-17T10:42Z,yet another faultless quality download by mixermusic. i just watched movie excellent many thanks
,kongdvd,2007-12-17T17:08Z,"Good movie. 

Video quality: 9
Audio quality: 6 (mono) a bit thin sounding."
,michaelrwatson,2007-12-18T04:20Z,"Hmm.... by ""thin sounding"", i think kongdvd is trying to describe the awful hollowness and artifacting that's present in some parts of the movie, as if it was recompressed, then recompressed again a few times. 

Too bad. The video is good, but such strange, icky audio..... i'll wait for DVDrip."
,hydro4life,2007-12-19T21:37Z,nothing personel but the movie sucked and the quality wus not to good..but i still could watch the film so thanks..
,michaelrwatson,2007-12-20T03:21Z,"Update:  very watchable, although the audio is iffy in parts. thanks, hls."

The movie is propaganda nonsense.

,formidible,2008-02-07T22:42Z,If the sound is not good then it's NOT a DVD rip but a glorified cam job.
