,Posthumous,2008-06-11T06:07Z,"Someone tell me why the audio is so low that I can hardly hear it?  Even at full volume.  I've had this problem with other movies, as well.  Thanks in advance."
,Grayson_Burrows,2008-07-04T00:17Z,You have to switch to stereo in your movie player's and/or PC's audio settings instead of 5.1. When you playback 5.1 but only use 2 speakers the volume might be low.

Print Quality - Absolutely Good. I watch it on my WD so needn't change the 5.1 stereo setting etc.
About Movie - This movie is sort of a puzzle which you muct try to decipher at the end (atleast a little) depending upon how well you have observed every frame , especially the very first frame after the credits. Watch the movie and enjoy.
Nude Scenes - Class. I like Naomi Watts...So there!.
Thanks for this print."
