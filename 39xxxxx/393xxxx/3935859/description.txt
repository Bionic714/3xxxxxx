Movie star Teddy (Eric Tsang) made a career out of playing Casanova, but lately he's been down on work and cash. To help pay the bills, his assistant Wendy (Jo Koo) finds five desperate guys who are willing to pay to learn girl-chasing skills from the master. Adding to the full house is Teddy's long-lost daughter Pearl (Natalie Meng), who shows up at the doorstep and attracts the unwanted attentions of smarmy actor Rocky (Nat Chan). Teddy and Rocky have a rivalry that goes back many moons, and hijinks ensue when they get cast in the same movie. Rocky may have the upperhand, but Teddy and his five disciples have some pranks of their own to cook up.
