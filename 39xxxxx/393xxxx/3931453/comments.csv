thanx again!"
[T],cdomeij,2007-12-14T02:21Z,"No from one side you are right -

could very much have been like that.

Anyway...there is 3 chapters to each disc
1-3. Disc 4,  2 chapters. Disc 5, 1 chapter + epilouge. Disc 6 Special Features

The first rel was 13 chapters + epilouge = 14 parts. Made 2 chaps , 7discs. and no SP.features

Yes I was like that. Due to quality , ( you know that story about the restaration...its the same quality..they did a good job but its far from perfect, so I uderstand why they squizzed it."
