,Stinkyfanooter,2011-03-29T04:13Z,"Badass game from my yesteryears hahah,
to play you can mount it and go from there.
I suggest Daemon Tools Lite to do this it works like a charm"
,Joypad,2011-04-16T06:37Z,"Okay, I'm confused. I downloaded it. obviously tried to play it. but then it says 'No CD present'. I have tried a couple of no cd cracks but none of them work. what should I do?"
,m48b123,2011-06-07T01:22Z,"Does not work. No cd error, no crack."
,m48b123,2011-06-07T01:34Z,"Alright I got it working. Because all the morons before me including the f*g who uploaded this didn't want to explain, I will now:

1. Install game
2. Open Daemon Tools or PowerISO and create a new mounting file. Use the extracted folder with all the language folders and the setup.exe
3. Mount this file
4. Play game
5. Any questions
6. Profit
7. The Original Poster of this file is a major ***"
