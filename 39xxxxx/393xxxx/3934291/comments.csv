,Raistlin (DK),2007-12-16T18:39Z,"well not for me :D but it seems like an interesting thing we got here, so thx for upping this release :D"
,leodime,2007-12-18T00:17Z,"Thanks. I knew that if I got the torrent here safely, Microsoft wouldn't be able to do anything about it. They might've gotten all the other links off the net, but they sure won't get it off this one."
,frettub,2008-01-04T06:38Z,"Microsoft can't do shit with torrents since the IPs doesn't show up, and ThePirateBay don't give a flying shit what microsoft want.

So I'd say seed the shit outta this thing!"
,leodime,2008-01-07T23:58Z,"from what I hear, LHR is a big mess so if you want this, then this might be more of a ""historic"" download for memories or testing rather than everyday use. But I hear some people are reviving LHR and some people are decompiling some parts of it to fix bugs and stuff so it's all coming along good. Atleast the community is concerned about Longhorn and are trying to do something about it all."

,leodime,2008-01-27T03:20Z,Wow. That's cool that they released a service pack for it! Glad people are trying to keep the Longhorn spirit alive.
,midaoru,2008-03-23T14:17Z,"i will seed this, coz i really think somebody out there will take up coding this again"
,Machinima,2008-04-23T21:33Z,How do i install this? i mounted it with Daemontools and i install it and i get an i360 error or something....then it tells me to insert my XP profressional disk!!! I dont even have XP Pro! is this because of the i368 or something erorr?
,Lefacavus,2008-05-03T05:53Z,"Small question, I burned it all to a DVD, but when I try to install it, it says it is in compatibility mode and to do exactly what I was already doing. How do I fix this? "

,WINDOWS7,2008-12-29T12:18Z,"Thanks for the upload:)

Please Seed This Damn Thing! If I get it. I WILL SEED THIS FUCKIN THING ALL NIGHT!"
,themoodude,2009-05-05T02:31Z,I'm going to DL even though this appears dead. I'd LOVE to try out Longhorn; never got the chance back when it came around. If I can get this to 100% then I'll seed for as long as I can!
,themoodude,2009-05-09T02:25Z,"So I've got to 100%. Will now seed as long as I can; not got the best connection but I'll do what I can. Just an asside; anyone got this going in VMWare? If so, is it just me or does it run about as slow as a slug on valium? and has anyone managed to get VM-Tools on it?"
,alex94539,2009-08-26T00:01Z,Why the fck am I the last seeder?
,wplaty,2010-01-25T13:54Z,has anyone tried to run this in vbox
,samint64,2010-06-06T11:31Z,"I will seed as long as I can, this piece of nostalgia must be revived from death.... I also dont have the fastest connection, like 798 kb up, all pieces help..."

"
,LordReserei,2010-07-04T01:04Z,"Thanks for the upload, it's gonna take a couple of hours but after I'll seed as much as and as often as I can since I felt a little nostalgic and went on the hunt for Longhorn. 

Wish M$ stuck with it rather than scrap it and felt the need to compete with Apple. We probably wouldn't have had the mistake of Vista had they just stuck with getting Longhorn off the ground. XD"
,dafmat71,2010-07-28T22:28Z,"the best build is 4074, with 2008 patch!!!"
,Ultraware,2010-07-30T20:05Z,"Ok guys, I don't have anything important to do, and I will seed the shit outta this torrent, so people can enjoy it a lot. I will seed it ( will try ) for about 2 months, and hopefully that will be enough! 
Good luck you guys... to bad MS doesn't just release this as a virtual machine image on their website, so people can't use it as a free OS on their real PC..."
,Powlex,2010-09-28T15:48Z,"Here is the serial for this build, TCP8W-T8PQJ-WWRRH-QH76C-99FBW."
,jaaystott,2011-02-09T15:46Z,"Took me 45 minutes to download this in the middle of the day when I should have been at school -_- at the time it had only 1 seeder, until it got to about 2.0% at which it changed and said it had 5 seeders and downloaded about about 170 - 300 kB/s. I will continue to seed Longhorn for aslong as I keep my current OS. I think Microsoft need to go and fuck themselves for giving up on this. Take a good look at Vista, Longhorn is probably a lot less buggy than Vista, and they never even finished building it. As for Windows 7, thats just a facelifted Vista..."
,XV2288,2011-06-25T14:13Z,"Please SEED!
Know anyone what date should i set to run it?
And SEED it :D"
