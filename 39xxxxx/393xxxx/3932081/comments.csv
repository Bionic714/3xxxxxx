,sneed92,2007-12-15T22:33Z,"can't get the keygen to work....
Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item..
Can some1 help me?"
,7omos,2007-12-16T02:41Z,"Here is the deal!
My Kaspersky found a trojan in this keygen.
I do beleive it because the keygen generated a file called ""a.bat"" in the C:\
without giving me a keygen.

I definetly won't recommend downloading this."

NO VIRUSES OR TROJANS.
