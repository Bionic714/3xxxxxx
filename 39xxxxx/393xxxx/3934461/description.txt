Technically speaking, Witness is our hip-hop inclusion on this list, but this Morrisville emcee isn\'t exactly a staple of the local hip-hop scene. Although Witness has said he \"started making hip-hop music at age 15 with intentions of waking up the next day and becoming Kool Moe Dee,\" he has abandoned (for the most part) the traditional rap game for an indie take on the hip-hop genre. His latest EP, Evermore, uses cellos, acoustic guitar and jazz undertones for a beat production that lands somewhere between Buck 65 and DJ Shadow.
