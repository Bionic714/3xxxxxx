Keeping with the spirit for today of distinctly excellent male vocal progressive house production, here are two more absolutely essential and recent tracks that I am completely in love with.

For those who may be unaware, Guy J is yet another extremely talented name in the fields of Electro, Progressive, Tech and Minimal production; and he is very skilled indeed at everything he takes his hand to.

Many may have first come across him by way of his recent production entitled "Save Me" which was featured on John Digweed's "Transitions Vol. 3" compilation mix release.  The same track and also another entitled "Night Loss" (which I enjoy more than "Save Me" were released on the most distinguished Bedrock Records label.

In any case, you can find out more information about Guy J, who hails from the beautiful land of Israel, here:

Heavy but very sophisticated tech elements and steady progressive pace with a mid-way break down for the Original.

Sensuality, longing and well constructed progressive drive for the DJ Yellow remix.



There is one more post to follow for today.


Enjoy and please seed.
