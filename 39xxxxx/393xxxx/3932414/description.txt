The story starts in Angel City where you start your racing career. T.K. (leader of the Urban Maulerz) makes his introduction and offers the player to race him. The challenger gives the player a Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX (from his crew garage)and you race T.K's Mazda RX-8. However, before the race starts, you place a bet with T.K. When the bet is set you race. After the race (win or lose) race winnings and the bet pool goes to the winner, T.K. makes the player a Juiced racer and gives the player a choice of any three tuner cars to offer so he can keep his own car. T.K gives the player a garage and his own mechanic(so he can customize a car). After that, T.K. gives you his phone number and tells the player about entering events and upgrades, then leaves you. The player learns about the Juiced races(being a little weird than other street races). The player races through a series of races, with other crews in Angel City, unlocking rewards, meeting new crews and earning their respect.
