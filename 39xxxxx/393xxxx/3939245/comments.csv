,Bynx,2007-12-19T01:47Z,This movie was made just prior to the actual finding of the ship. It was generally believed the Titanic went down in one piece although witnesses said it broke in half before sinking which proved correct when they found it. This was the best movie from Clive Cusslers books in my opinion.

I saw the movie with a bunch of my shipmates when it was first released in theaters in 1980, but have never seen it again. Thank you, I'm sure I will enjoy seeing it again!!"

Raise the Titanic (1980)

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081400/ 

A model of the Titanic was built for $350,000. When it was finished, it was too big for its tank. A bigger tank had to be built, for $6 million.
