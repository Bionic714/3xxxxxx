[T],_Maelstrom_,2007-12-18T20:05Z,Thank you. I have always wanted to see these but thought they weren't available. Could you provide a link to the 4GB version you mentioned?
,Jezulkim,2007-12-19T13:38Z,"Here: http://isohunt.com/torrent_details/15428678/Jim+Henson%27s+The+Cube  . And sorry, I didn't remember the size of the torrent correct, it is 2 GB not 4. Also there seems to be only one person seeding this torrent (me)."
[T],_Maelstrom_,2007-12-20T03:09Z,"Thank you for the link... and this post as well.
I have wanted to see these for so long that I am actually saving watching this until christmas. =)

Anyhow, at the risk of being a pest, do you have any info on the other release? For instance if it is a direct rip from the DVD or if it has been transcoded? Or where it came from? If they would release all the early Henson stuff on DVD I would order it tomorrow. =)  Thank You again, and I will seed both to at least 200%."
,Jezulkim,2007-12-20T13:33Z,"It's ok, you're not being a pest :). The other release is a direct rip from a dvd, but it seems that it was ripped from a VHS before that. Here's a screenshot of it http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v218/Jezulkim/grab01217.jpg . This is all I know about the release. 

And thanks for seeding :D"

,fluke42,2009-07-24T14:23Z,"wow, i almost thought i would never find it, finally!

and it sure is worth the waiting with only one seeder - but if there is anyone out there who has this, please seed. As soon as i have it i will return the favor bigtime!

thanks Jezulkim for this!"
