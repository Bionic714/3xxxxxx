The Economist Screensaver is a treasure trove of fascinating data on 66 of the world's major economies. Drawing on the 2007 edition of the bestselling ∟Pocket World in Figures↔, it presents facts and figures on population, demographics, the economy, society, health and education around the world. The screensaver also features a ticker displaying the headlines of new articles published on Economist.com, as well as some of the witty one-liners used in The Economist's renowned advertising campaigns. Notes on the data and definitions used in the screensaver are here.

Globe
The screensaver displays a globe that begins rotating on start up. After one minute of inactivity, the globe will stop rotating and data for a randomly selected country will be displayed. After a further 20 seconds of inactivity, the globe will resume rotating. After five minutes Economist advertising slogans will begin to appear.

Countries can be selected manually by clicking on them (data is available only for those countries which appear highlighted in red). To rotate the globe manually, click on the arrows either side of it. Click on the magnifying glass icon below the globe to turn the zoom function on and off.

Clocks
Four clocks at the top of the screen display the time locally, in New York (EST), London (GMT) and Hong Kong.

Article headlines
