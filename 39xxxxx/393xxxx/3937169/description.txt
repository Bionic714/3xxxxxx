"Silver Siren Collection - the third release out of the Antique Dream Land series ? is a musical power pack. A must for those of you who are very much into TD?s tasteful melodic approach. Specifically with this recording you can hear the causal context which combines most of TD?s work through the decades. Figure out if the keynote you might have personally about the band will effect you like a 'chain reaction' as it has been quoted recently. Entirely remastered."
