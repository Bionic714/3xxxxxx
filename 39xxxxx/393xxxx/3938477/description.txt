Low budget Z-Grade horror movie featuring incredibly bad acting, still kinda funny to watch if you're into death metal. Despite the whole movie being apparently "home-made" the combination of imagery and music is pretty good and it has some memorable scenes. The plot revolves around a metalhead who during a radio contest wins a demo tape of his favorite band (the fictional band Living Corpse) He becomes the only owner of the tape and it contains a mysterious unreleased song called 'Zombified' But when he and his friends listen to the song they turn into zombies.

There is also a shorter version of this movie called 'Death Metal Zombies - 10th Anniversary Edition' but this is the original 1995 version.

Soundtrack features the following bands: Amorphis, Anal Cunt, Brutality, Candiru, Count Raven, Deceased, Dead World, Deep Six, Disembowelment, Dismember, Disrupt, Exit-13, Gravy Day, Hypocrisy, Incantation, Living Corpse, Monastat 7, Mortician, Mythic, Pungent Stench, Wicked Wayz, Winter.
