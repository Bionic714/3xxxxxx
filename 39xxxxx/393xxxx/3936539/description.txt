Purple Code - The Rising (Deadmau5 Remix 2007) [Electro / Progressive House]


There were approximately 3,500 hit and run downloads on my release schedule in the last 24 hours.  And that statistic is from Mininova only.  There is no way for me to know what the hit count is on The Pirate Bay.


The longer it takes to well seed torrents that I post, the longer it will take me to post.

Please bear in mind, that every little helps.

Here's the very latest official remix by Deadmau5 that I've been having some fun with.  The Original of this production is tech / progressive flavoured and certainly isn't a bad job.  I find that the Max Graham remix is too mainstream dance style for me.


Deadmau5 seems to have exactly what we want out of this.  Lovely job.



Enjoy and please seed.
