Jason Chambers and Bill Duff venture back to the Land of the Rising Sun
to study one of the most mysterious, subversive, and deadly martial arts
in the world--Ninjutsu. From the electric streets of Tokyo to the misty
mountains of North Japan--our hosts will wield the swords, throwing stars,
and violent takedowns of the Ninja. They'll explore the secret passages of
a 300-year-old Ninjutsu barracks, and hone the secret fighting tactics of 
Japan's immortal shadow warriors. And it's all in preparation for one 
ultimate challenge: a back-to-back showdown with two Ninjutsu masters.
