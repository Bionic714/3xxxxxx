,abredross,2008-01-03T21:42Z,"it's just 2 avi files and 2 other files, didn't have any problems; the video quality is good, and it's the real thing; the only problem is it doesn't have english subtitles, and at the moment english subtitles are nowhere to be found"

,shagpile66,2008-01-15T23:46Z,great quality rip got the subtitles but can't get them to work any ideas anyone
,baddgrrl,2008-01-17T00:11Z,"I changed the two .srt subtitle file names to match the .avi file names.

lustcaution1.srt = Lust.Caution.2007.REPACK.DVDRip.XviD-CiMG-cd1.srt

lustcaution2.srt = Lust.Caution.2007.REPACK.DVDRip.XviD-CiMG-cd1.srt

and the subtitles worked fine."
,cc22f,2008-01-19T00:13Z,Thanks! subs work excellent
,baddgrrl,2008-01-20T09:14Z,I just finished watching this and I'm pretty sure this is the uncensored version.  Pretty lusty.  Enjoy!
,ngr71,2008-01-27T22:48Z,"Great job, thank you."
,EngSubs,2008-01-29T10:16Z,"or you COULD rename Lust.Caution.2007.REPACK.DVDRip.XviD-CiMG-cd1.avi = lustcaution1.avi
Lust.Caution.2007.REPACK.DVDRip.XviD-CiMG-cd1.avi = lustcaution2.avi

but then I'm lazy:)"
,BigDickBubba,2008-01-30T02:36Z,"Can someone please help me with hard coding the subtitles to DVD ? 

I use WinAVI to convert my .avi files, then I burn to DVD using Nero. 

Please help here or point me to your fav tutorial.  Thanks. "
,lagartoflojo,2008-02-01T03:40Z,"@BigDickBubba:
I would suggest ditching WinaAVI and Nero, and start using ConvertXtoDVD. It converts all divx/xvid/etc to DVD format, adds a menu, and burns the DVD. It allows you to add subtitle tracks to your video too (though they won't be hardcoded). You can find ConvertXtoDVD in your favorite torrents site..."
