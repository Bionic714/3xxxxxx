Description:
The second installment of Live From Daryl's House, recorded at Hall's upstate New York home includes partner John Oates and T Bone Wolk, along with the rest of the band as well as a full string section. The concert features songs from the band's recently released "Home for Christmas" album on their own U-Watch/DKE Records label, distributed by ICON Music Entertainment Services, giving fans a version of the current tour, which started Nov. 30th in Chicago and runs through December 17th in Philadelphia.

"Musically, it's amazing, it really came out fantastic," says Daryl of the performance. "We decorated the big room with a Christmas tree and all the trimmings. Anybody that doesn't get a chance to see the live show can catch it online. From a technical standpoint, it's going to be even better than the first one."
