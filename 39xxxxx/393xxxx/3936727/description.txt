               Album Info..:                                                                   
                                                                                               
          A decade after changing the metal landscape drastically with their self-titled debut 
          juggernaut, Korn got the best-of treatment just as their standing began to seem      
          increasingly shaky, commerically at least. Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 sadly isn't the disc
          it ideally could be, but it nonetheless summarizes how steady Korn were over the     
          years, developing their sound oh so slightly from one album to the next and, in the  
          process, coming up with several unquestionably killer songs every go-round. The      
          band's six full-lengths resulted in enough of those killer songs to fill this best-of
          to the brim; in fact, there are quite a few more that could have been compiled here  
          as well if there were more space on this single-disc release (a double disc would    
          have been definitive). As it stands, however, practically every song here is a       
          highlight in and of itself, with the sole exceptions of the below-par ballad-like    
          "Alone I Break" and a space-wasting pair of album-opening covers: Cameo's "Word Up!" 
          and Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall, Pts. 1-3." These covers are here        
          undoubtedly to bait the legions of Korn fans who already own all the band's albums   
          but are loyal enough to purchase this best-of just for this pair of new recordings.  
          And yes, they're quite curious, so much so that you'll want to give them a listen if 
          you're a fan (download them, though -- they're curious, no doubt, but certainly not  
          worth the price of this disc alone). The band's "Word Up!" cover is awesome, and the 
          Pink Floyd cover is well-crafted and grandiose. Then again, these two songs are so   
          well known that you have to wonder, what's the point? Like Korn's previous cover of  
          Metallica's "One," though, the point seems to be one of curiousity rather than       
          one-upmanship. In any event, these covers aren't the best way to start off this      
          best-of -- not at all -- nor is the reverse chronological sequencing ideal. Because  
          Korn developed their sound over the years, even if only slightly, it'd have been     
          better to map out that progressive trajectory here, rather than hear the band regress
          from the elaborate, theatrical bombast of their later albums to the stripped-down    
          naked rawness of their fierce debut. These quibbles aside, it's worthy stating again 
          that there's nothing but great songs here. If you're new to Korn, the most           
          influential and successful metal band of the mid- to late '90s, this disc should blow
          you away -- that is, assuming you're a fan of extreme music with a dark, disturbing  
          edge. But if indeed you're new to Korn, you'd be better off skipping over this       
          best-of and heading straight for their self-titled debut (their one undisputed       
          classic), and then moving chronologically forward through the band's catalog. Each   
          album stands well on its own, albeit some better than others, and here you're only   
          getting the tip of each iceberg. But if money is a concern and you can only afford   
          one Korn disc for your collection, don't think twice about picking up Greatest Hits. 
          You won't be disappointed. No chance of that. Plus, there's a bonus DVD here of      
          Korn's 2003 show at CBGB that will give you a good taste of what the band is like    
          live.                                                                                
                                                                                               
          Ed's Note- We ripped the DVD too; kickass XviD.. Oh yea, look for it where you found 
          this.
