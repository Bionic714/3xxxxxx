This plays back nicely with QuickTime and of course VLC & mplayer.

Note: The audio levels are unusually low but this is how it's been mastered on DVD. Since I'm a purist I left it to your taste to crank the volume up. :P"

I prefer the Sirius Share rip because it's the full length version and the aspect ratio is slightly better than Kilgore's rip.
Still, thanks for this rip. It's not bad."
