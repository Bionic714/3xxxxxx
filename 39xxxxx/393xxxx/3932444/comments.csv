I just wanted to point out that the end of most of the episodes in this get cut off a little bit before the end. It hasn't cut off anything important so far though. Hopefully if you didn't know about this problem (probably a result of some part of the ripping process), you can see if there's a way to fix it for future TTC releases."

Otherwise, great lecture from a great lecturer."

He's just sharing stuff from elsewhere! And thanks also to who did the rip, because there is an example of such an amazing course! I also found in other sites that professor Sean Carroll is atheist. So nice! In my native language I can't find this kind of content, more less with evolutionary and related viewpoints."
