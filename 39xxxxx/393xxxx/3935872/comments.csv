[T],oddeven,2007-12-16T14:00Z,"that is correct, Janniq"
[T],oddeven,2007-12-16T14:07Z,"However, if I was to put out a movie from Armenia, I think I would immediately think of adding Finnish subs to it.  
You know, that comments about subtitles are about the only comments I get from Finns, and pretty much no comments at all about Finnish movies, even though they are fairly popular."
