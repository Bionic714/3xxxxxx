,fpoitr,2007-12-13T00:39Z,"This is a release candidate and the anti-piracy features that are supposed to disable BIOS Emulation Drivers and other hacks aren't going to be included until the actual release in the next quarter. When the official service pack is released, your computer is not going to be going into reduced functionality mode when you haven't activated windows."

I'm just quoting what i read, different source may say different things, i know i wouldn't want to test RC1 on a hacked box unless i knew it was safe, or there's a crack for it. It's only a matter of time before there a way to bypass this.

Quote: Not everything slated for the final version of SP1 has made it into the release candidate, however. Major changes to Vista's antipiracy scheme outlined only last week are not included, for example.

    ==Things to Know Before you Install==
**************************************

Please read the following instructions and cautions prior to installing. 

Before you install:
?	If you have a prior version of SP1 beta installed, you must uninstall it prior to installing RC.   
?	Use the Control Panel applet ?Programs and Features? and select ?View installed updates? from the top left of the task pane.  Under Windows, look for ?Service Pack for Windows (KB936330).
?	Please wait 1 hour after uninstalling a prior build before installing the RC.  The installer service needs to clean up and complete the uninstall prior to installing a later build. Failing to do this can result in installation errors for the RC version.
?	This is pre-release code and will change before the final release.  Windows Vista SP1 Release Candidate is for individuals, organizations, and technical enthusiasts who are comfortable evaluating pre-release software. This pre-release software is provided for testing purposes only.  Microsoft does not recommend installing this software on primary or mission critical systems.  Microsoft recommends that you have a backup of your data prior to installing any pre-release software. 
?	Windows Vista SP1 Release Candidate is Time-Limited software.  It will no longer operate after June 30, 2008 and should be uninstalled prior to that date.  Note: After installation your desktop will show the text ?Evaluation Copy?. This does not mean that your system is no longer ?Genuine?.  It means that you have installed a test version of software which is time-limited.  
?	The ?Evaluation Copy? text will show up on the 2nd boot after installing the service pack.  Likewise, the Evaluation Copy text will remain during the first boot after uninstall, but will disappear after the next reboot.
?	If you install the Service Pack 1 Release Candidate, it is strongly recommended that you also plan to install the final version of Windows Vista SP1 when it is released in the first quarter of 2008. To do this, you will be required to uninstall this pre-release code. 
?	Support is through self-help and peer support via the Windows Vista SP1 forum.  Assisted support (phone, email and online chat) is not available from Microsoft Support for this RC release of SP1.
?	You must have a genuine copy of Windows Vista installed on the computer prior to installing the Windows Vista SP1 update.

Formatted and went back to build 6000, re-installed crack with no problems. I think I'll wait until official SP1 is out next year, and wait another 2 or 3 months until there's a new activation crack for it. "
