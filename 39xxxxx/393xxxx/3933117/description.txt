                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sonic the Hedgehog is an ongoing series of American comic books published by 
Archie Comics, featuring Sega's mascot video game character Sonic. The comic 
book series debuted in the United States at the beginning of 1993, two years 
after the release of the first video game in 1991 for the Sega Genesis. 
Spin-off publications from the comic include a Knuckles the Echidna series 
starring the titular character, which ran for 32 issues; 15 48-page "Super 
Specials"; 8 single special issues; and 4 short three-issue miniseries, each 
starring a character from the series. On September 21, 2005, Archie Comics 
started a new series based on the TV show Sonic X.

Aside from the Sonic X series, all of Archie Comics' Sonic-related series take 
place in the same fictional universe. This universe features a mixture of 
characters, settings and storylines from the Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon, the 
Sonic video games by Sega, and various other incarnations of Sonic. It also 
includes many elements unique to the comic universe. While the ongoing game 
canon has influenced the comic canon, both exist as entirely different 
universes. Sonic the Hedgehog is not to be confused with Sonic the Comic, 
which ran in the UK and published more issues despite running for a shorter 
time (due to UK comics being published on more frequent schedule than in the 
US). As of November 2007, there have been 182 Sonic the Hedgehog regular 
series issues.

This release contains all the comics currently available at the time of its
creation. Each page is formatted to be a 700*1059 Pixel Jpeg image. While the 
Federation has never released a comic library before, the current lack of
comics and comic related groups within the scene is disparaging and 
disheartening and it is thus hoped that this release will encourage other 
groups to join in.

                              Miscellaneous Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please Note The Following:

.I.
Creation of this comic collection took Three hours of unpaid labour. 
.II.
While it is possible it remains unlikely that the federation will ever release
another comic collection as our expertise is largely in coding, securities, 
emulation, and modding.
.III.
I am ZKZ. 
I am an INDEPENDENT member of the FEDERATION group. 
Props to the scene.

This project has consumed most of my time (as well as the time of both the 
Gamer Girl 2 and SallySef) thereby explaining my recent absence from the 
scene and the forums. This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)
Vista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related 
applications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game 
images and roms in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user 
to easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would 
act as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge
undertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with 
the first real replacement for consoles. This will be released within two 
months.

			    Scene Requests/Information
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'The Gamer Girl2' recently joined the Federation and has now been assigned to 
my Co-op/Strategy team. Please thank her for her contributions through the 
forums.

I will be going on hiatus again for roughly two months but 'The Gamer Girl2' 
haspromised to keep the updates coming and I will return to the scene for a 
week at some point to coordinate the release of Half Life: Decay.

As you can probably tell the Federation is currently really short on talented
acsii artists. Jordite (and anyone else who might be interested in some nfo
design), please contact this email as soon as possible:
