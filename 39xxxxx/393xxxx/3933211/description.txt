Co-Directors: Adam Jones and Alex Grey.

If you like this art, you need to support the artists.

Good art costs money to make. The net result of stealing from true artists is less true art and more corporate sponsored art i.e. Nickelback. Thus, you need to buy this DVD. I repeat, YOU NEED TO BUY THIS DVD.

anyway, enjoy this preview:)
