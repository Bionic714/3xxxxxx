 There is no map code that I can find in the file and it is a different format from the Garmin maps. I think the keygen is basically worthless at this point if the code supplied does not work.

Insert the SD card the you want to use into your Garmin.

Start your Garmin And touch the Clock (time) for about 10 seconds...

A secret menu will appear..

Click (Next) couple times until you see the menu for the SD card...

Press (Checksum) and then, the unit ID for THAT SD card will appear... Note that this ID is NOT your Garmin's Unit ID.. This ID is just for that SD card.. Every SD card in the world has diffrent number!

Copy that code in the Key Gen and generate a 25-digit code (upper Generate)

Copy the code into the (gmapsupp.unl) file...

Restart your Garmin...

,juanka007,2008-01-09T07:42Z,"Instructions for Nüvi 200W

1-Insert SD card, touch battery icon for about 5 seconds or so. Eventually you will get into the diagnostic mode of the unit. Once there you will be able to scroll to the SD card and see the unit ID of the SD. The SD ID will be a 10 digit format just like the internal flash ID of the Garmin.
2-Use key gen generator (gk_mod) http://dxp.divxvid.org/b13ffa9a8befa51eeac88bc2040730ed.html (Use Sd Card ID and Map ID 900).
3-Copy de generated key gen resulting from MAP ID in the gmasupp.unl (you need only this one).
4-Restart garmin it will ask to install new extras or not from SD card.
5-Say NO and look in extras for Marco Polo.

If not - try to make installation but before make a backup from POI folder stored in Garmin for security issues."

I made a comment in the thread (there) regarding ProductId and RegionId:

""Now, I dont know if the keygens are coded specific to ProductId AS WELL AS RegionId, if so that could be the problem, because we dont have one that works with ProductId:1, RegionId:1.""

,eriktheheadlouse,2008-01-11T17:49Z,The card ID that you need to enter into the keygen is the 'serial' number underneath the size of your card.
,Nitrox_Diver,2008-01-11T18:09Z,"Works perfect on my Nüvi 200!

No need to use your SD Card ID because you can use your GPS unit ID if you like. :))

Otherwise I followed these instructions :

1. Get the right ID (GPS ID or SD card ID)
2. Insert it in the top box of the modded keygen.
3. Insert the ""map ID"" in the lower box Custom Maps (900 in this case).
4. Hit ""generate"" to get your Map unlock code.

,eriktheheadlouse,2008-01-11T19:00Z,"Here is how I eventually installed it on my Nuvi 660 which already has the new City Navigator Europe NT 2008 map on the same SD card:

1.Upload the .gpi (not the .unl file) file to \Garmin\poi on your SD card.
2. Get SD card ID.
3. Insert it in the top box of the modded keygen.
4. Insert the ""map ID"" in the lower box Custom Maps (900 in this case).
5. Hit ""generate"" to get your Map unlock code.
6. If you already have the new 2008 map on the same SD card then you'll already have a 'gmapsupp.unl' file in the \Garmin directory on your card. It will have the Map unlock code for the new Europe map in it.
7. You need to paste the unlock code for the Travel Guide onto the end of the unlock code for the 2008 Europe map. Do not leave any spaces between the two codes.

The travel guide appears in the 'Travel Guide' section and in 'Extras'.

Enjoy!!"

""7. You CAN paste the unlock code for the Travel Guide onto the end of the unlock code for the 2008 Europe map. Do not leave any spaces between the two codes.""

Also, the item # for the Garmin travel guide is the same for the Nuvi 350 and other nuvi's that this IS working on, so I'm not sure why it wouldn't be the same for the 350."
,HermanRSA,2008-02-12T13:14Z,"The question was also asked by mestguy182. How do one 'PM' someone?(As indicated by Hexen-NI). 
Can someone please help me with the modified keygen for the Garmin Europe Travel Guide.
The keygen in Travel guide for North America DOES NOT WORK on Europe. Neither does Unlock_Utility_Keygen_Utility_Originals_by_JetMouse (Keygen v1.3.exe).
Thanks! (from mail@vodamail.co.za)"
,mestguy182,2008-02-12T23:55Z,"I'm assuming if you are downloading this you have the European maps.  I live in the US and downloaded City guide Europe version 9.  It seems to work perfectly except when I tell it to go from one European location to another, it says it runs out of memory at 52% or something like that.  I'm going to Germany next month and need this to work.  Is it only having this problem because I'm still in the US while trying to route one European location to another?  Thanks"
,HermanRSA,2008-02-14T06:51Z,"I've solved the Europe Travel Guide installation from an SD card on a Garmin Nuvi 310.
Step 1. Find the torrent ""[isoHunt]_Garmin_modded_keygen.exe.1403559.SN"" and download it.
Step 2. Run the Garmin_modded_keygen.exe downloaded file.
Step 3. Get the SD card ID (NOT the GARMIN ID). To get it, place the SD card in the Garmin, press and hold the time display. Then press next until the SD Card detail is displayed. The card id will be indicated.
Step 4. In the Garmin_modded_keygen.exe, type in the SD card no in Unit ID. Go down to Select Map Product, select Custom and type in 900. Then click Generate at the bottom right.
Step 5. Open Notepad software. Paste the generated key in notepad.
Step 6. Save the notepad file as gmapsupp.unl on the SD Card under the directory \Garmin where the POI folder is with the MPFULLEUROPE file in the POI folder.
Step 7. Unplug Garmin from PC and let it restart.
Step 8. The Garmin will then request the option to save the data on the unit Yes/No. The option is yours. Depending on how much space is avialable on the unit. If you select no, the Travel Guide will still work.
Step 9. On the Garmin, select Travel Kit, Travel Guide. You'll then see Marco Polo Europe.
ENJOY!!!"

,mikasand,2008-05-29T20:12Z,"I use Garmin Nuvi 350 and its works great.


1. Get keygen: http://torrents.suprnova.org/1403559/Garmin_modded_keygen.exe.1403559.SN.torrent

2. Hold clock display for 10 seconds and get into Nüvi service mode.

3. Step forward 2-3 times until you see Sucure Digal SD card, then insert SD card.

4. Write down SD card serial number and then restart your Nüvi.

5. Start keygen. 

6. Use SD Card serial number as Unit ID in the keygen.

7. Select map ""MAPID"" and type in 900.

8. Generate code by the generate button (the last one).

9. Paste the generated code in new file, using notepad.exe

10. Create folder Garmin in the SD Card.
11. Create subfolder POI in the SD card (below Garmin)

12. Save the notepad file as  MPFullEurope.unl  in the POI folder in the SD Card.

13. Extract MPFullEurope.gpi from the Zip file and place it together in same folder  (Garmin\POI) in the SD Card, there are now two files in this folder, both have same name but with different extension.

14 Insert SD Card (if it is not already installed)

15 Restart Nüvi."
,stacker02,2008-06-24T05:37Z,"I been reading around, it seems the only people to get this working are the Garmins listed on the product compatibility page of the Travel Guide:

the Nuvi 300 series, the 600 series, Street Pilots and Zumo's. I have a 750 and have run into the same issue as many. I have installed other maps, but nothing budges for this one. Can people confirm it works on other models of the garmins???"
,stacker02,2008-06-24T16:09Z,"I got it to work. Wow.

1. Got SD ID #
2. Copied gmapsupp.unl and POI folder ( with MPFullEurope.gpi) to SD card under a folder I created called Garmin
3. Ran modded keygen called: KG MOD 6in1
4. Click Marco Polo
5. Copy code to UNL file, put SD card into Garmin 750 
6. Start Nuvi
7. Welcome to Installer ;)"

For Garmin Nüvi 710 you get into Service Mode by pressing the ""Battery Indicator"" 10 sec. "
,funk74,2009-03-24T05:36Z,"Works great on a Nuvi 660. Followed mikasand's directions using a Kingston 2GB SD card. Did not work on a Lexar 2GB card as it only had a 9 digit ID number. Works great right off the card without installing onto the unit. I also put the full 2009 City Navigator map on the same card and it just fits.

Is this the most current guide?

Thanks for the upload."
