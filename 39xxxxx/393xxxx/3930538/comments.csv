,ghjsfffgfdgfg,2007-12-15T09:31Z,I am really trying to get 5 different episodes but I am getting speeds of 1 kbyte and u/l ratio of 12:1. 
,nocko22,2007-12-28T16:04Z,"I'm getting an average of 25 KB/s and I'm uploading as fast as I can (about 40-50 KB/s)

I was only getting one tracker, maybe it's just me and my ISP blocking or something. But now it alternates between a piratebay tracker and denis.stalker.h3q.com "
