,silence951,2007-12-31T22:30Z,mkv is as good as any container format ... learn to use codecs properly and you might not have to waste your time at all -.-
,vertorat,2008-06-02T05:42Z,is it at all possible to to the get the rest of the series. the odd episode here and there is very fragmented.  this is an excellent series. does anyone know if there are complete series torrents of this show from 1 to the very end?
