Review
Taken from their stunning recent album "Crossroads", this Super - Limited CD Single ( 600 copies and only available via mail-order ) presents one of the most storming tracks from that album in three  unreleased versions and includes the Exclusive track "One Day". Presented in a Promotional DJ only 'paperboard' sleeve this ultimate collectors item is a must for fans and newcomers to M.I.A.B and is sure to sell out fast
