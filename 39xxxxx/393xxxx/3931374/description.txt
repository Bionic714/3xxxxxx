Franz Biberkopf is an unforgettable man : He is tender, good-natured side contradicted by moments of shocking violence. Released from prison following a four year sentence for manslaughter of his girlfriend, he plans to make a new start and a decent life for himself. But a chaotic, decadent Berlin of the 20s is not the easiest place for a ex-con to go straight and work is hard to come by, When Franz becomes faschinated by Reinhold, a psycotic small-time crook, he is soon drawn back into a world he cannot escape.

Fassbinders staggering 15 hour epic is a monument of late 20th-century filmmaking and considered to be the directors masterpice. Following a massive restoration project overseen
