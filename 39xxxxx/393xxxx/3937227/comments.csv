no routers for the uk in this program, so cannot portfoward and change."
,dicandy,2008-01-02T22:14Z,This serial does not work!
,fonejacker13,2008-01-21T03:10Z,they are all fakes.. there is no REAL cracked version of this program.. best go onto their website and configure your port forwarding manually.. it aint hard
,caribbeanhotrod,2008-02-28T20:30Z,Who the fuck uploads a software without a valid serial (Lingay1 go grab a pole and ride it)
,judi_007,2008-03-07T19:52Z,"Cracked worked for me, running A.O.K"
,judi_007,2008-03-07T19:54Z,"download the latest version software from the official site, and then use the serial."
,SumeklamKidd,2008-04-19T16:05Z,"Don't run the program when it says ""Do you want to run the program.

Open from start menu, copy/paste username and serial. Runs fine on XP. I've tweaked XP with XP smoker, so this might be an option for some of you to do prior to installing this program."
