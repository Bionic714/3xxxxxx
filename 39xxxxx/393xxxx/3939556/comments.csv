,Lakritslemmel,2008-03-11T11:47Z,"The latin roughly translates to:

""The death of the living Janus and the life of the dead Janus""

Janus was the Roman god of entrances and exits, i.e. the god of beginnings and endings. He is often portrayed with two faces, always looking back and always looking forward. The word ""ianus"" can also mean ""portal"" or ""arched entrance"". ""Ianua/Ianva"" (in Rome u and v looked the same) is the genitive form of ""Ianus""."
