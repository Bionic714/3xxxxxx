My First psycho post here on Pirate Bay and i got the [b]The Pagan Dead[/b] with their fantastically long latin titled [i]Mors Ianva VitÃ?Â¦ et Vita Ianva Mortis[/i]
(If any one knows what that means that would be awesome to post in the comments section.)dark brooding horror filled psycho goodness. if you threw lucio fulci, a slap bass, a whole bunch of metal and some 80\'s horror movies in a blender you\'d get an idea what the pagan dead sound is like.


Bio: (off their site- http://www.pagandead.com)
-------------------------------------------------------------


From the depths of the Stygian Realm comes the Pagan Dead. A Chimera of Metal and PsychobillyÃ¢??Goetic Vocals, Metallic Guitar, Frenzied Slap Double Bass, & Pounding Death-Beat Drums all come together to open the Gates of Hell......Come Join the Dead!

\"Death-metal-inspired psychobilly with horrific lyrics, guttural vocals, snarling guitar, chugging double-bass and drums shouldn&t sound so sweet ... and yet, it does. It\'s fast, it\'s brutal, it\'s grotesquely awesome and awesomely grotesque.\"--Randy Harward
