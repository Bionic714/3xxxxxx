,Yar_Maties,2008-09-13T22:13Z,"Poddez- no, just the ones in Bangkok. And Chonburi. Also, Phuket. And, well, much of Thailand.

But some of it's a cultural thing. There isn't really the virgin/slut polarity of the west. Sex is just a way to make a living."
,Tryst49,2008-11-16T02:04Z,"Thai prostitutes are considered businesswomen in Thaliand. The legal ones are subjected to frequent tests for aids etc, the ones that test positive are banned from working. Policing that and catching the illegal ones is a nightmare in a country where sex for sale is a common thing.

Caution: If you ever go for the sex though and the girl looks young, make sure she proves her age to you in front of at least two witnesses you can name before you do anything with her. It's hard to tell, some Thai girls look a lot younger than they actually are.

Sex is viewed as a form of currency. It's not unusual for Thai girls to happily have sex with you and live with you just to get citizenship to your country. Say bye bye after two years when she gets it. Or do what I am thinking of doing, a nice fresh 18 year old every two years, Nothing like a bit of variety to spice up your sex life :)"
