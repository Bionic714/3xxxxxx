,Kottkvarn,2008-03-13T23:42Z,"He's just saying thanks, which I do too!"
,hjultomten_1,2008-03-21T14:18Z,"He's saying:

Thank you thank you

I've been trying to download this one at another place for a while now, but they did not seed, so thanks a million (or acctually ""uber tack"" is from the german word ""über"", meaning ""above"" but is used in Swedish for saying that something is really big, and ""tack beeing the Swedish word for ""thank you"". Also when he is saying ""tackar"", it's an inflection for ""tack"" meaning that he is thanking you) 

Just thought you ought to know :) 

I just personaly want to say 

TACKAR! 

you rock man! 

hope the quality is as good as the speed :D

xD"
