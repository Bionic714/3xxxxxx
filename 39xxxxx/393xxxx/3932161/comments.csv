,vassock,2008-08-05T10:05Z,"Have not found a crack for this yet. Doubt there ever will be one. Protection is difficult to defeat, must be a new version of Starforce. This might work, though:

1. Replace the small mds file (5kb) with the big one (39kb).

2. Use latest version of Alcohol 120 to burn the image using the Starforce set of settings (burn RMPS) to a DVD5 (~4.4 GB). That is the standard DVD media, non-rewritable.

3. Insert burned DVD into a USB DVD-Reader.

4. Patch to 1.11, THEN install the translation:

5. Start Alcohol 120 (if not already started), go to Emulation, and select the enable RMPS option, then hit okay and wait for it to be enabled. Keep alcohol running.

6. While alcohol is running with RMPS enabled and with the burned copy of the 39kb MDS (and the associated MDF file) file in your USB DVD-reader, launch the game.

Should work, but unfortunately, requires an external USB DVD-Reader.

Also, the game has memory leaks, unfortunately. Patch doesn't help much."
