There's about 50 leechers per download x 8 downloads doesn't give a lot out.

Just want to help share these as quick as possible. "

,SphinXXXXX,2008-07-21T00:05Z,"Dude, I think it's a ""Image File"" use ""Deamon Tools"" or any ""Virtual Drive"" software to open the file.."
,Lil_Lad,2008-11-04T21:27Z,Hey Danvart I think there is something wrong with the quicktime video #33.  I can't seem to copy it onto my hard drive.  It keeps saying something about error MS-DOS format or something.
,Lil_Lad,2008-11-04T23:04Z,Oh! yah and btw the rest of the files are fine.  I copied them with no problem.  The only file I couldnt copy is the quicktime video 33 like I said before there is a error with MS DOS.
,Lil_Lad,2008-11-04T23:07Z,"I could view the video #33 fine and the DT player works fine, I just want to copy the content of the cd into my harddrive so then I wouldnt need to use any .iso or .cue etc. to view the cd. "
