,cool_midnight_rambler,2007-12-20T10:59Z,Does anyone else have problems running the .iso?
,cool_midnight_rambler,2007-12-20T11:22Z,"Seems i can run it from the exe file in the ""the update"" folder.

Still cant install it...."
[V],Slickinator,2007-12-22T00:38Z,"all you do is install the game then copy the cd file over to the main file and double click it and then copy over the files out of the update folder to the install folder thats all , just install you can mount the iso for the purpose of installing but thats the only way you can and make sure you install full"
,Naruto_fan,2008-01-06T16:35Z,"Heres how u do it, when u have the game (iso), mount it, when u have extracted all files, find the place where they are, then go into crack, and u will notice that there are 2 cracks instead of 1 in the folder that the iso was in, copy both cracks and put them in monopoly folder (where u installed game). Before that u must have copied all files from the update and have them in ur monopoly map, simply doubleclick the cracks and u may now use the game without any problem"
[V],Slickinator,2008-02-16T03:38Z,yes he is right i was reading from an older version sorry
[V],Slickinator,2008-02-22T19:30Z,yes the main folder has a crack and txt there read the one that is in the iso not the one with it forgot to remove it and made it the wrong text info below sorry was in a rush and missed that but it does work if you use the cracks on the disk sorry and yet enjoy

,Odissa,2008-09-13T08:48Z,"I just got this game working, however during the middle of gameplay, it seems to give me an .exe error and closes out on me. Any idea on how to fix this and stop it from closing? Seems to only happen when I'm trying to build houses/use bank/mortgage, etc."
