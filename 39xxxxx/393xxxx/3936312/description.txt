The Exiles are a group of fictional comic book characters from Marvel Comics. The Exiles, created by writer Judd Winick and artist Mike McKone, consists of characters from different dimensions, or realities, which have been removed from time and space in order to correct problems (often called Ã¢??hiccups") in various alternate worlds and divergent timelines in the multiverse. The team usually is made up of six members and each time a member is killed or returned to his or her home reality, a new member is introduced and joins the team. However, the series is notable for the number of characters who stay dead, in contrast to the frequent resurrections that occur in the main Marvel and DC continuities.
