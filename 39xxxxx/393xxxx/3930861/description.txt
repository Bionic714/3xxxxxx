The cover of this holiday classic pictures Ray Charles with a sleigh-full of gifts. That's an appropriate image, since he's so generous with the soulful sounds contained inside. Ray's gravelly growl may turn sweet on such merry romps as "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" and "Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town," but he doesn't fully hit his groove until he delves into the set's more grown-up material. He gives "Winter Wonderland" a soul transfusion the likes of which you won't see on many televised Christmas specials, and really lights a fire under "Baby, It's Cold Outside." Now that's the spirit!
