My internet connection at home is off, so i am forced to seed using open wi-fi networks. Please be patient. This torrent is not dead, if you can't download just leave it open and i will continue to seed as much as possible."

Please tell me - Is this an ISO-file, just to burn and play in the old Xbox?"
,jackie6,2008-01-18T06:50Z,"It was not an ISO-file, who do I burn it?"
,unrar,2008-01-21T16:31Z,"this is just the files. you can either ftp them to your xbox's hard drive, or you can download a program called c-xbox tool and use it to create an xbox iso of the unzipped directory. just make sure that the default.xbe is in the root directory of the iso."
