Slowburn master torrent #001

DPA 4061 -> Microtracker 24/48

Recorded from section 407, row J

This is not the best recording I have ever made. Not even close. Section 407 is all the way up in line with the ending of the floor. Fortunately I managed to move down from the second to last row which was considerably higher up than row J

Since this show is what it is I assume most can live without perfection for awhile. I'm sure better sources will turn up but this is listenable and will give you a great feel for the show.

I left the crowd in there to give the full experience.

There is a small problem about a minute into the first song. Not sure what happened. It's on the master.

I have downsampled and converted using adobe audition 1.5. No other changes have been made to the master. Please do not upload any remasters of this recording. Thank you.
