And I remembered, the Resolution is the all picture (720xabout306)."

Maybe this one should have a file size of closer to 1 gb, as to better preserve the quality.  Oh well.  Thanks for the upload, though."

You use a codec for HD quality and encode a good movie for 20hrs...and the result is some BS in sh*t quality :) What's the point please?
