,INSOCCR,2008-11-06T18:58Z,"Mr. Wintermute: You are a great compilator. The synthpop/ebm/future/goth industry should hire you as a master compilator because all the commercial available compilations always features 2 or 3 great songs, 2 fair songs and the rest are mediocre or just plain bad songs. You're compilations are great show off of how good this music is and why it should deserve more radio play!"
