,kevin242,2007-12-13T03:10Z,thanx for the upload but can someone seed this???!!??
,yersinia,2007-12-13T13:04Z,"Sorry I'm the only one that has this file since I created it.  I'm not online all the time and my upload speed for that file aint too good for some reason(idk how to configure to only let upload for one file, im using azureus)."
,olmokram,2007-12-13T18:13Z,just stop the other seed files :P
,john_who,2007-12-13T20:19Z,"Yes please, seed! :)
Fallout is one of the best games ever created imo, I own the windows version but it does not run in codeweaver. Should I try darwine?"
,kivutar,2007-12-15T02:38Z,Would love a seed on this... stopped dead after about 200MB.
,aliosha,2007-12-18T23:18Z,"What you can (and should) do is
a) stop the other torrents
and
b) enable Ultrapeer: this means that Azureus will first of all to seed a single whole copy of the torrent, not giving the same piece twice. That's what I do when seeding something new.
Thank you for the game, I'd like to get it...

,yersinia,2007-12-20T21:48Z,"Yeah sorry guys I cant upload all the time for various reasons, but I will slowly and painfuly seed until some others can seed.  More details about how to enable ultrapeer would be good."

,CompKaBoom,2008-02-15T08:17Z,"amazing how many people will trust some mysterious file and not to mention it being uploaded by someone with a name that is only known as a bacteria that promotes the spread of plague, along side the fact that yersinia is a program that will take advantage of network holes..check it out

i would think 3 or 4 times before downloading any of this guys mysterious ""its just the app but seems to work fine"" crap. and i did download this and tested it..it only has about 4 actual security holes but hey..who ever checks that stuff out. the mac is far from safe anymore people ...wake up and thanks intel thanks alot :)"
,CompKaBoom,2008-02-15T08:19Z,your on the right track blackhawk but way too intense..your going to blow a gasket :P
,Blackhawk1969,2008-02-15T18:00Z,"yeah, i guess your right...blowing a gasket over a worthless fool. if this punk doesnt get punched in the face everyday its only because he keeps his fat mouth shut in the real world."
,yersinia,2008-02-17T22:56Z,"Shut the fuck up, who do you think you are talking to me like that?  You're such a big man, the classic ""if only i could see in you real life, id punch you"" great, really mature.  Maybe you should host other things than Harry Potter and other gay ass shit like that, yeah I bet you're a real sensitive muscle man you big homo-erotic movie loving fan!  All that testosterone, you must be a real important person in you leather man bars huh! LOL"
,yersinia,2008-02-17T23:05Z,"As for the nickname, its just a fucking nickname, jeez how fucking stupid are you?  Next time I'll post under the nick: ""Not a virus"".  Get a life.  And the program seems to be pretty old and kinda buggy, I wouldnt be surprised if it did have a few security holes, I wouldnt know.

CompKaBoom you're an idiot, some people have lives and dont know everything about fucking computers ok?  You ungrateful shit.  You say stuff like I owe you something, dont download anything if you're such a pussy.  

Your comment is as intelligent as: I wouldnt download stuff from you since your nick is CompKaBoom (as in your computer will blow up if you download this)."
,Iggins420,2008-02-26T05:56Z,"This is an Intel version, not universal."
,Iggins420,2008-02-26T06:08Z,"Nevermind that, the torrent comment says Intel, but it works on PPC."
,Shiek,2008-02-28T18:20Z,works great on my intel c2d macbook!  Thanks!

Anyone have a solution?"

Leopard issue, methinks."
,Needsmorepaintball,2008-04-02T06:17Z,"Well glad its not just me. It cant be solely a Leopard problem can it? I ran both Fallouts I downloaded off here fine on my 07 MBP, but when my 08 got here, no go.

I have searched the whole web with no answers."

,zanderohm,2008-08-05T04:49Z,"heard that it is a 256-colour problem with Leopard... maybe a fix is on the way, but if you updated to the new OS this, and a few other games, won't be running proper like..."
,tmas01,2008-08-13T21:18Z,"No, it's not Universal. It's a PPC binary, so it's running in Rosetta emulation.

Thanks though, I'm looking forward to playing this again."
,23joecool,2008-08-25T03:21Z,If you have latest LEOPARD updates 10.5.3 and up - do not bother downloading. I just did only to find out that i cannot play the game due to 256 color mode which is no longer supported in latest Leopard.

,Vault609,2008-10-20T03:55Z,"***NOTE***

All Macbook and Macbook Air users who have 1.5.5 updated on their computers CANNOT PLAY THIS GAME. The graphics just won't work. If you have 1.4 or lower there are graphics updates that are available that should make it work. "

i have a macbook 2008 if that helps"
,strmbrg,2008-11-05T19:01Z,Same here.I had to reinstall my osx.
,Pandabitch,2008-12-06T22:23Z,seend plz
,Sniper2654,2008-12-14T22:40Z,"The 256-Color patch the people have posted is NOT a virus, but it is for NVidia cards only. If you try to install it on a Mac with a different graphics card, your system will not run. I made the mistake of doing this myself, and I was able to re-boot in safe mode and uninstall the file. Hope that helps."
,Wheel83,2009-04-25T03:02Z,"Thanks a million for this man. Been looking everywhere for it.
File works perfect. Just unzip and play on a Mac OSX.
I wouldn't listen to that ""upload as an ISO crap"". This couldn't have been easier to download and play.
thanks"
,Wheel83,2009-05-11T18:52Z,Did anyone else have a problem with the game crashing as soon as you hit the end game cinematics?
,noshadow,2009-05-28T22:42Z,"please seed, I'm stuck at around 50%... I plan to seed it myself once it's downloaded."

,Chks_Da_Dem0n,2009-12-20T06:22Z,please seed I really miss playing this game.
,TheAC30fSpades,2010-02-06T18:01Z,"Okay, the same thing happened with Fallout 1, but every time I open it, it goes to fullscreen and the playable screen isn't in color and is all the way to the left (For example - this is my screen [____].  This is where I can move my cursor and I'm supposed to play [_|___]).

My MacBook is from 2007 Christmas time so I don't know what's wrong."
,yersinia,2010-02-10T17:22Z,"LOL, I'm the uploader and I just opened Fallout 1 and 2 and they both give me a black screen.  WTF is Apple doing to the OS all the time, it seems they keep fucking it all up."
,TheAC30fSpades,2010-02-10T17:41Z,"Exactly... I thought it may have something to do with the packaging.  

Maybe if you can play it in a window it would work because when I first opened it, the little window opened with the Fallout Pipboy I think on it clearly.  Or would you be able to upload a version that's up-to-date?

Thanks!"
,yersinia,2010-02-17T16:46Z,"@TheAC30fSpades: What I uploaded is the app directly taken from the disc, so needless to say it's not up to date. But, the fact that Interplay died prematurely a long time ago, we get only a superficial update which is pretty hard to find on the net anyways. Right now, my game discs for fallout 1 & 2 are lost in my house somewhere. What I will do is try to find it whenever I have time and re-install it. I'll give an update after that."
,yersinia,2010-02-17T16:49Z,"Furthermore, I think it has to do with the lack of 256 color support for snow leopard. That's the only thing I can think of, then again I'm not extremely computer savvy."
,tbp097663,2010-02-24T04:07Z,"For people who want to play one of the Fallout series but this isnt working for them, Fallout 1 and 3 fro mac are both on the piratebay, and i can say that fallout 3 works great on an intel mb osx 10.5.8"
,yersinia,2010-03-08T01:21Z,"Comment written by sdlotu: After reading various speculations on the 'white screen/black screen' at boot problem on Fallout 2 with Snow Leopard, I decided to try the game on several different Mac platforms. All the Intel systems were running fully updated 10.6.2, the PPC is running 10.5.8, which is the last OS supported on PPC. Here is my result:

PowerMac G5 early 2004, with ATI 9600 Pro video: Normal operation.
iMac CoreDuo 20"", early 2006 with ATI x1600 video: White screen issue.
iMac Core2Duo 24"", early 2008 with ATI HD2600 video: White screen issue.
MacBook Pro Core2Duo 15"", early 2008 with nVidia 8600M GT video: Normal operation
MacBook Pro CoreDuo 15"", late 2006 with ATI x1600 video: White screen issue

On the last model, I ran FO2 successfully before upgrading to 10.6. When upgraded to 10.6.0, it gave a black screen, and when updated to 10.6.2, it gave a white screen.

I actually tested a couple of models of each of the above, but only listed one example since the results were consistent. Also, I tested these models with FO2 original and killap's patch for Mac, and the results were identical.

My conclusion, from the admittedly limited testing shown above:

The black/white screen problem stems from graphic driver updates included in the 10.6 and 10.6.2 updates, and not from the OS update per se. These updates are apparently ATI drivers, since the nVidia systems continue to run the game with no issues. There were two different updates from ATI included in Snow Leopard, each with a different issue as seen with the last test model. I expect that FO2 will not run on any system with ATI cards and 10.6 or later.

From my testing it seems the nVidia cards, specifically the 8600M GT included with a large number of MacBook Pro systems in 2007 and 2008, were not updated via 10.6 and continue to work fine with FO2. It is possible that other nVidia cards were unaffected as well.

I invite other readers to indicate if their nVidia cards were affected, and which ones.

,yersinia,2010-03-08T01:22Z,"So in essence, its ATIs fault because they just didnt update or think of adding support for the driver update in snow leopard. Motherfuckers."
