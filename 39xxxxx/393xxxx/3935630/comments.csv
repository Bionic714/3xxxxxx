,suomi_poika,2007-12-16T14:16Z,"so this is real?? no fucking fake!!???? i am downloading 3 fake, hoping someone is real..."
,kingdur,2007-12-16T18:35Z,This shit is password protected....try to unzip and it needs a password ....so without that It don't work.
,MassivePrivate,2007-12-16T18:47Z,Kingdur is right...shit needs a password
,ejldk,2007-12-16T18:51Z,"ehm, how can an *.avi file need a password?!:S"
,fragomatic,2007-12-16T19:13Z,"This is probably real:
because the uploader has hundreds of uploaded files.

Though, I dought that the image quality will be any good. The sound will be okay."
,shuey707,2007-12-16T19:16Z,"The camera wasn't focused on the screen, and the part you could see had someone moving in and out of it constantly.  Cell phone goes off a couple of times in the movie, and there is constant noise.

video-3/10
audio- 6/10"
,steve1700,2007-12-16T20:01Z,watchable :)
,steve1700,2007-12-16T20:32Z,just tell the guy to move his head over
,tifaniamber,2007-12-16T23:12Z,thank-you  this is real no password bullshit.
,Kinthesky,2007-12-16T23:21Z,Let remember both kingdur and MassivePrivate are both full of shit if this doesn't require a password. I wonder what thier game is?
,Warcloud,2007-12-17T00:37Z,"Worked fine for me.

Kingdur and MassivePrivate
fuck you and the Hollywood system. You can't stop us."
,heimdall39,2007-12-17T00:38Z,This'll be the third time I've tried downloading this film. One movie in 100 interests me and it's got a message from shiteaters who redirect you to a website instead of just giving you the file.
,BadBing,2007-12-17T00:42Z,this quality sucks really hard.. why upload a soo bad file?
,heimdall39,2007-12-17T00:46Z,"If it works without a password I'll seed this MF for a  week. If it has a password, I'm going to delete the shit. I'm tired of being sent all over the fucking internet looking for some hidden viewing method / secret codec."
,masterangler,2007-12-17T05:09Z,"Hello All !! I just finished watching the file on vlc media player !!!  IT PLAYS FINE AND NOOOOO IT DOES NOT NEED A PASSWORD !!!  yes.... a cell phone goes off a couple of times and the picture is far less than "" blu ray"" quality...stop whining and start seeding!!!    Thanks for all your efforts everyone .. GREAT JOB !!!  and yes ... I too am a great seeder !! PEACE ALL"
,Mahs,2007-12-17T09:21Z,"I'll admit i really want to download this file:/ but i do not want any cam version of it:P i'm looking forward      to this movie, so ill just wait for the dvdrip.."
,big69papa69,2007-12-17T09:30Z,why cant i get this to download
,Cazdoc,2007-12-17T10:05Z,"Yeah its real, Sync is great, Movie looks Great...

,stylecode,2007-12-17T10:41Z,"i'll just download it... @800K/s, 
there's nothing to waste..."
,xroblade,2007-12-17T11:30Z,looks dark on the trailer is it dark on this avi?
,tobreakcustom,2007-12-17T13:47Z,"Stop listening to the disinfo agents sent here to try and stop us. This shit does NOT need a password and plays perfectly fine in VLC media player.

The quality is bad, though. I'd wait a couple more weeks for some better releases, hopefully and R5 drops. If you can't wait, though, go ahead and download this."
,thefan,2007-12-17T14:14Z,"Well after reading all of u...i am really fuuzzzeedd...

Will try my luck any way...."
,thecatspjamas,2007-12-17T14:54Z,Excellent job mixer music. Only real file ive found. (Even if it is the same dodgy one with the guys head in the corner...  =)  )  Good job mixermusic and keep seeding everyone! dont let a good torrent die!
,scottdavislasvegas,2007-12-17T15:01Z,"this movie SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!! no plot . no action, terrible story and bad acting, only thing good is the little bit of comedy and this is supposed to be an action thriller. damn hoolywood!!!!!!!!

props to the loder and cam man for the effort. cam operators need to test quality and setup during the trailers instead of the first 15 minutes of every movie. good job anyway, i know i wouldn't do it any better, just saying that's the only issue we ever see here on TPB"
,jagardod,2007-12-17T17:29Z,i cant find a codec to this movie can somebody help me? p.s windows vista sucks
,romanof,2007-12-17T18:22Z,"i got a message to those from ''iamsecurityfromhollywood'' who have said it needs a password. FUCK OFF! you cant stop us, we are the free people who's fighting for free movies and games.   
And to those who said its bad, if you dont like it just dont watch!!!!!  
thanks mixermusic for great seeding :D i really appreciate it i've waited for this movie too long Xd"

,Windsong1,2007-12-17T20:40Z,"I have notices that when fakes show up on pb they are flooded with comments I also noticed that the comments that are with the torrent repeat over and over like a bot would do might be a fake, but what the hell i'm in no rush to see the film. I will download it and give the group a truthful review ....  later till the download is done"
,rumpypumpy1,2007-12-18T01:11Z,"I would truly appreciate knowing how people have gotten this to play, had to rename to .rar. Then find
legend sample. legend sample2 and legend avi - try to unpack and it's passworded. SO SO tired of this. 
Share by all means but not passworded trash - what a waste of bandwidth.
DONT DOWNLOAD OR SEED>"
,rumpypumpy1,2007-12-18T01:28Z,"sorry forgot to add- look out for the nasty little executable in the nfo file my_server.exe

some not very nice people out there i think."
,davelonghorn,2007-12-18T02:22Z,"rumpypumpy:

mate, if you click on files... it clearly shows that the film is in the format of an avi. file.....are you fucking some sort of remedial comedian!!!!??? sad fucking loser, go fuck your mam she is waiting for you, its been nearly an hour since last time"
,heimdall39,2007-12-18T03:00Z,"this works, and though it is far from good quality, it is watchable."
,heimdall39,2007-12-18T03:02Z,And there are no rar files And there is no password. And the people who are saying that there are those things are either traitors or more ignorant than a piece of shit.

,michaelrwatson,2007-12-18T03:54Z,"p.s. naturally, the sample images (.jpg's) look okay because they're *not video*, so you can't see the horrible flickering."
,sfacets,2007-12-18T13:08Z,"Thanks for this... but what did you use to record this, your cellphone?"
,Windsong1,2007-12-18T14:31Z,"will I'm back with the report. the torrent is real and has no Password.If you like watching movies over sombodys sholder this one is for you.lol the video flickers from fromt to end and the last part the audio get so out of sysn that it is like watching a old janapese karata flic.you know the kind where they talk for a minute then you hear the work. the movie it self sucked it should have been called ""28 days later with will smith"" because that is what the plot is.with zombies and the works hehehhah.Sad to say that there are 3000 seeds and 4000 peers right now that are in for a BIG letdown when they see this torrent. I think this is going to be the first will smiths  flop...it's a good"" beer"" movie you would have to get drunk to enjoy it.So pop open a six pack and download away."
,zsq,2007-12-18T15:03Z,"This movie sucks! The trailers were promissing, but the flick itself was sooo fuckin' dissapointing...
28 days later with the annoying ""the postman"" and ""waterworld"" pathos.
And then now the spoiler: Will blows himself up with a handgrenade, so a woman and a child can have a safe gettaway...why didn't the stupid fuck hide in the same place as the others and just throw the damn' thing from over there? Beats me...
Still..thanks for the upload mixermusic!"
,babylaton,2007-12-18T15:38Z,wierd it downloads as avi but wonyt play on any codec unless you winrar it first and then yess it does need a password
,jagardod,2007-12-18T15:46Z,does anybody know the password??
,travdog,2007-12-18T15:57Z,"I didnt realize we had a couple of movie critics in our midst. Keep your fucking comments to yourself unless they are about the quality of the audio/video. Stop ruining it for the rest of us,  DICKSMOKERS!!!!!!!"

,rumpypumpy1,2007-12-19T00:48Z,"davelonghorn

r u a troll. yes-
r u a fool. yes-
if it was .avi it would play - and renaming to .rar would yield an error.
sad. think if you can, but not too hard you might hurt yourself.

this upload is trash - DON'T waste your bandwidth!"
,shdwfx,2007-12-19T01:38Z,"O.o mixermusic you are  lame ass and a liar, the quality sucked and is someone elses."
,Rudster65,2007-12-19T04:54Z,"HOW!!!! and I repeat... How did this make the top 100!!!!!!! If you people downloading would rate these movies , after you download, instead of bitchin at each another, this movie is a 1/ 10 video, and even worse audio, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME or anyone elses I can't believe that there are not 3117 bad comments about this movie download, My 8 yr old could of done better, Im not sniveling, it just pisses me off when people say its 6/10 video, and 5/10 audio, and it is pure 100% crap"

,rustynails69,2007-12-19T16:39Z,"Did you ever think, that maybe the people lying about this movie requiring a password, might be employees of the movie studio,and by lying about it being password protected, they stop some people from downloading this movie. Obvious isn't it."
,kaneman,2007-12-19T22:47Z,Wow. I think that guy's fucking head shadow is going to be permanently burned into my Iris....shit I was staring at it for nearly two fucking hours....DO NOT waste time on this ....unless you enjoy a good head shadow. 
,rustynails69,2007-12-20T00:26Z,"You can only see half the movie screen, the other half is of a guy drinking a huge soda blocking the screen. Here's a tip for Cam jockies, record the movie during an afternoon matinee when nobody is there, DO NOT film on a Saturday evening when the movie theater is packed full of people. Just a tip.

Sound: typical of a Cam

Video: half the screen is covered by some guys back and shoulder."

,stylishirish,2007-12-22T22:30Z,"bajsjojje  ---- it also could be that you have a file association problem... in other words, at some point you told windows media player to open the .torrent file extension and it has remember that and will continue to do that by default until it is changed.... try right clicking on the torrent files and changing the properties to open with your bittorrent client.


and dont watch this -- i got it at first and couldnt do it ..  i am glad i waited for the good souls that got their hands on an actual dvd screener... the difference is day and night in terms of quality"
