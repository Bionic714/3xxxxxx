320KBps Digital Release (December 14th 2007).



The entire release comprises of 3 tracks, but we're not really concerned with the more smoothed out progressive lazy break production of the Sunset Mix.

We want it bouncy and we want it slick.  It's got drive, it's got atmosphere and it's got beautiful little bleep-and-bloopers.

For me, the Original Mix really is the winner here, which employs a little dirty tech transition, but I'm also very much enjoying the consistency and sweetness of the Moon Mix.
