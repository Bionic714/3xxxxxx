,LLayr,2007-12-21T13:49Z,"nice sentiments, however 'ordinary' copyrite owners are well aware of the fact that the more illicit downloads the more hard sales of originals,
and the ones makin the biggest stink are gennerally copyrite managers and thier stooge 'artists' who see an opportunity for new income streams but aren't/weren't prepared for those markets.  i can sell you 'my' poster on a website at a rate of one a day, but i'll call unholy hell down upon the head of the guy who invents going door to door who sells 6 times what i do by giving away freebies!

if you check into it you will see that 'trailers' and 'articles' are often MUCH more aggressively defended than the finished work! you see, even if something is 'free', that doesn't mean that it isn't copywritten and intended for use by the original holder for ONLY the use(s) that he has chosen.  could be he has a plan, or he could even be under a contract to a third party.
thats part of the reason fanedits and spoofs are way kool, because they are sufficiently derivative, extremely familiar, and often more entertaining, Wierd Al RUL3Z!
tx 4 the download"
