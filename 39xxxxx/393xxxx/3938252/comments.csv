more than two comments"
,N0B0d7kn0Ze,2008-08-29T09:50Z,"After downloading this torrent, I also found the missing pilot episode, not on GUBA, as the info.txt states (404 Not Found), but from UseNeXT.

I have added it to the collection and am now re-seeding the whole thing at:

Also, for anyone who might be interested, I've found a torrent of some Rumpole BBC radio plays, but it's not on TPB, at least, I can't find it.

I got that torrent from:

http://fenopy.com/torrent/Rumpole_of_the_Bailey_by_John_Mortimer___BBC_Radio___SeymourDAC/MTEwMTAyMw==/download.torrent

It's downloading now.  When it completes, I'll re-seed it to TPB."
