Good luck
Thanks for upload."
,VeganFreak,2008-03-07T17:35Z,"dentman - you're right there is a glitch in the middle of this movie... I didn't rip it myself, but if i can find a better version i will upload it and close this torrent. 

For people watching on their computer you can use the timeline to skip the second it glitches in case your player doesn't keep playing it. It plays the whole thing fine for me but if i use a different player it doesn't always skip the part in the middle. This is a great movie though and it likely won't skip for most people (again, if it does just move your movie timeline over a second or so and it should keep playing normally)."

,sharphu,2009-08-03T00:09Z,thanks for sharing it
,VeganFreak,2009-08-12T16:48Z,"If I get a hold of this DVD, I can try to re-rip it. Until then, you guys are stuck with this glitched copy that I had downloaded years ago. Volunteer rippers are welcome. The movie is still watchable, but yes there is a glitch in the video, which may cause the video to momentarily freeze. You could always rent or buy this movie, too... but if you're too cheap for that, and too lazy to make a contribution, and you want to watch this movie, then you can settle for this torrent.

I don't think there's any major problems with the audio, though experience with this movie may vary from one video player to the next. Windows Media Player on XP handled the glitch alright for me."
