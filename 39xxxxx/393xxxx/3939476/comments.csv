,Sonic5688,2007-12-19T12:00Z,I'm taking requests for other multidisc games as well. Just post your request as a comment.
,Galagher,2007-12-19T19:42Z,"Sorry for previous post, is this U region?"
,Sonic5688,2007-12-20T00:11Z,All my releases are NTSC-U unless stated otherwise.
,Kaneco,2007-12-21T00:15Z,"It would be nice, if you did the same with Resident evil 2. :D"
,LaCosteMo,2007-12-21T18:06Z,it's nice but i have little errors with the sounds and it woulde have been a killer uploud when u did the menu complete like this clip but if you read it and u know a sollution plz tell me thx a lot btw http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7nqIgPl5GI
,Sonic5688,2007-12-22T19:25Z,"LaCosteMo: People spend around half a second on the menu to select the game, I'm bringing you the game, I'm not promising anything flashy.


Kaneco: I'll have a torrent up for it before the weekend is over! Thanks for the request!"
,Sonic5688,2007-12-23T23:42Z,How about some of you mongoloids help seed a bit instead of downloading and not sharing?
,BoomBlasta,2007-12-25T23:38Z,if you could upload any of the psx Final Fantasies I would be really happy
,aLdeCh,2008-01-17T00:25Z,"when i play this on my psp slim with fw 3.80 m33-4, it plays beautifully except when snake is talkin on the codec the sound is all corrupted sometime, is it just me or this torrent is bad ? "
,hereticgod,2008-01-17T03:01Z,"does anyone have a copy of a psx game called ""The Hunter""? if so could you rip a .iso and up it? or even better could someone who knows more than me make a .pbp and up it?

Thanks. 

Xander."
,Sonic5688,2008-01-26T19:27Z,"It's not just you, it's not my torrent. The PSP does not play this game perfectly, you just have to deal with it."
,invokez,2008-02-03T22:14Z,just so you know ahead of time it doesn't work on 3.90 m33 you need to run pops on 3.71
,Sonic5688,2008-02-05T06:41Z,Thank you for the heads up invokes.
,eggghead,2008-02-27T14:37Z,"I've gotten the second disc working on 3.90 M33, However the first disc is still a mystery, Will have to wait for the next popsloader release methinks ;]

Just a heads-up for anyone planning on updating beyond 3.72 =p"
,Sonic5688,2008-03-08T00:27Z,"egghead, this works fine on 3.90 m33 if you run it in 3.71 pops. This is what I've done. If anyone wants a full 3.90 popsloader uploaded, please let me know in a comment and I'll do so."
,Dahkie,2008-03-08T09:48Z,"Hey Sonic, yeah could you upload a full 3.90 pops if its not too much hassle?  Thanks!"
,Dahkie,2008-03-08T20:20Z,Actually nevermind.  Using 3.71 pops lol.  thanks anyway.
,Dahkie,2008-03-08T20:23Z,"WOO! got it working!  So pumped!  Thanks sonic, i'll help seed a bit lol."
,Sonic5688,2008-03-12T03:47Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4075732/Full_3.90_working_popsloader_for_PSP


There it is. Enjoy it! Works on 3.80 and 3.90."
,F3nya,2008-03-16T14:18Z,"Sonic, does this your MGS release has audio struttering during cutscenes and codec calls?"
,Sonic5688,2008-03-16T22:28Z,"Yes it does. This is due to Sony's firmware, not my conversion."
,gabya,2008-03-27T21:45Z,"this kicks ass!

is there any way you can make a final fantasy VI convesion?

sincerly Gab"
,gabya,2008-03-28T16:28Z,"srry, i mean FF anthology :)
could u do that plz?"
,Sonic5688,2008-03-30T04:33Z,both on one file?
,gabya,2008-03-30T21:06Z,"oh yeah,theyr two diffrnt games... my bad :)

could you make one for each?"
,Sonic5688,2008-03-30T23:52Z,"I'm sort of only doing md conversions right now, so i could convert both games into one eboot if you would like. Doing single disc conversions is easy enough that monkeys can do it so I don't really see a point in it."
,gabya,2008-03-31T15:02Z,ok... coul you make ff7 or 8 then? they are multi disc games and kick ass :)
,Sonic5688,2008-04-01T12:38Z,Will do.
,lawrencets,2008-04-14T00:10Z,"The game freeze after playstation logo, and still a black screen. Some help?"
,Sonic5688,2008-04-14T07:43Z,Use my popsloader to load the game with 3.71 pops.
,Sonic5688,2008-04-24T06:18Z,"Yeah, thats a nice video, but it's not the trailer."
,n00b13t,2008-06-15T08:48Z,"Sonic, I can't get pass the disc checking process when you start a new game. I have your popsloader and 3.90 m33-3"
,Sonic5688,2008-06-15T09:19Z,load this with 3.71 pops.
,n00b13t,2008-06-15T11:52Z,"Pops371, pops380 and pops390 don't work, i tried them."
,Sonic5688,2008-06-17T21:11Z,You're doing something wrong. I beat the entire game using pops 3.71.
,playstationlibrary,2008-06-23T20:33Z,"Peps with problems your probably in  the uk using pal not NTSC-U Witch this torrent is (like me) so download popstation 3.71 and then open the ""EBOOT.PBP"" with popstation Now tick ""Recompress EBOOT""  now tick ""fix screen height"" and click ""GO"" Trans fer to psp if it doesnt run redo it selecting ""fix graphics"" as well as ""fix screen height"" 

If this dont work 4 u i dunno wot is wrong wid it"
,Sonic5688,2008-06-24T20:16Z,"Yeah, all my releases are NTSC-U unless stated otherwise.

Thank you playstationlibrary."
,youngbuck101,2008-06-26T21:40Z,ok so i beat the first disk and u have to put in the second one how do u run it cuz i turn it off and and try running it then it just tell me to put the first disk back in 
,Sonic5688,2008-07-03T02:37Z,Hit home and use the Change Disc option. You must be running popstation 3.71 or higher for the option to be there.
,fullautosniper,2008-08-13T23:12Z,The game works well but I have one question. What is the code on the CD case? Its a radio frequency for one of the characters in the game.
,Sonic5688,2008-08-17T07:41Z,140.15 is Meryl's codec number.
,skier354,2008-09-30T23:00Z,"here is mine that has the cool menu :)

,Kurosaki_Ichigo99,2008-12-31T18:35Z,I HAVE A QUESTION!!!! i have 4.01 m-33-2 will it work on it??
,sodimizerTYLER,2010-01-06T15:06Z,SO this is simply a psp game? theres no way to format it to run on a computer?
