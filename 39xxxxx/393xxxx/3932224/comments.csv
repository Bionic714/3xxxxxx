[T],d-l33t3,2007-12-20T17:06Z,"I can assure you this isn't a virus. If you download it you find the installer for dark basic pro 62 trial and the crack for converting to the full version.
Please report back once you have downloaded and verified this so others arn't put off by your comment."
,napalm22,2007-12-20T20:07Z,"I just tried it, it works. Its just the trial + crack. So its not the full version, I think. I checked all the other torrents though, and this is the best option so far."
[T],d-l33t3,2007-12-22T00:39Z,"'So its not the full version, I think.'
Don't worry. It is the full version. You get full functionality from the options and the language. Nothing is blocked, water marked or restricted."
,deaddylan123,2007-12-28T16:58Z,"PLEASE SEED.

,Dol_Cheep,2008-01-05T17:19Z,"Ohhh... Please this is crap, 10MiB dam dude. It should be like 300MiB... Adware i think."
,helltoast,2008-01-10T01:49Z,"It's not, and this isn't 300MB, the old torrent is that size because he have a lot of other programs that aren't listed. Still, this is only a trial version. I'll try to upgrade and crack it, if it works I'll post here."

,FirebirdX,2008-12-11T22:20Z,"I'm having trouble getting this to work.

Do I install the trial, then replace the files?
Or do I install the trial, then activate it for 30 days, then replace the files?

Neither seems to be working, as I keep getting the stupid waterwark."
,x86man,2008-12-29T23:28Z,I have tried everything i can think of and still get an error concerning DBProImageDebug.dll.  WTF should I do?
,skillerzwarez,2009-01-27T12:50Z,"This isn't the ""full"" version it's just the trial. Why the fuck post this when you can get it off their website? Learn to crack you dumbass."
,RevenantUK,2009-03-29T23:47Z,I have an older version that I can rip and upload if interested. Does not support DX 10 but is fully working and CD sized.. Let me know.. Cracks and updates included

,jaiskorpio,2010-05-08T15:33Z,"For those who don't understand how to do this, I've just downloaded using LimeWire, and extracted both the zipped files to my Desktop.

I then run the db_pro_6_2_trial installation, and then copied and pasted the 2 applications from the 62crack folder into the Compiler folder (Programs->The Game Creators->Dark Basic Pro Trial->Compiler) and run Dark Basic from the shortcut on my Desktop. There's nothing saying it's a trial, so I assume the crack worked.

I'm going to have a bash at it now, I used to program in BASIC on the Spectrum +2, Atari ST and Amiga 600 so have some knowledge. Good Luck."
,jaiskorpio,2010-05-08T16:23Z,"Actually, I was getting errors when running the example projects, so I tried to research the error on Google, and found a FREE version of Dark Basic Professional - the only difference apparently is that it has ads on it, (I'm presuming not on your finished games!) But it's free so what the hell!
