Crowd and clapping noise have been left in to keep the whole
feeling of the show.

Ripper Notes:
Well, here's another source. It's still a little distant, but
closer, and better quality than the first source that was released
(slowburn). Lots of credit goes to these tapers for this show and
sources. I'm sure there's a lot more source's coming in the
future. But for now, here you go.
