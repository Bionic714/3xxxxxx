,lee369,2007-12-18T15:02Z,Thank you. Thank you for the information you supplied. Wish everyone took the time to do this.  It's a shame that no one else has taken the time to say thank you.

,60E,2007-12-20T01:35Z,"Hey mester..
Takker for dit store arbejde !!
Og, ikke mindst fordi du skriver hvordan ""jeg"" som computer spasser skal brænde materialet når det er downloadet !!  R E S P E K T !!
(Og ja, det er faktisk ment som en ros, og IKKE som en sarkastisk bemærkning !!)

Med venlig hilsen (+ Glædelig Jul)
Erik"

,mahko_uk,2008-01-05T15:47Z,"Hello there - i need some sort of file converter which i can change the format from say ..   .avi to Video_TS so i can burn it onto a DVD - ive downloaded a few programs but they dont do the trick, any suggestions ? please let me know, thank you."
,bonden81,2008-01-06T11:52Z,Can t you or anywone fix episode 1-5 from season2 whit swedish subs that would be great 
[T],despo1ler,2008-02-05T16:17Z,"thanx for the upload, have had 1 of your compilations b4 and was very impressed.

 To Mahko_uk try winAVI video convertor, will convert almost any format to almost any other format, there are different versions of it but I find the 7.1 version easiest for my purposes, if the 1st version you try doesnt suit you try a different 1, there are plenty of copies available in torrents on this site"
