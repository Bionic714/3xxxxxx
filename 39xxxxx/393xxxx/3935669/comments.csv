I like this movie, kop Khun maak, krup!"
,chelseatops,2008-01-30T05:04Z,"The download included this file - ""utorrentpartfile_53B43D84.dat"" When I click on it I'm told Windows cannot open it. Do I need to use this file? If so, how please?"
,chelseatops,2008-01-30T06:05Z,Anyone know why only 1.03GB has been downloaded instead of the advertised 1.31GB?
,bongii,2008-02-01T14:02Z,"Thanks for the movie! 

I adjusted an english subtitle to fit this 2cd version and uploaded it at:
http://depositfiles.com/en/files/3335048"
[V],poothaijaa,2008-02-01T22:02Z,"I don't know why you get that file.
first 2 files (cd1, cd2) are real movie.
(687.33, 372.09 mb)
the last file is behind the scene (279.85mb)
if you complete first 2 files that good enough for movie."

,chelseatops,2008-02-05T02:21Z,"bongii, how do you do that please?"
,bongii,2008-02-08T21:25Z,"-- chelseatops --
I used a free-ware program called Time Adjuster. I downloaded the subtitle from allsubs.org and used the functions split, syncronize and convert in Time Adjuster. Just google it and you'll find the program."
