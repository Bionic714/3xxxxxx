,scottyarch,2007-12-14T18:36Z,"Serial number is not necessary. EasyWMV releases a full version for people to download when they pay, no serial number needed."
,dontsteelwarez,2007-12-14T19:25Z,I prefer the following sollution which is completely free but one of the best i've seen up to now. Its easy to use and produces very good encoding quality: http://www.squared5.com

Not sure where you got the idea MPEG Streamclip is completely free, as that is not the case, technically speaking anyway. To convert WMV in Streamclip you must have Flip4Mac WMV Player Pro installed. Having said that, Streamclip is an excellent encoder, and the one I use most frequently"
