Convict killer , the subs are missing."
,mistertpitydafoo,2007-12-19T02:04Z,Subs are missing from Convict Killer? I could've swore I ripped subs. They should be hard encoded. If they aren't then I'll gladly create a .sub file for it. Just let me know whenever there's a problem and I'll gladly give you subtitles. I assume everything is perfect when no one takes the time to say thank you or to say there's a problem.
,mistertpitydafoo,2007-12-19T07:31Z,"subs have been upped

,mistertpitydafoo,2008-01-07T02:04Z,"Current seeders and downloaders, please seed when you finish for others. As of today I no longer am supporting this torrent. I have to remove the file to clear space for the next movie to upload. It's been over two weeks so hopefully everyone who wants it has it. PLEASE SEED to keep it alive as long as possible!"
,taojonesin,2008-07-06T01:29Z,"Hey everyone, I'd be happy to seed this if I can get the full copy!"
