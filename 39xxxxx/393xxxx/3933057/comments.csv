,z4rd,2007-12-17T19:26Z,"changes english dub into 
original japanese"
,stassano,2008-01-13T08:40Z,"only use this patch with http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3931754/Final_Fantasy_XII_USA_UNDUB of course... and if u don't have it yet please get it... it is SO much better than the English version. You could always be a good boya and buy the English version, download the un-dub and feel happy because you didn't pirate ;-)"
,yozbaby619,2008-02-06T05:14Z,there are missing sound in some cutscene even after patching :(
,Scotchy49,2008-04-15T17:36Z,"Thanks, I've got the game in full english but would like to redo it with japanese voices. 

But, I downladed both your 2 torrents, patched and then burnt the iso after patch and... :

It seems that several voices are missing, expecially on 1/3th of cut-scenes. Subtitltes are there, but no voice. 

Good work though !"
,Hewlett,2008-04-15T23:21Z,"waha, fluffy kitty..
if you're in touch with the great dude doing those undubs, could you ask wether it's possible to create a patch to PUT THE CONTROLS BACK TO THE JAPANESE ONES for FFXII ?
(swap cancel/select basically)
Thanks a bunch..
I'll try to find more ways to contact fluffy kitty in the meantime.."
,trippay,2010-05-21T12:15Z,"yeah this one's a good effort but there are still quite  a few cutscenes with voiceovers completely missing -- the 'story' ones are all there, but many mid-quest ones are missing."
,Death214,2010-08-07T12:27Z,I will seed as well.
