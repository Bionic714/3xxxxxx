  Seems I overlooked the Quickening special attack voices in the
  original release.  This patch will replace them with the 
  Japanese.

  I didn't realize xdelta (http://code.google.com/p/xdelta) was so
  robust for patching binary files with structural changes.

  Avoiding such changes used to be a major headache... in fact, I
  thank that is what caused the temporary voice problem I've seen
  people complain about in ToA.  I guess a proper patch this way is
  in order. :)
     
  Anyway, the included runme.bat script will invoke xdelta to patch
  from Final Fantasy XII UNDUB 1.0 to 1.01.
  
  Hackers/coders want to contact me?  Look for a fluffy kitty.
