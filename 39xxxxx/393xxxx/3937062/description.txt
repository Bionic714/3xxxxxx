This video course is much better than the Live class offered by TEFLINTERNATIONAL.

Thanks to Dave Hopkins for lending the DVD's.

Without his help this posting of the course would not be possible.

Having taken the live course and have watched all the videos, I tell you first hand LESSON PLANNING is the most important.
