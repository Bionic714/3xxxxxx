This book gives a good understand of what "naturals" think and believe.  A natural would be the man who is able to get with any girl effortlessly and make it look easy because it's natural to them.  Would you believe that they have beliefs such as:

"I Have the belief that I am better looking than I actually am.  I know that I am not as good looking as some men and better looking than others.  But I  know that I can walk into a room and walk out with another mans girlfriend"

"Women just want to use me for sex"
