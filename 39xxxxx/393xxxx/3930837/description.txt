documentary called "fallujah: the hidden massacre".  is very much self-explanatory if you can read, and deals with the issue of 'white phosphorous'.  hey, i don't know the whole truth, but neither do you.  at the very least...there is a cover-up.  what a world as the wicked witch of the east said in Oz.
