John Inverdale hosts a unique experiment, using the latest football technology, to find out how English football has really changed in the past fifty years. Through computerised analysis it compares every aspect of the FA Cup finals of 2007 and 1957 - the year of the dramatic encounter between Manchester United and Aston Villa. The results uncover a lost era of English football via interviews with the surviving members of the 1957 final and contributors including Tom Finney and Graham Taylor.
