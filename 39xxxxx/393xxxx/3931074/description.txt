Trivium is of my favorite metal bands of all time.  With this album, the music is just as hard, but the vocals mellowed out a little.  Its sounds a lot like Hetfield singing, which is awesome in my opinion.  I ripped it from an actualy CD, so quality is of the best.  Please seed for as long humanly possible.  Thank You.  SupermanGTR
