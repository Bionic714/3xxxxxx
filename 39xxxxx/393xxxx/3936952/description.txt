   Robert Neville is a brilliant scientist, but even he could not contain the 
   terrible virus that was unstoppable, incurable, and man-made. Somehow immune, 
   Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City and 
   maybe the world. For three years, Neville has faithfully sent out daily radio 
   messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. But he
   is not alone. Mutant victims of the plague -- The Infected -- lurk in the
   shadows... watching Neville's every move... waiting for him to make a fatal
   mistake. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one
   remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his 
   own immune blood. But he knows he is outnumbered... and quickly running out of 
   time
