,Thebooguman,2007-12-18T03:15Z,SciFi-Sumo.. If you have something to say about this movie great.All we need is more people telling us how great other movies are.If you want to advertise movies then maby you should get on a forum. Better yet? Maby you should advertise one of your uploads.I see you have Uploaded  Kyushu Basho 2007 12 times and you have 0 Leechers.If you think about it you would see that your wasting resources.Focus on maby uploading something worth wile jerk.
,dirtyodesertdog,2007-12-18T03:30Z,OH NO  Thebooguman has came out tonight.Looks like his first victim was the SciFi-Sumo I do have to say.I like your style booguman.PS and your on tract with these people who wast resources.People are losing the whole idea of leaving comments.Ive downloaded this movie and find it to be not bad at all.Ive seen better but way more junk. ZulaTookni  GOOD JOB Keep up the good work.
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2007-12-18T14:17Z,"To Thebooguman. I see you have NEVER uploaded a file. Get a life. I support TPB, do you? BTW, did anyone check out 28 days? Have you Bman? Same movie as IAM just way better and PERFECT quality."

,extremevalid,2007-12-20T10:30Z,"I reckon you should all check out the movie ""Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston.. Yup its real old but its the same fucking flick.. I only had to watch 40 secs of this film to see that.. Although I'll bet will smith lives and saves the day in the end of this version......... Still watchable though......."
