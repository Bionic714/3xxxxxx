This torrent originally was tracked by Demonoid before it went down. Although without a tracker, I managed to download the entire package relying on the DHT feature of Azureus. Since this is a valuable piece of software, I want to rescue the torrent by having TPB track it. This is my first torrent upload and I hope I will do it correctly. To those guys and gals who seeded this for me, thank you. If you`re still seeding this torrent, please add up the following to your tracker list:

I have successfully installed the software in this torrent. It`s working fine but I cant give you a definite guarantee as I have not yet *exhaustively* tested all features. Here is a link to the official product page for this software:
