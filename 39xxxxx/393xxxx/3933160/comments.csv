,NoMadValues,2008-01-26T17:42Z,"Thanks for the upload GrayWako. This torrent has a fast download rate. Average speed for me was 200 kb/s. Thanks. 

I am new to this still and would like feed back on how to seed this torrent.. Any help?? "
,NoMadValues,2008-01-26T21:37Z,"So, I was wondering if you might give the password to all the 7zip files???? It's kind of useless to upload something that is passworded and not give the password. Don't you think?"
,GrayWako,2008-01-30T06:58Z,"NoMadValues, you need not and should not be opening those 7zip files. Just run the installer to install the software.  Those 7zip archives will be automatically unpacked by the installer."
,suvendu,2008-02-04T08:52Z,"I want to know the edition of this software.
Professional or enterprice?"
,GrayWako,2008-02-04T16:53Z,I`m not really sure... I think this is the Professional Edition.  I hope someone else can verify the product edition of this torrent as I have not fully tested the features.  Most of my software projects are done in Delphi and I don`t have spare time to tinker with this software.
,suvendu,2008-02-05T07:54Z,"I have just finished the downloading & installed it successfully.This is a great piece of software,
thanx for seeding & many thanx to graywako
for uploading this torrent."
