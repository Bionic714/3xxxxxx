Tananas' music was and is revolutionary. I remember listening to the first album in between being tear-gassed by the Apartheid police inside our uni campus. the message of resistance can be heard in the strong, irregular, yet melodic sound of the drum. SA today needs a second round of revolutionaries and visionaries to wrest the control of our country from the middle class elite. WE WERE NOT VIGILANT enough - and we are paying the price - a lutha continua!"
