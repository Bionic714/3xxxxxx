,Puffin_Nugs,2008-01-10T23:04Z,timewarner and speed bone both on this torrent
,tsw_gnaget,2008-01-11T20:01Z,"Seriously I just get irretated on all these people wo just over react when they say "" Ohh worst movie ever, i just spent 2 hours of my life to nothing"" to movies that are simply OK.

Like there are other movies out there that are really bad and might deserve a comment like that but movies like this and lets take ""The Game Plan"" are normal movies which you watch and it was fun. Not extremely funny but as I said OK, and fun.

The people that say that this is the worst movie ever and rate it 1 star on imdb: How many movies have you actually watched!?"
,mannens34,2008-01-14T06:22Z,this movie is so funny ^^ so it worth to wait on this movie =) 
,ilovejolie86,2008-01-15T14:02Z,"RETARDS!

The FXG Team did not write, direct, or act in the movie. They cannot be blamed for poor plot lines and bad acting. They simply uploaded the file, which is perfect.

Comment on the quality, don't be a dick just because you didn't like the movie itself.

Nico - if the torrent is a true FXG torrent, it can be trusted. And Mr. Woodcock came out on 1-15-08 anyway, jackass.

FXG_team = aXXo ;)"

,warlockwizard,2008-01-21T06:22Z,"I think FXG is AXXO
Looking at both torrents.... they are layed out almost exactly the same. And.... Axxo only uploaded dvd releases...... same for  FXG. They never up a cam or screener.   my suspicion is they are the same person.  "

,RollOverDJ,2008-02-29T19:28Z,great movie!
,FoxMcWeezer,2008-03-04T06:52Z,Why does it say Horror / Thriller?
,Sprit_Shaman,2008-03-06T14:38Z,"Great Quality. Thanks FXG_team. I have d/l many releases from FXG and always a great D/l.

The reason we watch a movie is to pass a few hours in front of the tube with some snacks and maybe a partner. Whether the movie sucks or not is irrelevent, you didn't waste your time, you got what you wanted. Please do your homework before D/L a movie if you are afraid you may not like it. I could care less what Movie reviewers say THEY thought of the movie, I'm not them.

We need to keep in mind that we are recieving goods for which we did not pay. Beggars can't be choosers. Sure, sometimes I get a dud, but that's life. If I REALLY must have it, I go buy it or see it in the theatre. There are far too many posts at TPB with cussing and derogatory comments from people who basically are stealing. So you walk into a wal-mart, steal a dvd player, get it home and find out it doesn't work. What do you do? Go back to the store and rip the manager a new behind?

Come on people, this maybe a den of thieves and pirates, but even among us the has to be some form of civility. I see many posters asking real questions (Newbies mostly) and not getting real answers.

Be thankful for that which you recieve, comment on the quality or virus checks ect... and help out the next generation of D/L's.

Or die tryin'......."

,al1984,2008-03-13T03:58Z,"@Sprit_Shaman

Geez, you must be bored, but I agree,  there are some really crappy movies out this past year.  

Dude, this is 2008.  All newbie questions have been answered 150,000 times already, just google it.  If they cannot figure that much out, they deserve to be left in the dark."
