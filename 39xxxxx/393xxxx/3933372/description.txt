Episode 023: Colours, Colors and Dialogs

Meet the Gimp! is a weekly video podcast or tutorial about the Gimp graphics software from the viewpoint of a digital photographer. More information at http://meetthegimp.org

GIMP offers you 9 different ways to select a colour for foreground and background. I try to make sense of them. Perhaps it?s a bit too long winded? Please comment on that here or write me a mail. I need YOUR input for thinking about where to go in the next year.
