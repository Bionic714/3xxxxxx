,Hatecomplications,2008-05-06T23:25Z,"WTF!? Why hasn't anyone commented that the first 3 + songs are staticy? I played them on my MP3 player, I played them on on my PC. No other tunes that I have are full of static. Both skirgsk's download and anous's tunes are effected. Whomever ripped it first and those who modified the rip later should have their testicles removed!"
