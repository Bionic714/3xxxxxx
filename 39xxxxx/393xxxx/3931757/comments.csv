Everything, from the beats to the amazing level of detail, the flow and the sharp lyrics, is top-of-the-line-material. Download it, listen to it, take your time, and in due time, you will agree with me, that if you are to buy only one hip-hop album this year, this one is it. Great album, worth downloading, and even worth paying for."
