Studio recordings compiled from 2004-2007 to serve as some sort of "introduction" or a "greatest hits" package from yours truly. Also included is the new song, "Live Through Me." The production is a little crazy and ambitious, unlike whatever I put out for 2008 which will be stripped down and subdued. But track one is really the first song I wrote that made me feel like I had something worthwhile to contribute to the world of musical expression.

These are the tracks that have been praised sporadically by fans. 


THIS IS A COLLECTIVE FAMILY RELEASE!
