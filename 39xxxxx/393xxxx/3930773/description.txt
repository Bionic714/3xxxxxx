Documentary from 2005 called 'why we fight'.  the why is american imperialism seemingly starting as far back as 1945; though i've heard earlier.  at the very least, the average american has no idea what our foreign policy is, or the reasons behind our policies.  we dumb unfortunately.  i hope this angers you to action.
