,SkurrePurre2,2007-12-17T18:22Z,"Do u want this in dvdr? Download this release then: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3937519/Saw.4.2007.TELECiNE.REAL.CUSTOM.SWESUB.DVDr-TEAMSWEDEN
Btw, it's SWESUB on this but you don't must choose it. You can play this rip without subtitles! :)

- IT'S SAW 4!!! -"
,MisterKing,2007-12-18T12:56Z,"So this is NOT dvdr quality but avi. Seems a bit weird: take the iso, comvert it to avi and then convert it back again!"
,BusterK,2007-12-19T01:16Z,"No, these files are from DVDR quality not made by me, it takes several hours to convert avi's back, so I thought it would be helpful to those ppl whom would like to write straight to DVD or mount and watch these four movies. It makes sense when I did not have the DVD's in the first place. Regards to all. BusterK"
,ravi000,2007-12-19T17:17Z,Are you kidding? you have saw 4 too?

... and his 

(his, meaning BusterK ... oooh, BusterK, BusterK, like that's supposed to be impressive. no parent would name their kid 'Buster', and to adopt it as a nickname SCREAMS 'small-penisville')

only other torrent has 0 seeders, and 0 leechers, and the first comment in the list of 2 is him, saying 'Excellent quality even though I say so myself'. 

well, you'd have to say so, 'cause you're THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN FUCKING VERIFY IT !!!
