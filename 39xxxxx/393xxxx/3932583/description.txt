Hi there
I would like to share with you this program tested on Windows XP only, don\'t know about Vista

---------------------
QuickMap - ... an easy-to-use Moving Map for FS

FS2002/FS2004/FSX AI aircraft display 
ILS Profile Display 
Data Logging 
There\'s not much to say about this program and there shouldn\'t be too much to say about it... The basic idea is a very simple and effective Moving Map. One you want to use and has all it takes without being complicated and cluttered with features.  
---------------------
 
Till the new FSNav shows, I use quickmap as my FSX moving map.


Have fun!!!
