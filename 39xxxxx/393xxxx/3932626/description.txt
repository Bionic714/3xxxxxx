The contestants are people who have what they consider to be a viable and potentially very profitable business idea, but who lack funding.

They have around two hours in which to present their business ideas, although only a short section of this is shown on air, in which to pitch their idea to five rich businesspeople, the "dragons" of the show's title. They have, before the show, named an amount of money that they wish to get, and the rules stipulate that if they do not raise at least this amount from the dragons, they get nothing.

The dragons then probe the idea further, often revealing an embarrassing lack of preparation on the part of the contestants or uncovering troubling facts, and consequently rejecting the investment. It is common in a show to see five or six ideas and only one that attracts the dragons' money. In return, the contestant give the dragons a percentage of the company's stock, which is the chief point of negotiation.
