The most important would be directory/file naming conventions, consistently applied. Each of my own files (ebooks and papers) looks something like this: ""xxxxx####yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"".

Xs = Last name of lead author
#s = Publication year
Ys = Title and/or subtitle

Further, how much of this is freely available from the internet? If you could distinguish site rips and web ephemera from publisher-issued ebooks and high-quality scans, I'd be grateful.

It would also help if you would compress files that are ""of a piece"" -- say, any single Palmer Hall audio series, or the Interactive Qabalah HTML package.

There also appears to be some overlap between these megatorrents and early digimob releases. Can you put re-releases in a seperate directory clearly marked as such?

None of these comments diminishes my gratitude for your astonishing efforts to date."
[T],occultmobilization,2007-12-16T19:06Z,"""The most important would be directory/file naming conventions, consistently applied.""


Let's see - 1,459 files in this mega-torrent.  1,105 files in mega-torrent 2.1., and 1027 files in the original mega-torrent.  Mega-torrent 2.3 will be similar in breadth and size.

How much time do you think it might take to individually go file-by-file to re-name according to your preferred convention?  We re-name and organize in directories as best as we can, but if you have the free time to invest, why don't you volunteer?


""Further, how much of this is freely available from the internet?""


We attempt to limit irrelevant site-rips and effluvia, but what is irrelevant to you may be completely relevant to another.


""It would also help if you would compress files that are 'of a piece'""


Sounds entirely reasonable.


""There also appears to be some overlap between these megatorrents and early digimob releases. Can you put re-releases in a seperate directory clearly marked as such?""


As you will note in the info, this three volume set of mega-torrents consists of material not included in our original mega-torrent.  In other words, our mega-torrent releases consolidate reader submission digests and new content in DVD-sized chunks.  Managing seeds for dozens of torrent releases is a lot harder than a few consolidated volumes.  


""None of these comments diminishes my gratitude for your astonishing efforts to date.""


We appreciate your support.  We would also point out that every megabyte you upload goes to another student, just like you.


Namaste.

,speakr,2007-12-17T07:13Z,"I can see that the request for naming conventions was a tall order. FWIW, I'd never find anything in my collection if it weren't all labeled clearly and consistently. I just assumed that somebody on your side of things felt the same way WRT their own private collection and that I could capitalize on their efforts.

I'm not sure I can aid you in this, save to release my own carefully ordered collection at some point -- and I think I might just do that.

Props to the mob! Peace."
[T],occultmobilization,2007-12-17T23:21Z,"Are your comments a genuine plea for us to restructure our torrents because information cannot be found easily?
OR
Do you wish us to restructuring the torrents to reduce your personal overhead in merging our torrents into your library?


The problem is everybody has different ideas of how to organise a collection of books.  I have a directory for each broad topic (e.g. golden dawn) and a directory for each author.  The file name is less important in this organisational scheme.
The ?topic? is of course my subjective assessment. 

I also place a greater store in the meta-tags of the PDF file ? which for the books scanned by us you will notice will have author & title completed.  

I agree the digimob digests have minimal structure other than PDF meta-tags and file names.  But can you honestly say looking at the ?Mega torrents? there is no organisational structure?

,speakr,2007-12-18T10:18Z,"My request, unclear as it may have been, was for consistent naming on any scheme. I offered my own scheme only as illustrative, not exemplary.

To answer your disjunction, then, I'd say yes to both alternatives. I think that my request would be helpful to anyone who is not interested in your whole package. Indeed, who would be? You're obviously catering to a wide variety of metaphysical penchants."

[T],occultmobilization,2008-08-09T05:56Z,"There is no fatal error in this torrent.  It's been seeded non-stop since posting.  If you receive an error when trying to download, the problem is local.  Attempt using a different torrent client.

,Wesleypipes77,2009-09-07T19:51Z,"I may be a little late to the conversation as I see that the last post was over a year ago but I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate your contributions. Contrary to how some may feel I am more than happy to see such an abundance of knowledge to study. Although I am sure most everyone has thier own personal niche they prefer to focus on. My personal method is to study all paths yet follow only my own. 

The more knowledge the better! There is such a wealth of occult knowledge accumulated over time that it may take a lifetime or 2 to fully study and understand but the more I have available to me the better.
