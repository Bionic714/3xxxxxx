,babylaton,2007-12-15T03:02Z,is this pal or ntsc setup disc
,Barker91,2007-12-15T03:05Z,"all of them. you extract the file using WINRAR and then you choose your region. they are named NTSC, PAL or JAP"
,babylaton,2007-12-15T03:06Z,cheers mate will it be an iso sorry im a nooob
,Barker91,2007-12-15T03:09Z,yes. if you extract this file there will be 3 isos. do you have winrar and all that stuff?
,Barker91,2007-12-15T03:12Z,do you have wiikey?
,FriendlyDonkey,2007-12-15T03:25Z,"Hey, Barker, gotta question:
If I'm not sure what kinda chip I got, are there any risks using the update? Or, if I don't have a wiikey, it just won't do anything?
Thanks, bro."
,babylaton,2007-12-15T11:28Z,i got wii key i extracted the file and burnt the pal iso to dvd but my wii dosent even recognise it
,MasterTelia,2007-12-15T12:16Z,"hey barker

so ive got some probs with burning multiple GC games to 1 dvd5, so ive looked around for some time and i cant get a straight answer anywhere, only read something that you needed GCOS to get them working

btw. got a wii chipped with a wiikey"
,Barker91,2007-12-15T15:41Z,to friendlydonkey. if you run a update on you wii for the wiikey it will test if you have wiikey and if you can update it. if it fails then you should not update ;P  using the config on the wrong chip it will boot and it should not damage your wii if you change the settings there^^
,Barker91,2007-12-15T15:43Z,MasterTelia. you have to use a certain program. i can give you the link a soon as possible ;)

follow the link to get a Multi tool for your wii :)"
,Barker91,2007-12-15T16:02Z,"babylaton.  hmm. i don't know why that happens... it works for me perfectly.... remember you have to use IMGBURN and burn on a dvd-r NOT a dvd+r.. if you do this i recommend it will work or else your chip doesnt work or you haven't updated it.

,babylaton,2007-12-16T16:21Z,y do some games get recognised but then freeze and tell you to look at instruction manuall bla bla bla and how do i fix this problem
,Barker91,2007-12-16T16:47Z,Have you updated your wii with 1.9b?
,babylaton,2007-12-17T01:35Z,i updated to 1.9g dunno about b do i need to do both
,Barker91,2007-12-17T18:42Z,"The game is more likely to work if you use DVD-R and if you use DVD+R it wears on the wii's laser and you shorten the lifetime of your wii. you also make your wii hold more if you burn at 4x speed. no more, no less. 4x is the best for the wii's laser to read."
,babylaton,2007-12-18T15:33Z,barker your the best everythin workd gr8 for me know thanks for your help
,Barker91,2007-12-18T16:30Z,No problems mate ^^
,babylaton,2007-12-21T00:01Z,barker you about i need your help asap
,babylaton,2007-12-21T00:04Z,i got maio galext my wii is uptodate with 1.9b and 1.9g when i put mario in it prompts a update from nintendo but warns of dameging wii should i do it
,babylaton,2007-12-21T01:31Z,i done the update and it didnt damage wii yippie but smg still freees black screen after disc is recognised and says problem with disc
,Barker91,2007-12-28T17:11Z,"then it probably is wrong with the disc. you should try to reburn the program or set ""Region Override"" to ON using the setup disc for you wii:)"
,Barker91,2007-12-28T17:12Z,how do you meen purplerose? should i make a DVD and send it to you ?? or should i make an ISO with all the updates and stuff and setup discs for you and post it?
,MasterTelia,2008-01-02T15:01Z,"hey barker

need your help again, lol

if you would just come on msn"
,dedsnags,2008-01-31T07:23Z,I have a Wiikey w/D2B chip and updated with 1.9g disc which made my smg play just fine.  I then got a snes emulator disc from here and burned that and in the menu I remember it asking to do some patch and like a jackass I did it and the game worked great.  So did several others after that.  However the next time I put smg in my discs would no longer read.  Not even my ninetendo wii sports game.  Nothing.  Still have access to all menus however and can play every game I downloaded from wii store and the internet browser works.  Just wont read discs.  Can you please help.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated and please understand I really am not too good with all this.  Thanks.
,Barker91,2008-02-03T16:15Z,you semi-bricked your wii. it means that you updated it with the wrong version of firmware. use the recovery disc
,crazyk3vin,2008-02-04T02:51Z,"i did try updating the wii using wii key update 1.9g and it didnt work. was i suppose to do that after i use the wii setup 1.3? maybe thats why i got the error? everytime i load up the wii setup 1.3 and turn on region override on, and reset console , the region overide is turned back off by itself."
,dedsnags,2008-02-05T23:28Z,Tried recovery disc and it did not work since it will not read any discs.  Tried reformatting wii memory did not work.  Is the dvd drive done and if so where do you get a new one?  Please help.  Thanks.
,shaheed013,2008-02-10T20:57Z,"Need help!!

,toco123,2008-02-20T17:45Z,"Help, I downloaded GCOS config 1.3 for the Wiikey in a desperate hope to get the 80% of my wii backups that don't work.. It did fix the gamecube games tho. However, when I turn on region override on, and reset console , the region overide is turned back off by itself?? "
,Delgo,2008-03-13T21:33Z,"This absolutely works, when you update your Wiikey to 1.9G you can no longer launch 1.3 config disc. This file helps to launch it. 

Still everytime i enter the 1.3 options it says that regionfree is OFF, when i turn it ON is it on until i enter meny the next time or cant it make changes ? "
,Barker91,2008-03-24T17:30Z,"to toco123. the regionoverride shows ""off"" because it always shows the default settings. so regionoverride can be on even if it shows it is of. just set the regionoverride to ""on"" and save changes. done :D:D"
