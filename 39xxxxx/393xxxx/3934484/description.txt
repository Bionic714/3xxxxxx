Dubfire - I Feel Speed (UNKLE Remix 2007) [Progressive House]


Ok... so my schedule reconstruction is going well enough so far I suppose... seeding is good enough and I am thankful.

The Jeff Samuel's gone a a bit mental, which was expected, but I'm not very impressed with the reaction to my SCSI-9 posting so far... please remember my friends, it does you no harm to keep an open mind.. why not give it a try?


I posted UNKLE remixed by Dubfire, and the crowd is still going wild.

It is with great pride and joy I now bring you Dubfire remixed by UNKLE... and I am going all out bonkers over this release.  Don't forget that the excellent Booka Shade remix is also on the schedule should you have somehow missed it!



There is no discogs entry for this release as yet.
