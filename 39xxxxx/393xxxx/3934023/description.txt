Tech Notes

SHNs decoded to wave and Wavmerge was used to reassemble the 
tracks back to 1 long wave.  CEP2.0 was used to align & synch 
all three sources (time compress and expand).  CEP2.0 was
used to preform the multitrack mixdown of all three sources.
This is a 60% SBD, 25% AUD1, 15% AUD2 mix.

Notes

A relatively dry PreFM (SBD) and two nice sounding AUD sources
were all recorded on this magical night.  The result is an 
excellent mix, justifying the blending of the three sources to 
breathe some life back into this very famous show.  

All three sources were pitched differently, the SBD being the 
sharpest while both AUDs where somewhat flat.  I used the SBD 
as my master timeline and synched both AUDs to it. AUD1 on 
average had to be pitched up about .24 (24 cents) to achieve 
pitch correction.   AUD2 on average had to be pitched up about 
.21 (21 cents) to achieve pitch correction - 1.00 being 100 
cents which is a semitone.   I did not reference A=440 as I 
wanted to leave the speed of the SBD alone.  It is very close 
to A=440 though.

d1t05 The PreFM (SBD) source was missing 3.875 seconds between
The Great Gig In The Sky and Money.  Both AUDs were trimmed 
accordingly to match. Some volume adjustments and quick cross
fades were preformed making these edits completely smooth and 
most likely totally undetectable.  What was missing was one
cha-ching of the cash register sound effect.

d1t08 The AUD2 source cuts at 41:07.515 and is missing 1:36.330
of Any Colour You Like.  I used the AUD1 source to fill this
hole.  The patch source was EQed, volume adjusted with a small 
amount of limiting.  All in an effort to try and closely match
the sonic properties of the missing AUD2 source.   These edits 
are smooth and most likely undetectable.

d1t10 The PreFM (SBD) has a long portion of cheering and 
tuning prior to the encore Echoes.  Unfortunately this was 
missing from both AUD sources.  The SBD was trimmed to match 
and all 3 sources have multiple edits, mixing and crossfades 
to keep the flow between the last song and the encore sounding 
as natural as possible.  The result was good and this is smooth 
and natural sounding edit.  Although it is left sounding like
Echoes was preformed very soon after the DSOTM potion instead 
of as the encore.

---------------------------------------------------------

Notes on the Source Material

I love the fact that all 3 sources were raw.  It doesn't
sound or look like any noise reduction, EQing or any other
DSP (digital sound processing) was done.  It was an honor 
and a privilege to work on this project.  It was also very
very cool to be sitting at my workstation, working on 3 
impressive recordings, in such beautiful condition, 33 years 
after the fact.  Incredible.

SBD
Very clear, well balanced and a clean PreFM source.  However,
this is much more like a straight SBD feed than a PreFM.  
Many PreFM sources I have heard have some element of a live 
feel.  Either b/c there is a "live mic" feed (a microphone 
used to capture the sound of the room) or a similar technique
where a microphone is used to capture the crowd, i.e. cheers, 
etc.  On this recording the only way the room or crowd is 
heard at all is b/c it is being picked up thru the mics set 
up for the vocals.  The result is an extremely dry and flat 
sound making this an ideal source to use in a mix with an 
AUD recording(s).

AUD1
I find this to be the better of the two AUD recordings used
in this mix.  Without a doubt this recording is made much
closer to the PA stacks than the AUD2 recording.  This
recording is very well balanced with good dynamic range
and little to no hiss.  The low hiss and limited speed
fluctuations tells me that this is indeed a digital recording
made off the masters.  A very interesting note is I could not
find any evidence of a tape flip.  Was a quick flip done and
a small patch used from AUD2?  Maybe.  Was this recording on
a 120 min cassette or possible a 60 min Reel?  Maybe.  The
only disappointment with the AUD1 recording is that it is
missing the encore, Echoes.

AUD2
Although not as punchy and clear an audience recording as 
the AUD1 source, this is still a very good recording.  Made 
from further back in the venue this recording also has low 
hiss and limited speed fluctuations and tells me that this  
is digital transcription made off the masters.  A long tape 
flip lasting 1 min and 36.33 seconds in Any Colour You Like 
is the only missing portion.

---------------------------------------------------------

Notes on the Sound

The PreFM (or SBD) source sounds great.  Conceptually all I 
was trying to do here is to add some dimension to the SBD, 
which is dry but very crisp, by using the ambience of the AUDs.  

The PreFM sounds much more like a studio recording than a live 
recording.  I have a hunch that a completely different feed was 
setup for the BBC recording than the mix that was sent over the 
PA.  Evidence for that is found on sound "Sample_6".  On that 
sample you can clearly hear that reverb has been added to the 
vocals on the PA mix but is not present on the BBC recording.  
Not just reverb but other effects are lacking throughout, leaving 
an unnatural tone to Gilmour's guitar among other shortcomings.  
His sound is noticeably flat and completely lacking that warm, 
wonderful tone that is the trademark of Gilmour.  This is a huge 
reason why I find this matrix mix to not only be a much better 
representation of this live show but also a more pleasant 
listening experience than the dry BBC mix. Your mileage may vary.

---------------------------------------------------------

Notes on the Sound Samples

Sample_1

This is just a clip of the matrix mix to give you an idea of
what to expect.  Note the subtle changes in sound over the
straight SBD.  The extra warmth and lingering notes from the
guitar and the additional "thump" to the bass.

Sample_2

This sample gives you a quick A/B comparison to the straight
SBD.  You'll hear a 10 second clip of the SBD followed by a
10 second clip of the Matrix. 10 seconds SBD, 10 seconds Matrix
and so on.  Four 10 second clips of each for a total 80 second
clip.  I gave you a portion that gives the most drastic sound 
difference btwn the 2 sources.  This quiet portion allows for
more of the AUD to get into the mix.  This is also a spot
where the crowd gets into the song and has a "clap along"
going. (There are no crossfades and transitions are abrupt.)

Again, this clip was used b/c the sound difference is the
most apparent during this particular portion.  The majority 
of the recording you will only hear more subtle sound 
differences btwn the SBD and the Matrix.  The difference in 
tone and the overall "size" of the recording being the most
noticeable differences to the PreFM (SBD) source.  The Matrix 
has a much bigger feel to it.  This is even more obvious 
on the 5.1 Surround Sound version.

Sample_3

Here you will find the 3 second edit I made between The 
Great Gig In The Sky and Money.  The original PreFM master 
edit was so transparent and seamless on the SBD source that
I opted to duplicate the edit on the AUD sources rather 
than patch the 3 seconds missing on the SBD source with
one or both AUD recordings.  That patch could only result
in a jarring source change and be very distracting in my
opinion.  So what we have here is the pleasurable listening
version versus the 3 second longer, complete version.  I
would bet that I am the first person in 33 years to even
know that 3.875 seconds is missing from the SBD.

Sample_4

Here you will find the edit preformed to patch the 1:36.33
missing from Any Colour You Like in the AUD2 recording.  
What you have here is a SBD+AUD1, 2 source matrix mix.  
Unlike the majority of this Matrix which is a 3 source 
SBD+AUD1+AUD2 mix.

Sample_5

This sample was provided to give you an idea of what the
Matrix mix will sound like as a SBD+AUD2, 2 source mix.
What's cool is between the patch on Any Colour and the
entire Echoes the listener really ends up hearing 3 
different Matrix mixes.  You get the main body of the
matrix as a 3 source SBD+AUD1+AUD2 mix.  Plus you get
the 1:36.33 during Any Colour as a 2 source SBD+AUD1 mix.  
And finally you get all of Echoes as another 2 source
SBD+AUD2 mix.  There is really 3 uniquely different
Matrix mixes found in this one recording.  However quiet
a bit of editing was done to make sure all 3 mixes 
sound damn close to the same.

Sample_6

The 30 second clip of the SBD is followed by the same 30
second clip of the AUD1 source.  Listen to the reverb on
Roger Water's vocals and how it is missing on the SBD
source.  This is easily identified on the vocals but is 
true throughout the recording.  The BBC recording is much 
different in how the vocals from the female backup singers 
sounded live too.  This is a big factor in why the tone is
so different on Gilmour's guitar on the SBD versus how he
sounds on the Matrix mix or both of the AUD recordings.

Notes on the Artwork

Included you will find a folder with 58 different pieces of
CD covert art that was made over the years.  The artwork
for this Matrix version are the separate JPEGs found in the 
main folder and not with the 58 JPEGs in the folder that is 
marked "misc artwork".  I would like to thank floydart.org
for their wonderful database of Pink Floyd CD covers.  I
would also like to thank the "Time In London" version for
the artwork that is the basis for what is included with 
this release.

Both DVD-Audio versions (the 5.1 Surround Sound and the 
24/96 Stereo) utilize a slide show of all the different 
artwork made for this same show over the years.  I love 
all the old artwork, some with the wrongs dates and funny
bootleg names.  Please note that the DVD-Audio slide show 
may or may not be functional with your DVD-A player.  This
is the case with my Dennon, which does the slide show for 
about 10 mins and the stops.  This has no effect on the
playback or the sound, only the visual portion.
