,Meeandonlyme,2007-12-17T04:36Z,How do I play and burn this film. VLC and powerdvd can't play it.
,touloused,2007-12-19T23:49Z,"fake?

I tried playing this in VLC and it reported that it contained 3 audio tracks but NO video tracks.  The audio tracks are all silent.

MediaInfo (http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en) reported the same.

Can someone else confirm that this is a fake..."
,motoxyz,2007-12-20T19:50Z,"Not fake.  Cyberlink PowerDVD (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3928491/Cyberlink_PowerDVD_Ultra_Deluxe_v7.3.3516___Key_%5BApp%5D.) plays the video.  I've not finished downloading yet, but i can see a very clear and sharp Universal Studios logo at the start of the film.  Opening up the 2nd of the files is a shot of Bourne."
,motoxyz,2007-12-20T19:52Z,"Meeandonlyme, don't download this file to burn to DVD.  That would be like taking a high quality MP3 and recording it to a cassette tape.  You may as well save yourself 3-4 days of download time and just get the cassette itself.  Only download this file if you're going to watch it on your computer or output to a 1080p HDTV.  Otherwise you're wasting your time."
,jax79,2007-12-21T04:05Z,"motoxyz is right.  I downloaded the whole thing, and had problems running the ts files with all my other programs.  Downloaded Cyberlink PowerDVD and it's working for me.
Thanks motoxyz!"
,touloused,2007-12-21T04:45Z,"my bad...

this is one of the first file types VLC has failed to play for me.  works fine with the proper s/w

thanks motoxyz"
,etherc,2007-12-23T05:24Z,"I've had luck just downloading the proper codecs (I believe it was the Matroska Pack that worked - maybe the CCCP pack... not sure anymore), and using Windows Media Player, Media Player Classic, and KMPlayer (all confirmed).
My problem is that there is no texted language as it says in the torrent's description.  Can someone please confirm that there are subtitles?  I've noticed on a couple occasions that there's that sound they play when words flash across the screen to tell you where the scene is (like CIA headquarters, etc.), but no text shows up so I don't know where it's supposed to be.  Also, I've noticed the Russian doesn't have any subtitles.
Can someone tell me if PowerDVD solves this or not?"
