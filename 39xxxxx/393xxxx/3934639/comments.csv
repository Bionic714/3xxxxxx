,ray_v_on,2008-03-15T13:30Z,"Dont know why , but when play on VLC player, the picture quality is not good as there are very noticeable jagged lines on one side of screen.

This happens to me on some aXXo files as well yet others said good quality.

Play on Windows Media player with XP codecs have no problem and the lines are more blended and easier to watch."
