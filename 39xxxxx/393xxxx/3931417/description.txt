Recorded in Copenhagen 2001 

Out of the swirling ocean of psychedelia in July 1967, Procol Harum?s A Whiter Shade of Pale hit the No.1 spot in many countries throughout the world. 
At the time it was a song that had instantly defined something new. 
This DVD captures the band performing many of their most popular tracks in Copenhagen, Denmark on 15th December 2001.
