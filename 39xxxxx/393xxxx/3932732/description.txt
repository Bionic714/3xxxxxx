Release Info

PLOT
Erik, Ryan, and Cooze start college and pledge the Beta House
fraternity, presided over by none other than legendary Dwight Stifler.
But chaos ensues when a fraternity of geeks threatens to stop the
debauchery and the Betas have to make a stand for their right to party.

EPiC's Notes

The scene that starts 1h19m5s into the movie is out of sync in all the
previous releases. This is because the 5.1 audio track on the DVD also
is out of sync. The 2.0 audio track however is fine and what we have
used to create our mp3.

In addition to this, the first two releases have two minutes of
copyright warnings at the end that shouldn't have been included (they
used the wrong PGC). RESERVED's release on the other hand is missing a
short scene after the credits that should have been included (our guess
is that they also used the wrong PGC and then trimmed too much).

Samples showing where the previous releases are out of sync have been
included.

Enjoy
