Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda are dead. Now, upon the news of Detective Kerry's murder,
two seasoned FBI profilers, Agent Strahm and Agent Perez, arrive in the terrified community
to assist the veteran Detective Hoffman in sifting through Jigsaw's latest grisly remains
and piecing together the puzzle. However, when SWAT Commander Rigg is abducted and thrust
into a game, the last officer untouched by Jigsaw has but ninety minutes to overcome a
series of demented traps and save an old friend or face the deadly consequences.
