A white-collar revenge fantasy in the vein of DEATH WISH 
(and based on a novel by the same author, Brian Garfield), 
DEATH SENTENCE ponders the nature and limits of retribution, 
asking if murder can ever be justified. Director James Wan (SAW) 
delivers a high-end exploitation film, complete with a washed-out, 
grainy appearance and some startling violence, but with complex, 
thrilling action sequences.

Cast: Kevin Bacon, Kelly Preston, Aisha Tyler, John Goodman, Matt O Leary.
