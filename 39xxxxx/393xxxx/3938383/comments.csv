Don't bother downloading this one... what a waste of 4 gig

,funtan_86,2007-12-19T01:15Z,"It's a little bit wierd that this full dvd release goes black aftar 22 min when UeRd8383's release of an .avi file dose the same at same time?

However I do agree with JamesCook that if you don't like this torrent simply just go to http://www.hilltophoods.com/shop and purchase it for all together au$41 (include shipping, non australian citizen), which was what I just did. I mean do you live in a shoe box or what????

PS: interferedwith; when it's free DON'T complain!!"
,JamesCook,2007-12-19T08:46Z,"Not sure how you guys have been able to burn the ISO when I've only uploaded 2 gig's?

And uerd8383 - if you've uploaded the undersize XviD rip of this DVD already, why would you bother downloading again?"
,Aroga,2010-05-31T01:57Z,I've been trying to find the dvd of this for sooo long. JB doesn't have it anymore and the GoldenEra store and Hilltop Hoods site store don't list it as for sale. JamesCook could you do me a favour and just upload a 700 MB avi of the main movie? I have a really small internet cap and a 4.3 GB torrent would tear it to shreds.
