IMDB write-up makes it sound a little better than the usual generic Shaw Bros. flick:

But, this divx ultra, I can't put this on a dvd without missing the subtitles, so just a friendly suggestion, you should hardcode the subs so if some of us would want to place them on disc we could, I never watch movies on the computer, always on TV. And once again a big thanks for your great titles."
,mistertpitydafoo,2007-12-19T02:06Z,I can easily rip it as a .sub or .srt file. Lots of programs such as convertxtodvd allow you to load one of those file and have subtitles in your movie when you watch it on tv. I just started using Divx ultra. I didn't know it would give some people problems with viewing the subs.
,olskool71,2007-12-19T06:38Z,"No big deal man, I wasn't complaining, it's just something new that I wasn't aware of that's all. You have a great collection and once again thanks for your time in upping these flicks!!!"
