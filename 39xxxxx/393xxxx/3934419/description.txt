Once again, I had trouble finding a LimeWire Pro 4.14.12 that wasn't zipped, password protected, and full of viruses. So, I got this one from a friend.

I don't submit infected files because like you, I want honesty.
When I post software, it's because I've tested it myself and at my
own risk to my files and computer.

This file was scanned with "Avast Home Edition 4.7 Build: Dec2007
(4.7.1098) Virus Database file 071211-0 updated 12/11/2007"



I scanned file before installation and computer scanned after installation. Both clean.
