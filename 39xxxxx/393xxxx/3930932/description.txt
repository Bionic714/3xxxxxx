Wipeout Pulse for PSP ... Needs firmware 3.71, or above to work.
----------------------------------------------------------------

The size of the game has been shrunk, by deleting unnecessary files from the .ISO.

--
--

What's been removed..?

UPDATE folder, and BOOT.BIN.

--
--

Everything else is left intact, including language files.

-----------------------------

Original .ISO size: 435 MB
Cleaned .ISO size: 327 MB

Compressed .CSO: 199 MB

-----------------------------

.CSO Level 5 compression was used.

Why not higher, such as Level 9...?

Because: Super-high compression does not always work well for everyone. 

And the size remained at 199 MB, even at Level 9...
