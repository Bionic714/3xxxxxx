,malcoriel,2009-04-22T13:23Z,"ShaddixXx, it's from russian game publisher Akella, so it's russian. At least i don't know that Akella sells non-translated games."
,malcoriel,2009-04-22T13:27Z,"Also, as i see in ÂľTorrent, it'is called Fahrenheit.lic.rus. I think it's quite better fact for proving that this copy of the game is russian."
