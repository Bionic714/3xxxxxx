"This is a CD of my favorite home demos from '92 to '07 featuring a lot of never heard before songs, a few covers, a few songs from my unfinished rock musical "Songs From The Black Hole" and my original demo for "Buddy Holly." 
- Rivers Cuomo


WEEZER's frontman & songwriter, Rivers Cuomo, releases a very special album of home demos. The song "Buddy Holly" became a Weezer song, but others remained in his personal vault. This collection is a true treasure chest for Weezer fans and fans of great Modern Rock songs.
