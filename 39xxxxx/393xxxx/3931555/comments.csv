,death734,2007-12-12T23:13Z,so is this a real HDTV rip of just the fullscreen DSR renamed like the last s01e02 you uploaded a few days ago?
,death734,2007-12-13T02:29Z,"* i mean ""or just a fullscreen DSR renamed..."""
,CTF_Release,2007-12-13T22:35Z,If you have seen this episode before why ask this questions? Download something else. This is made for Nordic users. HDTV or not? So what? Go fuck your selfe!!!! Fag
,CTF_Release,2007-12-13T23:05Z,"Hello death734. I`m very sorre that my files sre not good enough for you...... Ofcourse you have to critisise my uploads. I am a bad uploader and you are the best. Tell me if i am in your way... And i will delete my torrents right away. You are the best!!!!
Evryone death734 has no faults, he is the best on internet. Supoort him. Not me, i am bad"
,death734,2007-12-14T08:39Z,"calm down...
i downloaded some of S01E02 a week ago (or when ever it was when you originally uploaded it), previewed it and the resolution was 512x384 just like the DSR while hdtv should be 16:9 resolution. thats why i commented on here because if i'm going to download a rip called HDTV then i would prefer its a real hdtv rip"

""HDTV or not? So what?"" Wtf?!? Lame comment of the year award nominee...
Tag your releases properly. Too difficult for you?"
