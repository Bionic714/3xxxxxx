REVIEW by Amelia Raitt, eMusic
It's unlikely but it's true: in the final estimation, the sound of 2007 ended up being the sound of 1967. In the mainstream, Amy Winehouse won hearts and moved units by re-configuring the girl group sound till it reflected present-day debauchery. Just below the radar, artists like the Budos Band, the Pipettes and Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings kept fresh the sound of funk. California band Orgone belongs squarely in that latter camp ? their music is terrifically unfussy, big slabs of grizzled R&B, greasy as fatback and thick as a very particular kind of smoke. At their best, they recall the majesty of Sly & the Family Stone; opening track "Who Knows Who" is all bleary horns and broken-heart vocals, "It's What You Do" is a tight, itchy jam. There's still a riot goin' on, and Orgone is at the front of the crowd.
