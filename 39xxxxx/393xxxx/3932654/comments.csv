,Vertiphon25,2007-12-20T11:27Z,"Don't bother with this, go get MacFuse:
http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/

Install then restart.

Then get this:

The catacombae NTFS-3G plugin will automatically mount your NTFS partitions.  Install it, restart."
,desmomini,2007-12-24T01:33Z,"I installed it, and my ntfs disks could no longer be mounted.

I installed the trial version of paragon NTFS downloaded from their site, and it worked.

Uninstalled the trial, and again I can't mount NTFS partitions any more.

How do I uninstall this one??? help!"
,simonhojland,2008-01-01T22:28Z,"Don't bother downloading this, download http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3956898/Serial_Box_01-2008
and then download the trial from their website
http://www.paragon-software.com/home/ntfs-mac/download.html

It works, just tryed it. This one installs, and does not work.

,enyceexdanny,2008-05-05T02:44Z,"xalexas, the later versions (6.0, 6.5) doesn't exhibit this issue.

I used 6.0 for about a week, but it is still a bit unstable. But overall, the write speed is much faster than MacFUSE+ntfs3g.

I ended up uninstalling, and downloaded a trial for 6.5. And it's much more stable now.

While I'm on the subject, can anyone get the crack/serial for 6.5?

The serial number scheme seems to be different now. It doesn't accept certain characters.

Thanks =)"

,chimitron,2009-03-07T23:47Z,"¡¡¡ IMPORTANTE !!!

Como bien está comentando otra gente, no instalen esta aplicación. 
He probado otra versión de Paragon NTFS y funciona perfectamente pero, la versión de este torrent hace que no vuelvas a montar particiones NTFS y tengas problemas con los discos externos. 

NO RECOMIENDO ESTE TORRENT PARA NADA!!!"
