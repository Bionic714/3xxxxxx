_____________________________________________________________Summary__

The American biotechnology firm, Monsanto, has applied for a patent 
for pig breeding in 160 countries. The patent is for specific parts 
of the genetic material of pigs which Monsanto's genetic researchers 
have decoded. If this patent is granted, pig breeding would be 
possible with the approval of the company.

Farmers and breeders are naturally alarmed because these genes have 
long existed in the great majority of their pigs. Using DNA tests 
they can prove that there is no new invention in the patent 
applications but that, instead, granting this patent would be to 
allow a part of nature to fall into the hands of a single company.

Monsanto's influence on the patent offices is huge. If the patent 
is approved, money will have to be paid to Monsanto for every pig 
in the world carrying this genetic marker. This has long been the 
case for certain feedstuffs, such as genetically modified maize. 
Many farmers in the US have already become dependent on the company.
It is not merely a question of money, however, but also a question 
of the risk posed to consumers. In America, as in Europe, cases of 
infertility in animals fed with genetically modified maize are 
becoming increasingly common. No-one yet knows what effects such 
products are having on humans.
