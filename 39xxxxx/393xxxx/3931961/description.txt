Juan Serrano - Sabor Flamenco 1991
Flamenco guitar CD

"Ten dextrous fingers that often sound like twenty... there is more than finger dexterity in Mr. Serrano's playing. He commands a diverse panel of tone and color and applies it neatly. He plays with vigor and with beauty of phrasing." - The New York Times
