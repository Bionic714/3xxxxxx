,icescope,2007-12-22T10:57Z,Does this dvd have english subtitles?
,Rexje,2007-12-29T10:09Z,"Is this the Uncut (HK) version, with English subtitles?
"
,JohnTheMutt,2007-12-29T12:35Z,"Does not appear to be any English subtitles. Just a selection to play the movie and another to select scenes. Don't see a setup menu anywhere... Possibly ripped out? I don't know because so little documentation comes with this d/L.

The entire menu is in Mandarin...this is for Chinese audiences only. 

It is the unrated version however."
