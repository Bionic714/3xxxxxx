,Strohbie,2007-12-17T05:58Z,Rule!  Does anyone know the best way to drop this down to 2 tracks?

the delete button is in the top right corner"
,skoumoun,2007-12-25T19:58Z,You can recode to stereo using foobar and one of the dsp settings. It will fuse the channels to create a stereo signal. But then there's no way back if you don't keep the original.

,Strohbie,2011-12-21T08:59Z,Any chance you still have this?  I'd love to get ahold of another copy.

I'm connecting to this torrent to see if someone has it at 100%, so i can grab it and reseed it for as long as possible."
