The dvd was decrypted with DVDDecrypter onto the harddrive, and then all the data was manually extracted with PGC Demux. 

It took quite some time (3-4 hours), first because i didn\'t realise i had to decrypt so the extracted audio files were all corrupted in some way and made the audio player crash.
So second attempt was a success, thanks to method i have described.
It was also a bit of fun finding what were the correct audio files i was looking for.

Finally, here it is in its full quality and perfectness. I have included all the different variations of one song that could be heard. There were at first twice as much files, but many proved to be exact doubles after much careful listening.


If you are still reading, and i hope you are, it is important to say that you can easily listen to this using Foobar, the best audioplayer i know. I know some wish i can do a Flac encoding of this. I will do this when i find the proper method to preserve the 6 channels. Then it will be easier to play back, even though the total size will be much bigger with no quality improvement.

Stay posted, the FLAC Version will appear within 24hours i estimate! 



Thanks for reading,  thanks for buying NIN material,  nothing, specially this torrent, can replace the experience of watching this live dvd.


PS: If the second dvd contains different audio menus, i will rip this as well.
