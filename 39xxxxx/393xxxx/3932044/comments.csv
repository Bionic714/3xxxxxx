,DannOrly,2007-12-13T23:54Z,"For the record, I went through all of these. They work with VLC Media Player. 

And again. I sincerely apologize. I didn't mean to f' up everyones other torrent."
,DarkAng3L,2007-12-14T13:55Z,"These are the right ones and episodes 2,3 and 5 are working, good job Dann ;)"
,jjgaf,2007-12-15T01:55Z,"DannOrly?, I appriciate the fact you Seed this for us guys, but Seriously. Your an idiot. I downloaded the entire Series 2 To find out that I can't watch them because there Corrupted or what ever. I just hope you can justify yourself with some sort of Excuse that accountable. Wtf! "
,DannOrly,2007-12-15T09:01Z,"jjgaf, seriously, go fuck yourself with a rusty iron fork. Did I have to seed this shit? No. Did I have to pause everything else I'm seeding and let THIS AND ONLY THIS TORRENT seed for the sake of others? No. I made a mistake. I fixed it. Go chug bleach you fucking faggot, I don't see what you've contributed to the site. You have uploaded NOTHING. ZILCH. YOU, have contributed nothing. I have contributed greatly. 7/11 files still worked, and lazy fucksticks like you could have easily looked for the other 4 on this site and downloaded them individually. Man I fucking hate people like you, but luckily not eveyone is like you, and thus the reason I make this shit. Did I even have to make THIS one to make up for the last torrent I made? Hell no! I am under no moral obligation to do shit. Go take a long walk off a short pier and make sure not to breathe on the way down, dickbag."
,nsontag,2007-12-16T07:54Z,"Hey DannOrly, Just wanted to throw a quick thanks your way for the torrent. Not many people take the time to re-post if the first one doesn't work, that is if they upload at all. Don't let twat stains like jjgaff get to you. You're efforts are much appreciated!"
,DannOrly,2007-12-16T08:36Z,"Thanks man. I was in a bad mood that night, as you can tell haha. Oh well. But once again, thanks for the thanks =P"

,DannOrly,2007-12-24T12:04Z,"Twatwafer, All of the fucking episodes work. Download VLC Media Player if your precious Windows 'sucks at life' Media Player doesnt work. kthx"
,Suhfeli,2007-12-24T23:21Z,"Btw, VLC Media Player sucks. "
,Amsterdamfire,2007-12-25T01:16Z,"Hey DannOrly, thanks alot for this upload! The episodes all work like a charm with VLC! Happy Holidays :)"
,DannOrly,2007-12-25T21:27Z,"Not nearly as much as your mother, Suhfeli. Boosh!

,shaolin_shaolin,2007-12-27T11:24Z,"In season 1 there was 23 episodes, but here its just 11. Why???"
,digitalggs,2007-12-27T12:15Z,"cause we're still in the middle of season 2, only 11 episodes have aired.. http://imdb.com/title/tt0813715/episodes#season-2"

,LFC_11,2007-12-29T08:52Z,hey thanks for the up Dann good one!!!!!!
,DannOrly,2007-12-30T21:55Z,True that.
,Kon-Foozed,2008-01-01T14:49Z,"Thnaks for the torrent DannOrly, I'll seed it when finished because its in nice neatly named folder and not a stupid zip, in other words, a GOOD torrent, which are becoming increasingly rare these days -_-
On a side note, heroes season 2 is finished now, they're just going straight to season 3 when they get back. Sad, but strikes happen. :("
,Lord E,2008-01-02T22:05Z,"@ Suhfeli - Some facts to back that statement up, please? Clearly VLC is a media player with very broad compatibility, at least it supposedly works with all ""corrupted"" files in this torrent while some other media player (Windows Media Player?) doesn't."
,chaddd,2008-01-04T18:49Z,"What about the quality, is this HDTV?"

Thanks"
,joshp123,2008-06-03T21:58Z,"Nice, upload, thanks. 

And if you don't particulary like VLC and INSIST on using WMP, then you will need codecs- search for Cole2k in google- it's a big codec pack which has worked great for me, got MKV, ac3, divx and so on in

you should try it if you don't like VLC."
,Usay,2008-06-22T05:04Z,"Thanks DannOrly and all the seeders! If it is worth d/ling, it's worth u/ling! :) 
Just because its free doesn't mean you all can't contribute"
