I'm on 75.3% currently. If someone can seed this until I have 100%, I don't mind continuing to seed it until the others have it too but we're going nowhere fast at the moment. :( Cheers, Nick."
,NickManch,2010-09-28T21:04Z,"Well thank you to whoever was seeding - as we now have 1 seeder and the 3 leechers seem to have finished their downloads, unless they packed up early and gave it up as a bad job, which I very much doubt. Still 1 seeder showing but off-line. PLEASE if anyone else has this, PLEASE seed it until I have it - I am on 85.8% so I have increased since I posted yesterday but I can't leave my PC on during the day, which is probably when the others finished. Thank you and if the seeder comes back online later, hopefully I can finish and then be quiet. :)"
