Hey everyone,

I just wanted to point out that this is an indie game developed by two (THAT'S RIGHT, ONLY TWO) people. They created this game independantly and it is really a work of art. If you download this game and enjoy it and appreciate the years of hardwork that were put into it I urge you to consider buying it and supporting indie game developers:

It's different when a big corporate game developer like EA makes a game and makes millions, but these guys literally put two years of their lives into this game and like I said, anyone can see that it's an original piece of interactive art.

SUPPORT YOUR INDIE GAME DEVELOPERS! :)"

,grnthmb642004,2007-12-13T14:41Z,"i don't claim any points or credit for this crack...
i only searched and searched until i found it...

(i hate the arrogance that someone would post a torrent that you can't play unless you have the game key or password...that's just not cool on P2P... a big fuck you to CIY !!! )


i posted it as a torrent because web links can be killed.... now fuck off Kj7 !!!

by the way...i use win XP SP2 and it works fine in full screen..."
,Kj7,2007-12-13T20:37Z,"well why if the torrent is ok do you put the link : 

http://www.badongo.com/file/5562283

in if not to get some out of it ??

that link is 1 big fake , so i don't see why it must be there in the first place"
,kiri87,2007-12-13T20:41Z,"Truly an admirable work of art. This is the first time I regret using cracks for a game. I'll buy it as soon as I can, but 30 is still a bit too much for me."
,Kj7,2007-12-14T01:21Z,"mistal p... go die your self

well klik the fucking link and see if you can get anything out of that you fucking pri..

,SUBBoy,2007-12-14T19:13Z,"Jesus fucking christ, guys. Chill.
Does it matter if he would get some sort of points out of that link? If it's the working file then why the fuck does it matter?

It's no big deal.

PS: Thanks, grnthmb642004!"
,RockyMM,2007-12-16T00:59Z,"In any case, if you're able to buy the game, buy it, 30$ is NOT that much. 

OK, here's a test, if you finish the game and feel that you should somehow repay the authors, remmember that there were only TWO of 'em who have worked on this great game."
,midjunkie,2007-12-30T02:29Z,"FYI, badongo link points to the right file too, so fuck Kj7 and thanks grnthmb642004!"
,Kj7,2008-02-06T03:22Z,"well midjunkie fuck you self asswiper
Have you even tried to get the file from the site !!!The link does point to the file yes..and a site where you have to write some letters to get it , and what happens....NADA
you get to another site where you can write letters again tho the member number is still in the adress fielt so you can klik and write and klik and write the only thing you get is NADA but the fuckhead who point to the site gets points , i can't see why he in the first place puts in the link in the nfo if the torrent works...but what do i care anymore support the dickhead i won't."
