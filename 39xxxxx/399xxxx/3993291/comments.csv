I tried it with 1.13 and it did some funny shit with in game movie clips which caused it not to work at all shortly after starting play. Funny enough after downloading this, making it work and enjoying it I decided to buy a PSP... which was totally unrelated... I guess that was my appreciation of Sony.

See? Pirates download a hell of a lot of shit. But ultimately if they are inspired they buy the platform or media."
