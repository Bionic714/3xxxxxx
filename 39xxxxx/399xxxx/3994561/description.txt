Here are two pretty fun games, Test Drive Off-Road 2 and Monster Truck Rumble. Test Drive Off-Road 2 is a rip because with the iso there was no sound :? . Monster Truck Rumble is a full iso, and works perfect. Both of these games combined have been compressed to 75MB using KGB Archiver, which can be found [url=http://kgbarchiver.net/]here[/url].
