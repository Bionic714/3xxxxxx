ArtyTorrent Music Production Pack 24-Oneshots-Hi-hat WAV samples 1
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my third pack of drum and percussion oneshots. (Kicks and snares already posted). More percussion hits to follow.
Included here are around 900 hi-hat samples for use in dance music production, with a mix of open, closed and effected cymbals.

All samples are 44KHz normalized and trimmed WAVs for use with all major samplers and sequencers.
Programs for FL Studio's DirectWave sampler are additionally included for users of that app. UnRAR the dwp programs into a directory containing the multiple sample folders to load them up.

These samples are divided into the following categories:

Chicago Fire - Old Skool and Electro, Deep and Progressive House.
Ghetto Electro.
Loopmasters Disco and Disco House.
Vengeance Essential Club Sounds 1 - closed, open and special.
Vengeance Essential Club Sounds 2 - closed and open.
Vengeance Essential Electro - closed and open.
Vengeance Minimal House 1 - closed and open.
