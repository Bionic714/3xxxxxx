And great download speed, 90kB/sec :)"

,cptlongshanksrrrrrrrrrrrr,2009-07-23T06:58Z,"I just want to throw out a big thank you to narfos. I'm not downloading this as I got it about a year ago from TPB and this torrent *BARELY* survived as most people have never heard of the game.

It is one of the most amazing games as far as unique DC titles, go to gamefaqs.com for the walkthrough if you have trouble navigating the game.

Thanks again"
