,morris545,2008-01-28T10:56Z,i have to say this is the worst cam movie i have ever seen. Half the screen is missing and the picture is missing and what you can see is so blurry it hurts the eyes to watch. don't wast your time with this one
,homer.cayman,2008-01-30T04:09Z,"sorry sandman, I remember going to see the original in an empty theatre before anybody knew the meaning of ""they drew first blood"".  The vid on this one made me shut it off after 15 minutes.  Good audio, just can't watch it."
