,Suicide_Hz,2008-03-02T22:35Z,"I downloaded this iso and then mounted it, extracted to a folder then burned contents to a CD.  I cannot get it to boot.  I get a black screen with ""error loading operating system.""

It autoruns in WindowsXP but it will ask for a serial number and once it restarts the computer, it will hang up when trying to complete the install..

What am I doing wrong?"
,riho888,2008-03-03T09:28Z,"hy , guys i have a problem :/ . When i start burning this xp to cd , it says there isnt that much space on a cd ! 

What to I do ?"
,Suicide_Hz,2008-03-05T01:07Z,You need a CDRW not a CDR.
,straitline,2008-03-07T22:46Z,this is a great creation for i even got this one to network--alot of the other xp that ive installed had networking problems---thanks --this one is a keeper

,captinbirdseye,2008-04-02T11:21Z,do i need to give the cd a certain label?
,captinbirdseye,2008-04-02T11:22Z,"im just burning it as a bootable data disc using nero
is it that simple ?.."
,captinbirdseye,2008-04-03T01:19Z,Using a CDRW still wont fit ..?
,captinbirdseye,2008-04-03T01:20Z,"using nero,
should i try using my registered 'power iso' on another machine?"
,nino44,2008-05-29T22:34Z,Does anyone knows about any torrent of Windows XP + Sata drivers with windows xp games ?
,tai_chi_pirate,2008-06-16T06:07Z,"Integrated Key? Good!
WHAT ABOUT The 'ACTIVATION' Process?
IS WINDOWS GOING TO HOUND ME TO ACTIVATE?"
,yadayadaya,2008-07-01T16:00Z,"You need a DVD, not a CD or CD-RW.  An RW is still a CD 700MB or 650MB.  RW means it's just re-writtable."
,yadayadaya,2008-07-01T16:03Z,Oh I should also add WHAT sata driver are you supporting?  There are plenty of them.  J-Micron and Intel are both on my motherboard for example and you need different drivers to use one or the other.
,Maoxx,2008-07-24T16:27Z,Dear lord.. Ubuntu here I come.
,INhardCore,2009-05-30T10:40Z,"well, the ""vista style"" UI is nice & everything but why didn't you add icons as well
from your screenshots I see xp styled ""trash bin""
it would have been nice to change those  icons also so that you wouldn't have to hack  them yourself riscing to F*** up OS
but still think I'll down & check it out
& maybe if you have a icon pack for it you know that works, give me a word (raks007@hot.ee)"
