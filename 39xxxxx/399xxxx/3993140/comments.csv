,mahesh393,2008-09-01T15:57Z,"The Video quality is good (8/10). Since I do not understand German, could not comment on Audio Quality, but it sounds fine. Only downside is the subtitle file provided with this movie is not in English. It is in some alien language..at least alien for me."

You can get english subtitles from that link, but they are about 37 seconds fast, so you'll have to adjust them with a srt synch tool of some sort."
,TheInfiniteChange,2008-12-14T21:46Z,are the subtitles hardcoded?
