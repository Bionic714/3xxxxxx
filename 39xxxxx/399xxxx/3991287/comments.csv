,RevolutioN2012,2008-06-07T19:42Z,"And much cheaper!
Your welcome!"

Do you mean seeding?"
,snappy22,2009-02-26T22:04Z,Can someone please seed.
,snappy22,2009-02-26T22:09Z,"If someone seeds this torrent, once I've received it all I will seed for a year.

I purchased the James Stewart calculus book (which I find excellent material) years ago and am kind of pissed that my uni switched textbooks completely. I'm not in the mood to fork out $100 for yet another paperweight. "
