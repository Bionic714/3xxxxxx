,Astralia,2008-01-24T02:14Z,Who cares about if the year is right....give him/her som kudos for u/l it instead. Thanks for the up!
,lightface,2008-01-24T23:27Z,"Well, to write stupid ass to someone who has contributed, is really a dumb ass move itself.
But i agree that checkin up the original date when the movie has been released (www.imdb.com) then post your torrent and start seeding is a better way. Some people are just in to much of a hurry to do things right.
Im not sure people in general know that the year displayed next to the titel is NOT the year the film was uploaded, ItÂ´s suppose to be the year of its release, so dont forget that whoever might be reading.

Cheers!"
