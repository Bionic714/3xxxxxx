One thing I never understood: why do people make ""CBR""-files of the comics instead of the more wellknown SIT or ZIP?"

@klubbsoda .CBR is perfekt for reading with the comic book reader-CDisplay."

,SatanManofPeace,2008-01-27T16:51Z,".cbr and .cbz formats are meant to be used specifically with CDisply (windows) 

You're not suppose extract the images inside, as you would with zip or sit.
Other Operating systems use
- Comix (linux)
- FFView (mac)

Cbr and Cbz are compressed files, just like Zip, rar, or sit formats. But with CDisplay installed, as the name suggests, cbr and cbz formats can be displayed. In one cbr/cbz we can have as many images as needed. It's rather handy and the viewing isn't bad.

The alternative is .zip or .rar formatted comics.
If uploaders were to put it in this format, it would go something like this:

Main Folder - Marvel Knights Spiderman
Inside Main Folder - 22 subfolders (for each issue)
Each subfolder has around 20 image files

This entire thing would be zipped and/or rarred.
If I were to upload that, everyone would have to unzip/unrar first before they could view the images. Since the images are .png/.jpeg, people need an image viewer. Pain in the ass for everyone I say.

Comparing that to cbr/cbz format, cbr would go like:

Main Folder - Marvel Knights Spiderman
Inside Main Folder - 22 cbr files

If the person has CDisplay installed, they just need to click a cbr file and the viewing begins. Most uploaded files are in chronologically order, so say, you're on Marvel Knights #3. You just finished reading, and you want to go to #4. Just hit Shift+L and you go to it. If you want to go back Shift+K.
Also, a single cbr file is smaller than a folder (with images) because it stays compressed. With the zip/rar route, you have to unzip/rar it to view.

Some people like viewing it the multiple folders with 20 image each, and some like the cbr way. It's your choice in the end.
Hope this explanation helped.

Thanks for the extensive explanation!

I'm on a Mac, and I never heard of FFView before :)
So cbz/cbr wasn't really familiar with me, hehe. I always change them into sit's and open them so I can open them with Preview.

Thanks again though :)"
