ArtyTorrent Music Production Pack 22-Ueberschall Hardtechno vs Schranz WAVs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of Ueberschall\'s recent products have come in the form of VSTi ROMplers, with sample playback via their patented \"Loopeye\" and Elastik Audio timestretching. Personally, I find these VSTis a bit gimmicky. A flashy interface is all well and good, but music producers just want high quality samples they can use with any sequencer. Fortunately, the Hardtechno vs. Schranz VSTi allows hard disk rendering of individual samples. It took a long time for me to do this, but I\'ve RENDERED EVERy SINGLE SAMPLE FROM THE DVD. I\'ve not included the pointless construction kit mix demos, but all the constituent parts are here.
The DVD amounted to 1.5 Gig. My lean and mean 513MB RAR file includes 44KHz 16-bit files, all normalized and trimmed to loop correctly. Key and tempo info is included in filenames.

760 Loops at 135bpm
-------------------
Background, Bass Drums, Synth Bass, Claps, Crashes, Drums, Hi-hats, percussion, ride, SFX, Shakers, Snares, Synths, Vocals.

240 Oneshots
------------
Bass drums, Claps and snaps, crashes, hi-hats, percussion, rides, shakers, snares.

For producers of trance, techno, electro, and hard house, this sample pack is a godsend. Why worry about quality vs quantity when you can have both? ;)

Enjoy!
