,hn_rene,2008-01-27T13:55Z,@chantal. It is more likely that a third of your brain is missing.

,kornchild2002,2008-02-04T07:37Z,"Thanks for this.
I am now waiting for the 23453 people that post the movie trailer in the comments."
,freitax,2008-02-10T15:48Z,"to Chantal666:
no it's not, if you compare it to done, you can see this release actually shows more image."
,always_there,2008-02-14T07:02Z,"Even if it does show more image, its not the intended aspect ratio if it's anything other 2.35:1. If you understand cinematography, you would know why thats important. 
I'm sorry, but you do not watch an movie that's been nominated for Best Cinematography in anything other than the intended aspect ratio."
,freitax,2008-02-15T02:16Z,"I wasn't saying that the AR didn't matter, I was merely correcting the fact that the image it's not cropped, it's opened, so if you understand English language, you would know what I was talking about. And one more thing, many movies are shot with more than one aspect ratio in mind, I don't know if this is the case."
,Dustinthebastard,2008-02-16T15:25Z,"Thnx katapult! Great quality and great sound (although stereo) really enjoyed it!!
