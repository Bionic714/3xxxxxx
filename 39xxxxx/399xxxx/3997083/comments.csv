,Bunney,2008-01-31T19:19Z,"Omg, don't download this crap. The movie is delayed and the subtitles + movie don't match at ALL."
[T],dtrbot,2008-02-01T23:38Z,The Subs and the audio is perfectly fine there is a spoiler in here Mr Bunney 
,aliasdavidoff,2008-02-17T11:14Z,"It's MKV! I can't use that. You should have told us, dammit..."
,brohken,2008-03-05T23:00Z,"thanks!

works perfectly in VLC, english subs and all.

aliasdavidoff: get VLC (free) from videolan.org"
,FyreStarrter,2008-03-10T16:37Z,"OK am I missing something here. I am playing it in VLC just fine but I don't have any subtitles & don't see a subtitle file. THANKS for the upload by the way, I have been looking for this for a minute!!! "
,makoon222,2008-03-10T23:51Z,"mkv is a free format, and should be used more than microsoft proprietary avi crap. Thank you, uploader and ripper."
,fetish.alias,2008-03-16T08:17Z,"The the person having subtitle problems: check the Video > Subtitle Track menu. You should be able to select the track.

When I started it up, I wasn't getting subtitles either. The subtitle track was set to ""disabled"". Later, I shut down the movie and restarted it, and it was set to ""disabled"" again. I'm not sure why. But you'll probably have to do that every time you open the movie."
,fetish.alias,2008-03-16T09:47Z,"About the encoding: For some reason, it plays very choppily in VLC, and for some reason, I can no longer skip ahead in the movie without VLC crashing.

About .mkv as a format:

I'm not sure what about the format supposedly makes it better. I can make an AVI rip using Virtualdub (free) and XViD (free, open source) and Auto Gordian Knot (a collection of free, open source software and codecs). In what way is that ""proprietary Microsoft crap""?

Anyway, AVI is undeniably better. I get these stuttering and other random problems a lot with MKV-- with AVI, I only get them when someone (usually a newbie) encodes something really badly. "
,fetish.alias,2008-03-16T10:01Z,"Sorry to spam this thread with three posts in a row-- I should have saved them all up and posted them all at once.

I still can't skip ahead in the movie without VLC crashing (I'm trying to skip to the 50 minute mark, which is where I stopped watching earlier). VLC crashes every time. I don't know whether it has to do with the encoding, or VLC. Probably a combination of both.

I'm going to download an AVI torrent of this so I can finish watching it. I'd recommend you stay away from this one unless you like headaches."
,31415926,2008-03-28T09:30Z,"What is the language of the movie, guys? "
,Lozzie,2008-08-03T11:49Z,v good quality thanks dtrbot. I converted each separate file to its own dvd using convertxtodvd3 and all plays fine including subtitles.
,Jusext,2008-08-19T12:54Z,is this the uncensored version?
