Team Chicken Shirt originally released a commercial for ING Direct's super saver competition, but then they thought - why stop there? With the general response being "We love those characters", Team Chicken Shirt is now doing 1 minute - spin-off shorts. 

The first in the series is "Meetingus Maximus"!

Enjoy!
