Summary  


A new theme, potentially destined for Windows XP.
Freeware Royale Theme is a new theme, potentially destined for Windows XP, that has leaked out of Microsoft and onto the web.
The theme appears to have come out of a beta version of Media Center 2005 that was in testing.

The theme is not a substantially different incarnation of the existing of Luna, the current default theme for Windows XP.
You can see the main changes in the screenshots below; one could describe it as being a 'glass mod' of Luna.

As Microsoft knows, it is very hard to please everyone when it comes to themes.
However, I think they can be reasonably certain that most people will like this new version of Luna.

Microsoft New Zealand is making available some free desktop backgrounds for use on your computer.
Includes the New Zealand version of Bliss; the world-famous directional sign in Bluff; and the theme pack for Royale.
Check back each month as we add more!
