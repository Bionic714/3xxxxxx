Hello!


Alyson Avenue is the ex-band of Nightwish singer Anette Olzon. These great albums are  quite hard to come by, so grab them while they're hot, and please seed for a while after you finish downloading. :) And as always, if you really dig the music and are able to buy them from somewhere, please do it. However, I think all copies are sold out for now . The torrent includes the following albums:


Presence of Mind [2000] (320k)
Omega [2004] (192k)


Enjoy!
