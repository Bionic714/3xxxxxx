,andy4069,2008-01-27T03:30Z,seed please!
,LaserOne,2008-01-27T06:41Z,"I'll give it a 3/10..  The first 20 minutes something or somebody is blocking the camera and half the picture is blacked out..  Video is pretty rough, like a TV with bad reception.."
[T],despo1ler,2008-01-27T10:47Z,ty for a genuine release at last vicky73 :)
,Daworox,2008-01-27T16:11Z,Yes at last but I think it's still worth to wait a while for better quality (I mean 3/10 is REALLY ugly...)
,Armstrong14,2008-01-27T17:26Z,"Seriously, wait for a dvdscreener or r5 copy, or see it in theatres...  This movie rules if you have a good watchable copy!"
,ukxenon,2008-01-28T02:34Z,DO NOT BOTHER THIS VERSION IS TERRIBLE AND THIS TORRENT NEEDS DELEATING
,richardgriffiths32,2008-01-29T13:09Z,is it the full movie or a trailer ?
,danishfire,2008-01-29T19:46Z,"this is the full movie... but the quality is sooo bad you will regret it if you download 1/10 for picture and 2/10 for sound and in the beginning as far as id watch it there is a block in the right side of the screen, maybe a jacket over the lens or something.wait for a decent cam or better.."
,panzerweb,2008-01-30T00:56Z,"Quality sucks...so bad it's not watchable, even if you reduce the size to gain a bit of resolution."
