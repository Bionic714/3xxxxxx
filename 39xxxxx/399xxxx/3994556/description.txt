Led Zeppelin Discography (LIVE albums included, mostly 320Kbps)
MP3 @ 192-320Kbps (Varies, but more higher qualities than lowers)

For the STUDIO albums (and for the live album 'The Song Remains The same') I used
this torrent.
For the rest of the LIVE albums, I used this torrent,

I organized them (yet the first torrent that I used to get the studio albums was
very well put together, props and thanks to h33t) and put album art on them, etc.
Perfect and ready to put on your iPod/etc with correct labeling.
