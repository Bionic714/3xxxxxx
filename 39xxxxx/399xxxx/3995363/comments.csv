,cordelencantado,2009-04-25T09:51Z,"Is this ""Teldec's Bach 2000"" ?
@Kuthumi  Strange how different the recordings are, this one with boy sopranos. 
If is Teldec's Bach, the recordings sound different because they are HIP (historic instruments performance), what means they try to performance it with orginal or old instruments. That's why is not women who makes soprano and alto parts but men."
