,Xolexius,2008-02-01T03:32Z,Just finished disc 1/4...and gotta say...I LOVE THIS GAME..the music is amazing! keep it up Nobuo Uematsu!
,mondo,2008-02-15T20:57Z,Great game with a wonderful soundtrack! Nobuo UematsuÂ´s finest if you ask me.. Well FFVI is perhaps a bit better.. :)
,Primal80s,2008-03-20T19:31Z,"I just wish ""An Enemy Appears!"" was the default battle tune. I've only heard it a couple of times in the game but it's far livelier than the actual battle tune."

,Siggens,2008-04-17T19:32Z,"Great music! Best since FFVII if you ask me! (Never played FFIII(VI)) But, Nobou sure knows how to make good music! :)"
