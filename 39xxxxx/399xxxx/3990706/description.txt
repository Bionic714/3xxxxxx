Dude, Where's My Car? is a 2000 comedy film directed by Danny Leiner. Jesse and Chester (Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott) are two stoners who wake up from a night of wild partying to find out that their car is missing. This film tells the story of their journey to find the car.

The title of the film has become a benchmark of popular culture of the time of its release. It is referenced widely, an example being Dude, Where's My Country?, the title of a political book by Michael Moore criticising post-9/11 America.
