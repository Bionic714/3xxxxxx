Thanks so much!  I've been wanting to hear some other stuff besides what's on 'Take My Blanket'...;o)  I look forward to checking it out!

Any recommendations on any of his other albums?  I do like to buy when I can but I haven't heard any of them yet and I can't afford to buy them all!...LOL.

Cheers!
