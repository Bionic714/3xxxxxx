This one is exactly the same that provide ducky ( http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=177627 ) but muser_man (from plg) just add a chaptered authoring, without touch to the original MPEG2 files. So if you want direct access this one is for you !
Each song and each \"Scotch Mist\" interlude has its own chapters.
I\'ve included all the artworks found on dime\'s original torrent comments too.

This webcast is a definitely must have !
