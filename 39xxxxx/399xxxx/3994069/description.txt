This torrent is a collection of hard to find live albums of Rudimentary Peni, a must for die-hard fans who realize that we'll probably never get to see them live even though they've been putting out music since the early 80's (they  haven't toured since '82 or '83 but are releasing a new album early 2008).

Anyway, the torrent contains the following:
Catastrophe
	-a Bootleg of live material from 1982.
	Tracks 1-4 'Musicians Collective', Camden, London 7/6/82
	Tracks 5-24 Norwich Road Church Hall, Forest Gate, London 16/1/82
	Tracks 25-27 Norwich Road Church Hall soundcheck.

Misc. Live show
	-05.25.82

Black Side Live
	-unofficial 7창?? released some time back

Live @ Church Hall, Forest Gate UK
	-01.16.82

Death Church Demos
	-These are the vocal-less rough demos of tracks from Rudimentary Peni창??s 1983 Death Church LP, they창??re instrumental versions of the songs. They창??re rough, and not of final, studio-polished quality. 
This has never been officially released.

I'll share others as I come across them.  Enjoy!
