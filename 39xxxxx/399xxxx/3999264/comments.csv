,unr1,2008-01-27T21:01Z,"oh, and please seed :)
don't be a leech...at LEAST contribute 0.50 ratio"
,unr1,2008-01-28T08:08Z,"ok, well I finally saw this copy

subtitles aren't really that good (they are from here: http://www.opensubtitles.com/en/subtitles/3148191/khuda-ke-liye-en )
they could use improvement but do help a little.

about a little over 2/3 through the movie in large font ""pakimusic.com"" is displayed on the bottom.  This covers any subtitles but still allows the picture to be seen.

this copy is definitely watchable...although the non-urdu speakers will have trouble understanding. 
Good movie though."

,bahuna,2009-02-03T22:21Z,"The attached srt-subtitle file is of limited use because the text ends after about 2 hrs 20 mins into the movie. this means you'll have to watch and understand the last 30 mins without subs which is impossible for non-urdu speakers.
there are also no other subs anywhere in the net that match the frame rate of this version. 

so speak urdu or stay away from this one.    "

,PakistaniDragon,2010-01-26T20:30Z,"Aslamu-Alaikum,

I hope everyone is well.  The picture quality is ok while the sound quality is very good.

This is the cut version.  However, the deleted scenes have been added manually to make it the full version.  You can tell this as there's a big logo of PakMusic.net near the end of the movie (2:15:08 - 2:35:11) which ruins the whole movie.  An another scene of when Shan is explaining where Muslims have been and are suffering due to conflicts, this has also been removed (1:57:10).

A good effort.

Thank You
Pakistani Dragon
