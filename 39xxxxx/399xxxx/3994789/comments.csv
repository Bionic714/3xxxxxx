,goe234,2008-01-25T16:58Z,"man that's a great share. i'd recommend you all fans of bbc drama and comedy to visit this torrent site www.radioarchive.cc where you can share and download these treasures of old time radio. 
another good site is www.cheops.fm 

does anyone have david copperfield in a better quality??? it annoys me to listen to it with that quality. please spalli, if you have it in a better bitrate it would be so nice of you to re upload it here. 

many thanks"
