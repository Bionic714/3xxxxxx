I takes me about 30 minutes to convert regular movies to ipod with the help of Nero 7 Ultra and a fast computer.

I built this computer and over clock my 3.4 ghz Pentum 945 D processor to 4.25 ghz at 1000 Mhz bus speed with 1066 mhz bus ram at normal speed on the ram.  and my hard drives are 2 that are striping data as one drive so it twice as fast with a large air cooler to keep everything nice and cool.  keep this baby running 24 7    Cheers :)       I love the art of computer building"
