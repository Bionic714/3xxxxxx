Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I want MORE!!! That and I am dreading the word ""cancelled"" may rear its ugly-ass head and plunge my soul further into the darkness of a perpetually boring abyss. All this waiting is dildoes...."
,letallgetsmokedout,2008-03-24T07:26Z, Thanks fors ripping offs the best band in alls the fucking UNIVERSE!!!
,blemishednicely,2008-04-11T02:04Z,"Actuallyse, they'vse only rippsd off theze greatest solo artists of allz times...the band is only an add-on for the album/stageshow...for the TV show, all music/lyrics are performed by Brendan Small himself. The rest is more of an afterthought...I mean, who pays attention to the guy with a foot-pedal drum, cymbals and a harmonica (one-man-band)?"
,blemishednicely,2008-04-11T02:05Z,"It'll take some snappy dressing, at the least..."

,Lucky13s,2008-06-17T08:34Z,PS- That picture was drawn up by the creater of Metalocalypse before the show started so Pickles looks different in that picture. Everyone else looks the same.
,Fredrokk,2008-06-17T17:56Z,"Heys, does anyones knows wheres to fins subtitles for ze season twos episodes?"
,Thebrocksta,2008-06-25T10:50Z,"yea skwisgaar looks like alexi and toki reminds me alot in the way he looks and talks to that of Opeth fron man Mikael, "
,deadguy76,2008-09-08T14:34Z,"Actually Lucky, I think Skwisgaar is supposed to be Yngwie Malmsteen. Think about it: He's the ""fastest"" guitar player in the world and Skwisgaar Skwigelf sounds kinda like Yngwie Malmsteen."
