Wicked Beat Sound System is a Sydney based group whose sound is best described as a mixture of electronica, dub and soul. The group formed in 1992, following a series of live \"jams\" (a DJ production crew) performed at the now defunct Bently Bar in Sydneys Darlinghurst area and has released five albums to date. Originally featuring reggae and hip hop, the group expanded their sound to incorporate elements of soul, jazz, latin, funk and breaks. They have been nominated for three ARIA Music Awards and an Australian Dance Music Award.
