,notrobg,2008-01-27T06:49Z,not cams all good quality. 
[T],splattergod,2008-01-29T00:52Z,"Hey pothead, nice up, man.
Hey gallo55,
All cams, huh?
Whatever, you fuckwad! Probably just another MPAA scrotum licker.
Hell, if the Rear Window is actually a cam, I would grab it just for nostalgia sake...
If you are stating that the movies themselves are crap, then it's obvious that all your taste is in your arse.
Rare Window, A Fish Called Wanda, No Country for Old Men, etc, crap? I think not.
Of course, as you have never uploaded a single damn thing, it's obvious that you are simply some pinhead that got the wrong kind of loving from daddy, so you feel the need to troll boards.
Bet you troll elementary schools looking for dates, too."
,Spicey571,2011-01-12T21:11Z,From one Pot Head to another...Thanks for a good collection of movies I didn't have! I will seed once complete.
