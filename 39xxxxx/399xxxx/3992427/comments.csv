,Appleford,2009-10-07T13:45Z,"Full disclosure: this is the 65 minute edited version, not Tod Browning's original cut."
,redmetoc,2010-10-26T20:31Z,"John Nolte of BigHollywood.com rated this as #7 in his 2010 Top 25 Greatest Halloween Films so I thought I'd give it a look.

Getting a pretty good dl for my DSL connection of about 200 kB/s.  uTorrent shows S/P of 60/69 and I'm seeing 41/3 active.  Will seed to at least a ratio of 1.0.

Thanks for the up."
,dielaughing,2010-11-24T15:45Z,how can one not fail to warm to a film in which someone is turned into a giant chicken-woman.. Browning's film bombed at the box office and MGM plucked it from the movie theaters within a month of it's release.
