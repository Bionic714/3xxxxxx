,manster11,2008-01-26T23:10Z,"does anyone know the name of the last x-files movie,its the one where the smokeing man gets blown up in the cave and they find out the date the aliens invade the earth"

,Flokker,2008-02-05T03:00Z,"That's actually the last episode of the TV series he's asking about. Those events took place during Season 9, Episode 19, 'The Truth.' 

Awesome torrent, trying to clear some room for it. ;_;"

,saleksanders,2008-04-05T23:33Z,Can someone seed this please! 
,3261dan,2008-05-12T16:40Z,"@ furtherdown. My what a pleasant person you seem to be......

 Cheers for this Foux.
Can anyone comment on the quality?"
,Internet-Thief,2008-05-20T01:51Z,"I'll comment on the quality as soon as this finishes.

Fingers crossed."
,Lindberg_82,2008-05-22T22:25Z,The quality is good... 
,Internet-Thief,2008-05-26T02:50Z,"Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 624x464 23.98fps [Video]
Audio: AAC 48000Hz stereo 1536Kbps [Audio]

Good quality. Fanastic for the psp. I recommend overideing the aspect ratio in vlc media player or media player classic if you don't like it.

,Kurto2021,2008-05-26T23:54Z,I wish people would quit dropping off once they get this damn thing.  I am going on 5 days downloading it and I am only about half way.....
,sh07vp1985,2008-07-07T00:36Z,"Wow thats awsome finally i find all episodes=) Huge thanks man!

almost done DL:ing promise to put this on my 10 mbps upload server/seedbox for couple of months!

cheers!"
,3261dan,2008-07-15T15:27Z,"""I wish people would quit dropping off once they get this damn thing......""

Me too, I've been seeding this for about a month now, and the number of seeders has only dropped since I started, even though about 500 people have downloaded the whole thing.
 P.S.  I recommend CoreAVC codecs for these files, they have a very good De-blocking effect that seems to work better on these episodes than any other Deblock I have seen.
 CoreAVC is on the Piratebay, just get the one with most seeders."
,3261dan,2008-07-23T17:07Z,Does anybody know what the music is that plays during and at the end of episode 813-Per Manum?
,Aroone,2008-07-23T18:25Z,With this slow DL speed i'm gonna be done in a month or two :/ 
,chieftwit,2008-07-26T08:30Z,"Let's get some seeds, dammit. I'm seeding what little I have (less than 2%) on gigabit fiber but it looks like everyone else is on dialup... Come on guys!"
,dekuboy,2008-08-09T18:54Z,"This will take a while, but it's worth it :)"

Guys, this torrent is crawling with anti-p2p (mediadefender)

See this screen shot at Image Shack - http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/3175/36885027sr4.jpg - there were another 2 hundred pages of the same requests

Come on Media Defender - can't you come up with something better? This torrent has been going for 193 days and no one has been writing comments like ""OMG THIS IS GREAT AND AWESOME AND WONDERFUL"" with lots of smiley faces until I pointed out the torrent is salted by you. Do you really think we're gonna be fooled by you posting comments to encourage people to carry on downloading, even though you're tracking this torrent

Guys, the torrent might be ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" but it's also STILL crawling with anti p2p IP addresses. If you're going to download this torrent make sure you use Peer Guardian 2 and enable the p2p list in it and make sure you update that list often. That will block known media defender IP addresses. It won't block the new IP addresses they buy though.

what do you guys think - it explaines the lack of speed

i havent started downloading this just in case"
,The_Emperor_DJL,2008-09-05T02:02Z,"This will keep me warm and cosy as I save up for the dvd box set.. In Denmark that shit is expensive... 

Oh my.. X files is just epic!!!!! Some episodes suck, mainly some of thoose where its all about conspiracy and ufos.. I grow weary of Scullys constant ""but Mulder!"" remark.. Watch Eddie Izzard - Dressed To Kill for the best comedic perfomance on X files ever... 

Such a shame that I want to believe just sort of sucks so bad.. Story is great and all but its just too much.. GOOOOOOD MAN GOOOOD.. Like the script people all became religious.. For once this is a time where I cried to the heavens for scientology... At least then there would have been aliens involved... Fight The Future still reigns! And the spin off ! Lone gunmen.. heeeell yeah..

Cheers.. X - files are ace, except the episodes with Dogget.. Goood I hated them.. "
,Lord-Darkstorn,2010-04-12T05:45Z,"Okay, so the quality is okay except for Season 3?"
,he6rt6gr6m,2010-06-24T23:27Z,"The seeding is a laugh on this, if I'm honest. I've been downloading for a couple of weeks now, and have only got to 57%.

I'll stick at it, and will seed through the nights once it is complete."
,he6rt6gr6m,2010-07-02T14:36Z,"Now at 79%. Slowly getting there. Would appreciate some more seeds, then I can seed this fully."
,ili2882,2011-03-20T23:38Z,"Excellent quality
Seasons 1-5 are 4:3 624x464 FS Rips with an average bit rate ~650 kbps (VBR)
Seasons 6-9 are 16:9 WS 720:400 Rips with a bitrate of 650, audio for all is 96 kbps AAC LC VBR.
The video profile for Seasons 1-5 is Baseline@L3.0 and 6-9 it's Main@L3.1 meaning it's more/better compressed, if you play them on a portable device check to see if it supports higher profiles. 
ps. Season 3 is an excellent Rip, imo season 1 has the worst quality but that's not the rippers fault but a problem with the original media from 91."
,arthoheen,2011-07-13T20:27Z,seed please :-(
