,zomgkittylazerz,2008-01-26T04:43Z,"Summarized Experiences From Within the Cult Scientology:

1. Not allowed to see my mom but once a day when I was six. Was only permitted to see her at dinner for one hour.

2. My mom was made to work 12 hour days and was only paid $50.00 a week and given room and board.

3. I was made to live in a dorm at the age of six, separate from my mom or dad, with three other girls my age.

4. I was made to believe from a very early age that Scientologist were the better than other people, and if you were not in it, you were not good enough.

5. I was told to only tell my grandparents good things about myself when I visited, to not let on if I was behind in school, but just make them think I am a great student.

6. Scientologists constantly refers to people outside of their 'religion"" as ""Wogs"". A derogatory term used commonly by members in it.

7. I was made to join staff when I was 14. I had to sign a billion year contract because of their beliefs in reincarnation.

8. I had to stop attending school when I was 14, to join staff. I could only attend school one day a week on Sunday for about 10 hours.

9. I was made to live in a two room apartment with seven other women when I was 14. Overcrowding is commonplace. I live like that for most of my seven years on staff.

10. I had 30 minute lunches, breakfasts and dinners. If I was late back to work I would get in trouble.

11. I was working 10 hour days, six days a week, from the age of 16. I was not getting paid overtime. I was only making $50.00 a week.

12. The only time I would have off, was every other week, if my production was good enough. Sometimes I would go a month without even one day off.

13. When I joined, I would not see my mom for days at a time. She lived in a different dorm than I did, and had a different eating schedule than me.

14. At the age of 15 I was made to stay up until 12 pm every Thursday and Friday to attend Scientology meetings and clean their facilities with all the other staff.

15. After Scientology events we were all assigned a number of books or tapes we were suppose to sell to the public. We had to make our quotas before we were allowed to go home. I started selling books when I was 15. Sometimes we had to call from lists we were given to make our quotas. Most of these lists were to Scientologist who were out of the state or out of the country.

16. The staff was not aloud to eat the nice food put out for public after events. It was only for the public, we would get in trouble if we were caught eating it.

17. The staff was not allowed to socialize with the public after events, only to sell books, we could not join them on the dance floor, or in the auditorium.

18. The Hacienda (apartment complex where the staff live) is set up so that staff can not just get up and leave when they want to. The Premises is surrounded by a large gate and bushes so that people cannot see in easily. There are several cameras around the complex to keep an eye on the staff. There is a security guard at the front gate at all times to let people in and out. Staff may not leave without first explaining where they are going and what they are doing to the security guard.

19. Sea Org staff are not allowed to own televisions, mine was confiscated when I was 14 or 15. Staff are not aloud to watch TV ever. Movies are only allowed on the weekend if you get approval to have time off. Movies are not allowed on weekdays.

20. Most staff do not have cars or cell phones because it costs to much money to own them. If you have a car, you have to check with the security guard if you want to leave, if he is suspicious he will not let you leave.

21. The only days staff are allowed to celebrate and dance together is the Christmas party and Beer and Cheese party. Twice a year. Don't ask, neither of these celebrations make much sense.

22. I was forced to cut all ties with my dad when I was 15. He was declared a Suppressive Person by Scientology, and that meant I could no longer talk or associate myself with him at all.

23. My mom died of cancer when I was 16. She was still on staff "

Its time for Revolution."

,Schizoman,2008-12-03T07:02Z,"That huge long story seems way too extreme to be real.  There are laws against that sort of corruption.  I am in no way a believer or supporter of what Scientology is or does, but I have enough sense to not believe something that extreme.

Sorry."
,yxantos,2011-02-12T22:39Z,"Interesting story. And possible. It wouldn't be the first religious group to treat their people as slaves. Is irrelevant if there is a law or not against it.

If the situation is true, it would be extremely difficult to prove to the authorities since  the witnesses are brain washed and will not come to verify your story. In fact, they will come to refute your story.

If you add the tendency of the law to side with whoever has the deepest pocket. You will find that this is one case that the only way to seek justice is to make the public opinion believe the story is true. Thereof forcing the authorities to investigate."
