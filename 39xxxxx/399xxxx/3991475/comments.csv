Thanx!!!"
,[clm]berserker,2008-06-25T14:24Z,seed plz
,nonantroll,2008-06-28T00:23Z,"Thanks, Hayros, but there's no seed at the moment.

Can you help out?"
,hayros,2008-07-15T01:20Z,"Why, am I not seeding this? I will leave it on forced seed as it should have forever been then.
I did see some interesting comments about this setup on the giberlins three forum though so there is a possibility that this gets updated some time in the unforseeable future. I'll comment and post the link as a comment if such a thing happens"
,TheKle,2009-07-07T20:33Z,Seed please!
,littleslugger,2010-08-07T16:25Z,"hayros, please  seed. It'll take like 2 hours to collect all these mods myself. And you've already done it."
