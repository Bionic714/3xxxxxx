,yoshmojoe,2009-07-29T05:02Z,"Thanks but no thanks - upper and future uppers: please describe the contents of your torrents and provide an up-front preview if possible.

Contents of this torrent: images of imaginary rabbit/cat/mule/humanoid/WTF? type creatures (not my thing but honestly not 1/2 bad artist(s)) having ""sex"".  Wow, un-attractive imaginary creatures engaged in poorly depicted sex?  Yeah, right...  See a therapist, please.

Artist has a long way to grow when it comes to certain aspects.  Overall evaluation is that if you're into this kind of thing and are over the age of 10, you might want to consider seeing a therapist before you evolve into something that modern-day society will shun you for.

You can easily get a much better fix while maintaining your position in the social classes by going to a petting zoo and watching the rabbits f'ck,"
