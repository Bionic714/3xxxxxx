Vol. 1, Issue 1

With the help of the beautiful Sasha Madurta and a great cameraman who wishes to remain anonymous, FYM #1 is officially published!

It's been a long time coming and is the first in a long line of themed shoots we have cued up. 

If you'd like to help, either contact me via msn or yahoo, or via the SecondLife Group "Fur Yiff Magazine". Do keep in mind that since it's a free magazine, you'll be volunteering your time and efforts :p
