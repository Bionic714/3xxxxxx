Plot Line:
Three female college students take a detour from their 
partying, enticed by a beautiful European woman who 
promises seclusion, safety and maybe even romance. 
What they get is a living hell where they are sold 
to the highest bidder who's fondest wish is to kill 
them slowly. Hostel 2 also follows 2 American men who, 
on the flip side of the coin, are willing to pay to join 
an exclusive club where a life will end at their hands...
any way they like. It's a story of human monsters and the 
almighty dollar as only Eli Roth could tell it.
