,bitbomb,2008-05-29T00:49Z,"There's so much lame anime out there. Rare are gems like Akira, Ghost In The Shell, the Miyazaki collection (The Cat Returns, Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, etc....) and the like. This belongs on any list those movies are on. Absolutely brilliant. I was mystified, when it was over I just hit play again. This is me seeding."

,OnlyFoolsDNLDCAMS,2008-09-01T16:28Z,"BTW: This has embedded Swedish subtitles and its English dubbed, so for all you perfectionists out there who don't speak Swedish and don't want annoying subs - perhaps find another copy without hard-coded Swede subs.

Other than that, this film is one of the best anime out there."
,xXDion,2008-09-25T19:21Z,plz seed
,Ganesh420,2009-01-21T20:24Z,"Super freakin' fast D/L...THANK YOU SEEDERS!  Will continue to seed myself for a month or so.  BTW, now that I've got a nice big HDTV, could we possibly get this in a higher resolution?  It kills me so badly to stretch these small files to fit the TV that I have to watch these on the pc moniter."
,S!R3,2009-03-01T10:09Z,1mh4rd you forgot higurashi no naku koro ni .)
,ezboard,2009-05-31T08:14Z,"fucking built in subs, I hate shit like that, why can't you just include a .sub file?

thanks anyway"
,THX_1138,2009-06-30T21:06Z,"Maybe the seeders could be a little more generous with their upload speed. I'm looking at my bittorrent cliet and all the seeders I'm connected to (9) at the moment are at 100% and everyone of them is u/l under 1kb\s. That is like 0.2, 0.6, 0.5kb\s....etc. Come on people! Don't be so tight!!"
,King.Ironix,2010-06-15T21:03Z,"Anyone looking for a good quality copy of Paprika (english version, no embedded subtitles) I found it at btjunkie (type in paprika 2006 english) I cant include the link for some reason

It took about an hour to download because seeders were low at the time, but it was still worth it."
