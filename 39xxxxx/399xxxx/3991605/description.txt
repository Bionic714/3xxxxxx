                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the extraordinary story of a family reunion. In this case, the family 
is made up of one man and a few bears, living in isolation in the wilderness 
of Russia.

Edge of Eden: Living with the Grizzlies (formerly The Bear Man of Kamchatka) 
tracks Canadian bear expert Charlie Russell as he rescues two orphaned cubs 
destined for death in a squalid Russian zoo. He secrets them away to his home 
in the remote wilds of the South Kamchatka peninsula, in the former Soviet 
Union.

Two little cubs that know nothing about how to be a bear. Charlie becomes 
their surrogate mother and shows them the lay of the land in their new home 
territory, what plants to eat, how to catch fish and how to escape from 
predatory male bears.

Charlie loves the bears and then lets them go. But bears are like humans Ã» 
they need their mothers. In this breathtaking hour, trouble arises when two 
strange bears come back to Charlie's cabin. They're two of the cubs Charlie 
thought had died Ã» but they've returned to the only home and the only mother 
they know.

In a world where Ã´might makes rightÃ¶ and aggression becomes the only way to 
deal with conflicts, Charlie Russell is proving that it is possible to live 
peacefully with one of the world's most feared and misunderstood creatures.
