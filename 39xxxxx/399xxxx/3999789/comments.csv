Much appreciated."
[V],joshua13,2008-01-28T07:32Z,Did you used to do this on Demonoid? regardless I'd like to invite you to consider cross posting these at h33t.com. We've got some of the old demonoid comics crew and a lot of others. It's become a really good comics torrent site. hope to see you there.
