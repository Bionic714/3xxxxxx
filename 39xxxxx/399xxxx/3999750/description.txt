Alright, so me and my friend screwed around over the summer (I play trombone and work in digital music, and he plays piano) making music and having fun doing so. 
He is an amazing piano player, and makes even the most ordinary and tepid songs exciting and breathtaking. 
It is \"alternative\" to say the least and will make you laugh if you let it. i.e., The title tracks lyrics are:

\"Goddamn, I\'ve got a spoon in my ass, spoon spoon in my ass, spoon spoon in my ass; goddamn, I\'ve got a fork in there too, fork fork in there too, fork fork in there too; goddamn, I\'ve got a knife in the front, knife knife in the front, knife knife in the front, Silverware everywhere, cutlery.\"

My friend also plays \"Pure Imagination\" from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

If you\'ve ever jammed and recorded it, then download this torrent. 

It\'s big as fuck because it\'s in .wav and .aif formats, so you can delete it from your hard drive when you get done with it.
