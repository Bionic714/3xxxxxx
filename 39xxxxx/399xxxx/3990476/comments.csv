,drax12,2008-02-03T12:35Z,Has any one been able to modulate the master filter from the perform section? Unless I can do that I'm sticking with v3.
,drax12,2008-02-03T14:24Z,It seems I can modulate the master filter in the factory presets so I edited one and am using it as a template for new sounds.  If I start a new one from scratch; it doesn't work. Thanks for the d/l.
,Nobodyownsmusic,2008-02-23T00:00Z,"I downloaded this a couple of days ago, it seems to work ok, as a standalone, but when i try to use it with cubase, it says loading absynth fx folder, freezes and crashes cubase !!!!! does anybody have any ideas?     Thanks"

,smackedme,2008-07-09T08:48Z,"Lots of nice presets plus a few effects. This is a good synth. Nice drums and arps too.

Only problem I've had, it some presets take forever to load. You just have to go through and pick your favs"
,CamTron118,2008-09-19T22:31Z,"every time i start absynth my computer plays no sound whatsoever, even if i close it, i have to restrt my comp for sound to work. any ideas on how to fix this?"
,ymmito,2008-12-14T06:21Z,"HELLO EVERYONE. NOW LISTEN UP!!!! ABSYNTH 4 IS BUILT WITH AN ANTI-PIRACY MECHANISM. THIS IS THE EFFECT - THIS (OR ANY OTHER CRACKED) COPY WILL WORK FINE FOR AROUND A MONTH AND FROM THEN ON WILL CRASH WHEN YOU TRY TO SELECT ANY TAB OTHER THAN THE PERFORMANCE SCREEN (WHICH IT OPENS ON). IT CLOSES IMMEDIATELEY AND ALSO CLOSES SOFTWARE YOUR ARE USING TO RUN IT (VST MODE), ABLETON, LOGIC, WHATEVER YOU USE.
DOESN'T DO ANY DAMAGE, IT JUST DOESN'T WORK
IT'S TRUE, LOOK IT UP"
,rahsoft,2009-10-28T13:01Z,sounds like it in demo mode and not cracked.
,Atara-datenshi,2009-12-21T17:06Z,"i agree with rahsoft. had this vst (cracked) for some time around a year, and had absolutely no trouble whatsoever."
,lechache,2010-04-21T06:26Z,Very good torrent...works awesome!...Congratulations...Thanks...8)
,tuga_zappa,2011-05-09T12:38Z,"Hi seeders and leachers

I've found a way to overcome the ""startup crash situation"" (aka ""anti-piracy system"") that happens to NI's FM8, Absynth 4 and Massive.

Go to C:\Users\YOUR USERNAME\AppData\Local\Native Instruments\Massive (or Absynth 4 or FM8) and delete the file

1: NIAbsynth 4DataBase (for Absynth 4)
2: NIFM8DataBase (for FM8)
3: NIMassiveDataBase_ul (for Massive)

At the first startup, the application will say that it hasn't found a db file and that it will create another one...and problem solved ;-)
This works well in Windows 7, the snag is that you must do this every 30 days 'cos the ""anti-piracy system"" blocks the software after 30 days.
In Windows XP the NI anti-piracy crap does not work and you don't need this shit, 'cos in win 7 the above mentioned files are in a hidden read only folder that the uninstall procedure cannot delete, in XP this is not the case."
