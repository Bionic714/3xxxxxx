The story of a writer named Kwanpilin (Roongrawee Borijindakul) who just finished her latest book, a story about a evil lizard. One day, on the way back to Bangkok, she buys an old, small wood box from a local villager and that's when the mystery begins. Kwanpilin comes face to face with strange illusions and a supernatural curse with lizards, but no one believes her.

Kwanpilin soon realizes something is threatening her life and starts to discover a way to stop it without knowing that she may be the cause of this mysterious evil.
