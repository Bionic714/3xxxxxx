ArtyTorrent Music Production Pack 27-Oneshots-Cymbal Crashes-WAV samples 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my fifth pack of drum and percussion oneshots. (Kicks, snares, 

hi-hats and claps already posted). More percussion hits to follow.
Included here are 177 crash cymbal samples for use in dance music 

production.

All samples are 44KHz normalized and trimmed WAVs (many featuring stereo 

reverb) for use with all major samplers and sequencers. 
Programs for FL Studio's DirectWave sampler are additionally included for 

users of that app. UnRAR the dwp programs into a directory containing the 

multiple sample folders to load them up.

These crashes are from the following sample libraries:

Chicago Fire - Deep House, Old School and Electro.
Vengeance Essential Club Sounds 1.
Vengeance Essential Club Sounds 2.
Vengeance Essential Electro.
Vengeance Essential House 1.
Vengeance Minimal House 1.

Check thepiratebay.org for more music production packs in the future.
