,Polinalkrimizei,2008-01-29T18:16Z,"hey dakapho, el jeugo no funciona con PAL y wiikey y regrionfree. Sorry! Solo funciona con el nuevo d2c key y este solo funciona si tienes un nuevo wii con el d2c chipset. If anybody knows how to get it working on PAL wiikey please post it here! Until then: don't download this it is a pure waste of time!!!"

,yayap1,2009-02-06T06:34Z,"This works fine on my NTSC (that's the ones sold in the US) wii with a wiikey 1.9s. Make sure you are using high quality media, a decent burner, and are burning at 4x. I myself burnt this on a Memorex disc that was produced by Ritek. Thanks for the upload."

,ThatNYCGuy,2010-02-21T10:51Z,"Thats what you get for buying trash, kick the modchips, and start softmodding. Why waste the money. And invest in a fucking hard drive. I got a 500gb for $50 at walmart the other day. For that, your gonna save majorly by not having to buy DVDs all the time. And besides, games run and load much faster, even the framerates, ive notices are more stable when using a USB HDD vs DVDs. Besides, DVDs are a timex in a digital age. "
,RAR427,2011-09-06T20:52Z,This is English & NTSC format right?
