StepmaniaX v4.0 CVS (October 2007) - October 24th, 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a new build of Stepmania v4.0 CVS for the XBOX.

This October 2007 Build is a very stable release. 
It also comes with a ITG2 Theme which is really good.
The ITG2 Theme was Retro'd from ITG2PC and then converted to LUA
by vdl.

So start dancing and enjoy!

This is NOT the xbins/xport release and in no way affiliated with it.
IMO: This version is much better than that version as it was ported by someone whom actually works on stepmania, this version is able to play full-motion video backgrounds (.avi's, etc.), and is based off v4.0 and not v3.9, unlike the xport version.
