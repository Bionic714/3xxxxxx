,HankChinaski,2008-01-25T04:02Z,Where do I make these requests at because I see Godland on the list and I am missing nearly every issue before 18.  Any chance we could get a full run posted.

Listen ppl and listen carefully!
A crackdown on websites is taking place & if u do not wish your forum taken off the web then stop posting links everywhere!"
,XtylerdurdenX,2008-01-26T19:34Z,"Thank you so much for doing this.  for the life of me i cant track down Punisher War Journal #14 (Hunter / Hunted part 2).  the only comic store near me doesnt have it, somehow they went straight from 13 to 15, and i have 15, but im afraid to read it for continuity's sake.

anyway you could help me out maybe?"
