This 'episode' is from the 1996 Interactive Movie game "Star Trek: Borg".

It is presented in 'first person' like a FPS game, though it was a 'decision' game, where you watch the action and make decisions at key points.

You are Cadet Qaylan Furlong, who meets a certain entity who takes him back in time to the battle of Wolf 359, where his father died.

Furlong is given the chance to change history and save his father's life.


The video quality is a little low, but that is how the game was. Low resolution. It is perfectly watchable and enjoyable.
