Zeitgeist is the seventh studio album by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins. Zeitgeist was released on July 6, 2007 in certain countries and on July 10, 2007[1] in the United States and Canada. It is the first studio album The Smashing Pumpkins have released since their 2000 disbandment and 2005 reunion. Corgan indicated that, with Zeitgeist, he wanted to make a mainstream rock record, comment on the political climate of the United States, and explore the nature of the band and his friendship with Chamberlin.[2] The album was produced by Billy Corgan, Jimmy Chamberlin, Terry Date, and Roy Thomas Baker, and was recorded entirely by Corgan and Chamberlin.
