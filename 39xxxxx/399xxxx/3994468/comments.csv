[V],Kuthumi,2008-04-27T07:28Z,"For people who should be naturally suspicious with a .rar file: This film is real, no password or huh-huh, rather good picture quality, fullscreen stereo, synch is OK. 

I still see no point in making one .rar file,it saves no space and just takes time, trouble and disc space to unrar."
,Fallcore,2008-05-01T00:15Z,^^^ Agreed was my mistake. I release games primarily I was not thinking properly when I did this movie. But thanks for the comments about it working properly
