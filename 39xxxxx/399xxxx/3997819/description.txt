Note from the ripper: 
Hello everyone. I`ve noticed that a lot of good movies have slipped through the cracks of the ripping community. Some movies are no where to be found. If you are an avid movie collector, like myself, than you know exactly what I`m talking about. I am dedicated to bringing you all the good movies that you just can`t seem to find, so you can fill those unseemly holes in your collection.
When it comes to quality, I have one golden rule: If I wouldn`t put it in my own collection, than I wouldn`t post it.

Plot 

Jerry Welbach is given two ultimatums. His mob boss wants him to travel to Mexico to get a priceless antique pistol called "The Mexican" or he will suffer the consequences. The other ultimatum comes from his girlfriend Samantha, who wants him to end his association with the mob. Jerry figures that being alive, although in trouble with his girlfriend is the better alternative so he heads south of the border. Finding the pistol is easy but getting it home is a whole other matter. The pistol supposedly carries a curse - a curse Jerry is given every reason to believe, especially when Samantha is held hostage by the gay hit man Leroy to ensure the safe return of the pistol.
