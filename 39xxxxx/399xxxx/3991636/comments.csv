,specops_merc,2008-02-25T03:23Z,"Excellent movie.
Mike Hoare was technical adviser for The Wild Geese, the fictional story of a group of mercenary soldiers hired to rescue a deposed African president. Ironically, Colonel Alan Faulkner (played by Richard Burton) was patterned on Hoare himself. Also, at least one of the actors in the film had been an actual mercenary under Hoare's command."
