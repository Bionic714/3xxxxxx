,matrixjoga,2008-03-05T13:51Z,"Can anyone tell me how I burn the movie with the subs so that I can see it with the sub?

I burn the movie seperately in Nero 6, but I wan't to burn it with the sub...
// Johan"
,Guiik,2008-03-07T15:17Z,"Sure I can :P  you just down the sub file, check if it's synchronized, name it the same as the movie file and burn it as a datadisc.

ex:
movie.avi
movie SUB.srt

that's how I do it, you don't have to write ""SUB"", but it's eaysier for me to manage my files on my pc that way ..."
,dolphane,2008-03-13T03:05Z,can someone tell me why no matter what program i use converting to my appletv (mp4) it always comes out worse quality-wise? ive used several programs.

Question,
When I convert using WinAVI, and burn using DVD shrink. While watching on DVD player, the picture sometimes gets choppy/slow.

Is there a way to correct this???? It's a top of the line DVD player - it reads everything.....

Thanks,"

,FTW2000,2008-03-29T19:30Z,"""I don't give a flying fuck about if the story was good or not - HOW'S THE QUALITY??"" I dont get it. Its okey to watch paint dry only for 2 hours only the quality is god? On the other side did I ""watch"" 28 days later by 200 meg file courtesy by kazza. "
,Endotech,2008-03-30T06:41Z,"This goes to stunnerman:
Just by a standalone player.  I got a 5 disc for under $100.
Ripping a 9gig DVD to 700mb then trying to convert it back to a higher resolution....you are going to loose quality that way."
