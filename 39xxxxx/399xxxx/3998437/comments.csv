Just so everyone knows, this was the one played on Australia day 2008!!!

Nice work Cougs!!!!!!"
,CWC_Cougar,2008-01-28T04:46Z,"Thanks Headspin. 

Your comments are what keeps me posting. 

Enjoy!"
,marcus_ivo,2008-01-28T08:13Z,"Thanks for putting this together so fast Cougar! Nice choice of videos too, good addition!"
[T],maherie,2008-01-28T11:53Z,"dude quality upload, I myself love when I see Aussie torrents of music getting upped. Check my profile for australian dance torrents..."
,marcus_ivo,2008-01-29T12:45Z,"I'm a bit confused with your choice of Foo Fighters tracks here however.
Instead of The Pretender in at number 6 you've got a track that's really called Once And For All. Then down to number 82 where Long Road To Ruin should be, you have their track Statues.
Luckily I have Echoes Silence Patience & Grace so I can easily sub in the right tracks and I still massively appreciate the upload and hard work.

For anyone looking to complete the list with the Foo Fighters tracks you can find Echoes Silence Patience & Grace here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3818696/Foo_Fighters-Echoes_Silence_Patience__amp__Grace%5BFullCD_Video%5D%5B320kb"
,CWC_Cougar,2008-01-31T08:54Z,"You're correct marcus, my apologies.

I got those 2 tracks from my copy of Echoes Silence Patience & Grace, which I've just checked and the entire album is incorrectly labelled.

This sort of thing happens when I try and get it out quick, I will see what I can do about fixing it. I will likely post a fixed torrent soon."
,CWC_Cougar,2008-01-31T09:27Z,"I have submitted a fixed torrent. All files are identical except the 2 that were incorrect which have been replaced. I have not included the video files in the second torrent.

,Headspin20411,2008-01-31T09:34Z,"I work on the road and have played this comp thru twice already!  Great quality, and I already fixed the two foo tracks in my download so no worries.  If anyone is thinking of getting this, its worth it - cheers again cougar. :)"
,marcus_ivo,2008-01-31T12:51Z,"No worries mate, I know what you mean, I've been the victim of poorly labelled tracks too.
The fact that you got this torrent up THE DAY AFTER the countdown broadcast, you did awesome to make so few mistakes!
Cheers again!"

,cdtext,2009-03-07T09:14Z,"Thanks to CWC_Cougar for another great upload.  Are you going to plug the gap for 2005 and go back and do all the previous years?

I have got the ball rolling with my comment. I also would like to see him publish the entire list so we know exactly where our favourites ended up."
