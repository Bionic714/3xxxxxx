,IanPoondit,2008-01-25T04:58Z,thanks a lot appreciate it. thought you weren't coming back there for a second.
,Stokeman,2008-01-25T23:09Z,"Personally, I thought the show on the 11th with Steven Gibbs was totally ridiculous! Just the way he had an answer for everything. Not to mention, how he had some scientists contact him but her couldn't remember their names or on what website that they posted their findings and the b.s. about how he had sold his machines to at least a dozen doctors and how they got fired because the AMA found out they were using his machines. Just didn't fly with me! I personally feel the guy was not genuine. Who knows, I know I don't! Later All!  ENJOY the shows!"
,IanPoondit,2008-01-26T06:42Z,lol not as bad as the Jan 19th show with Glenn Kimball. This guy never has any sources or names to look up. Just one ridiculous claim after another.  most of the show was about islam and he sounded like a total hick and ignorant whenever he was trying to talk mohammed.
