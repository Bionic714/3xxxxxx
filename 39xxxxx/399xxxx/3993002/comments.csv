Yeh I just tried it myself, black screen.. But I'm not 100% sure that I hav emy regionfree option on.. Oh well I guess I'll just trust you."
,isepiq,2008-11-27T04:29Z,I got this version & another version.  Both of them lock up during the (play game) intro unless you hit the + (plus) button at that time.  Worked on a D29Pro modded Wii using the plus button.
