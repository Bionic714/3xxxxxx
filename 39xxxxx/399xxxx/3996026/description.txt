HARDtalk ? Noose Around Gaza (BBCNews24, 2008 01 22) avi

Israel is tightening the noose around the neck of Gaza, cutting off electricity and plunging much of the Strip into darkness.

The Israeli Prime Minister is adamant that the Palestinian territory will get the bare minimum as long as democratically, elected Hamas remains in charge.

Will a defiant people crack and give in to oppression by Israel and the West? Does such pressure just toughen resolve?

With Hamas still refusing to recognize Israel, it's yet another complication to President Bush's hopes of a Middle East Peace deal by January 2009.

Dr Azzam Tamimi is a Palestinian-born academic, a supporter of Hamas and the author of a book on the group.

Can he see a way forward out of the current gloom?
