,mr.kelboorn,2008-01-30T03:19Z,keep seeding it man this is like the only English gundam wing videos at all
,AmateurTattooArtist,2008-01-30T03:50Z,"I'll keep seeding, indefinitely.  These ARE the only english dubs out there, I've looked everywhere.   That's why I wanted to  share with you other gundam fans.   How  close are you all to being  done?"
,mr.kelboorn,2008-01-30T03:50Z,and one more thing YEAAAAH THANKS MAN 
,AmateurTattooArtist,2008-01-30T23:15Z,"alright... to repeat my question, how close are you guys to be done?  percentage wise that is."
,AmateurTattooArtist,2008-01-30T23:19Z,"never mind guys, i just foundon azureus how to see how far along you guys are."
,AmateurTattooArtist,2008-01-31T00:50Z,"Alright, new update, I have set everyone that is downloading to 1kbps except one person, this is to expediate getting more seeders.  Once I have one other person seeding with me I will remove the restrictions on everyone else.  Otherwise it's going to take a month for everyone to get this downloaded.  Hope this doesn't piss any of you off, just hold tight and have a little patience, I'm trying to do this as fast as possible.  This is the first time I've uploaded my own torrent so in the future I will use superseeding to side track this problem.  I'm learning as I go."
,AmateurTattooArtist,2008-02-01T13:29Z,"Alright, now I've got 10 of you over 90% so you should all be done today, let me know what  you think of the videos after you check them out.  "
,angeaoi,2008-02-13T15:51Z,"gahh, we really need more seeds on this one"
,honijn3,2008-02-13T20:22Z,Why can't I download these episodes? Can somebody tell me pls? 
,Xenocidebot,2008-02-15T17:42Z,"Awesome series, can't wait for it to download.
Hopefully seeding goes better for you soon man."
,zylpher2,2008-02-16T21:34Z,"Ho is quality, I am looking for possibly dvd rip or quallity, The only ones I have are recorded from CN and from Prowl."
,AmateurTattooArtist,2008-03-22T00:18Z,"alright, i've got 13 seeders yet but i still haven't heard if people are happy with it.  Let me know people"
,Gaara_Sandwarrior,2008-03-25T05:11Z,"Dude, i would really love if you could seed this some time, because currently ive been unlucky and stuck at 27.4% done. I leave it on all the time hoping that youll be seeding at somepoint so if you could do it mate that would be awsome."
,AmateurTattooArtist,2008-03-29T03:54Z,"I leave my pc on pretty much all day and I am always seeding it, right now i have 11 dl'ers connected with 53 total so i'm sure everyone is going slow i need some help from the other 2 dozen  or so that have already downloaded"
,AFrostyStranger,2008-03-31T06:07Z,Seeders Please been looking for this for a while now. Thanks in advance!
,elnutella,2008-04-03T07:41Z,"Could anyone upload Endless Waltz separately please? I'm gonna d/l this anyways, but I really just want the movie"
,elnutella,2008-04-03T07:47Z,nvm
,riotpirat,2008-04-09T20:28Z,"i love you all a little bit each!! thanks!!!

(by the way its not in a gay way)"
,bm5k,2008-04-14T05:08Z,so what's the quality of this?
,AmateurTattooArtist,2008-04-21T01:09Z,"I've been asking the same thing BM5K, I think it's good quality but I encoded it and uploaded it so I might be a little biased.  As far as i have seen it's the best GW torrent around.  But you know people on here are as bad as stupid bloggers always bitching about something, that's why i've been asking everyone what they think of it"
,darklynx489,2008-04-24T23:13Z,"You know, it's great, forwarding the right ports and seeding so that you help the P2P community is just the thing to get super-high speed downloads compared to everyone else.

I've remained at a constant of over 80Kbps the whole time and at over 100 Kbps for the last 6 hours (sometimes hitting over 200 Kbps).

So anyone complaining that there isn't enough speed....don't stop your upload!

I've also been the biggest uploading contributor the whole time, at over 150 Kbps!

Everyone else is doing maybe 20 Kbps tops! Average. There's 2 people over 20 Kbps but under 50.

So I don't want to hear whining about how I'm getting unreasonably high dl speeds, because you would get them too if you contributed more to P2P.

Also, I'm seeding 2 other torrents.

Also, I love this show, thank you so much Amateur and I will continue to seed this because it is something that needs seeding!
Just due to it's awesomeness."
,eizyarkenkor,2008-04-25T20:28Z,"thanx man!!! =)

,BobTheTomato,2008-09-17T17:59Z,"OK i am downloading this and i have 2 Seeds and 35 Peers, i am new to the Torrent thing but i am a fast learner. This is the best Gundam show ever in the world. Thank you for making it possible to upload, but we need some more seeders to help the rest of this go. As i understand it if you download it and keep it in your program it will seed to other's, this is what i intend to do when i get done with downloading it. Once again thanks for the awesome download!! i cant wait to get it!!!"

This download in particular started off with 100+ kb/s speed, but now it's at only 7kb/s after about 45 minutes or so of downloading.

,superawesomecooldude,2008-12-07T08:08Z,i dont think u converted right. the screen kinda shakes a lil if you look real closely at the screeen. i dunno why. good quality though.
,etindle62,2008-12-19T21:17Z,"mine is at about 87%, and episodes 1-4 are done, so I went ahead and watched them, and the audio is fine, but the video is very shaky, and pauses at random times, making the audio way off.  I tried playing it through windows media player and media player classic and it does the same thing every time, is anyone else having this problem, or do you know how to fix it?"
,DDenizen,2009-01-23T18:14Z,"I'm at 61.5 %, come on seed this. I will seed for months on my computer!"
,BloodshedRomance,2009-01-24T00:17Z,"PLEASE, ANYONE, SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,shamanit,2009-04-06T00:28Z,"Just got done downloading this torrent. the quality is not so good. when i went to watch the episodes they were all choppy and such, if i find a way to fix this i will post it on here. sound is good though and the movie works as well. its just the episodes of the series that are currently having issues."
,shamanit,2009-04-06T15:50Z,I retract my previous statement. it was not the episodes that were having trouble i did not have a codec turned on that was needed. if you find yourself having the same issues you can download the K-lite Codec pack. it will have everything you will need.
,Neusyn,2009-06-11T22:47Z,Awesome! The whole collection is here. I recommend Media Player Classic if you need a player and codecs. I'm going to seed till I'm at a 10 ratio.
,boogfart,2009-06-30T18:40Z,Dude... that's perfect; I can watch these on my PS3 now too!!! Thank you!

I opened the folder and the first 7 episodes are all the first episode's video file, along with 8-10 and 13-15 being exactly the same. I really want to watch this show. was it just a download error or is there some way I can fix it?"
,sadnapkin,2010-12-19T05:35Z,Ok maybe they all just start exactly the same...
,jeffzero,2011-03-18T03:32Z,"I don't comment much but I definitely felt the need to do so this time. Thank you so very much, AmateurTattooArtist, for converting the files so my PS3 will play them. A friend and I like to watch nostalgic things from our childhood on my TV through the PS3 and of course the console is fairly limited in what it can play. By doing the hard work for us, we're immensely grateful! I'll seed for a long, long time."
,Kongal,2011-03-26T18:29Z,"Hey i just finished Downloading this, but when i try to open it and watch it in windows media player it only plays the Sound and i cant figure out how to get it to show the Video as well. could someone please help me out? Please?"

To those who keep asking for seeds... DON'T be impatient pricks. Sit there, shut up, play a game or watch a movie, let the bitclient's do their job, it'll finished when it damn well finishes."
,molee,2011-05-07T19:53Z,"definitely a torrent worth downloading!  I must agree 100% that this is one of the best dubs out there and I am so glad you've made it available to us :D

Can I get some ink, AmateurTattooArtist?

Will seed until the end of time!"
,ereon6,2011-08-10T08:44Z,"Awesome torrent!  The one MAJOR disappointment though is that there's NO intros!!  I LOVE the opening theme, so to have it cut straight to the episode made me a bit sad :(  Overall though, top notch!

My cards are gettind old and somehow my ps3 media server doesnt work anymore and so is my Vuze ps3 encoder. I tried all kinds of settings.
