but i encode these the best i can sticking to scene standards (and not calling them dsr or hd when they are not :p ) and download any hdtv rips that come out for the show later.

the everything going digital in 2009 (which was suppose to happen in 2006) i think is mostly for over the air broadcasts. so those old ""rabbit ears"" hooked up to a sdtv  with 2 prongs wont work but there wont be any problem for anyone with digital sat/cable.
i heard you might even be fine if you just have basic cable from the wall to your tv.

that looks pretty good for regular analog setup. just be sure to crop and resize when encoding."

I recorded it last night, and right now in the process of converting it.

I'm hoping you got yours also, cause I missed a few seconds of the show cause I forgot I had the thing on pause and left the room."
,death734,2008-02-01T05:31Z,"well what happened is that i'm not at home right now (and didn't set up logmein correctly) so i dont have access to it (its recorded tho). i was hoping the hdtv rip would come out last night seeing as how fqm did mythbusters quickly.
i will be back friday night and maybe an hdtv rip will be out then (usually doesn't take any longer) but if not then i can upload my tvrip"
