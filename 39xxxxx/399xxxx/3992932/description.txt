Some assembly required S01E04 will come out thursday.
If a 350mb HDTV rip comes out later then go ahead and download that (i will) because it is better quality (this rip is good but hdtv rip is better). i\'m still uploading this incase there is no hdtv rip or if it just takes a little while to come out and you want to watch the show sooner...
