This is the latest release of the Joda rompack for the Nintendo DS, verified with NDScrc using the release-list on http://www.advanscene.com/, and repacked with 7-Zip for maximum compression. Se the current, previous, and future releases on  http://thepiratebay.org/user/magumagu/.

Get more info in the attached .txt-file.


This is the first out of four re-releases, of 500 roms each, to celebrate the upcoming 2000th release to the NDS scene. The next two packs will come at 24h interval to give me a head start with seeding each, and the fourth when we reach 2000.

The archives do starting with this pack, thanks to NDScrc, include the properly named rom as well as cover art, in-game art, icon, and the nfo for every release.

Donations are good for your karma!


Cheers, puss och kram!
