WHERE THE BUFFALO ROAM - 1980

  This film deals with the exaggerated life and times of Dr. Hunter S. 

Thompson the journalist at the beginning of his nationally recognized 

career, circa 1967-1973. The movie moves in chronological fashion, 

pulling stories and situations from 4 or 5 books he wrote which 

chronicled his travels and findings during that time period ("Fear and 

Loathing on the Campaign Trail" is one of those books). The movie was 

made at a time (1979) when few knew who this man was, so it was 

presented in a manner which would make the characters in the film 

easily accessible to movie-goers and fans alike.
  Bill Murray as Hunter S. Thompson does an absolutely fantastic job of 

capturing the writer's quirks, along with his style of speech. The film 

captures his abuse of alcohol, drugs, and firearms quite well. Peter 

Boyle as Lazlo (Thompson's attorney) is magnificent.
