"The Worlds of Joseph Smith" is a two-day academic event cosponsored by the Library of Congress and Brigham Young University. All sessions took place in the Coolidge Auditorium of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., on May 7, 2005. Recognizing Joseph Smith's bicentennial, the conference examines his historical, religious, social, and theological contributions. The sessions of the conference examine Joseph Smith in the world of his own time, his recovery of past worlds, his challenges to the theological world, and his making of a global religion.
