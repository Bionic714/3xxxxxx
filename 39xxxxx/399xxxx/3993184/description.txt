HITMAN chronicles the frame-up and retribution-packed odyssey of Number 47
(Timothy Olyphant), a bald assassin raised from birth to be a killer and 
tattooed with a barcode on the back of his head. There's lots of BOURNE SUPREMACY-style flash-edits and superhuman stunt work as 47 seeks to find 
out why moderate Russian presidential nominee Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen) was  
the client for his own assassination.
  
Cast: Timothy Olyphant, Ulrich Thomsen, Olga Kurylenko, Michael Offei.
