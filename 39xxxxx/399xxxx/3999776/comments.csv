Just make sure you move/copy the file SallySalon out of the crack folder into the folder that the game is installed into or it won't work when you go to run it."

Is this only 60 mins of the game?"
,Nitz5785,2008-07-21T23:10Z,"This is the full game. If you install the crack properly, you don't need a serial number. Read the read me .txt file"

,winthrop_angelluv,2010-05-19T12:42Z,Nitz5785 hi...I really do love this game but the problem is i keep on setting up the trial version. I've done it four times already. the files on the crack won't open. How do i do it. I might have missed something or what. What do I have to do?

,Lola1991,2012-05-06T02:42Z,"For me, it worked when I pasted the crack file in C:Program FilesSallys Salon , but I don't know if that works out for everyone. (It's basically what aprilshowerz said before.) Then click the copy of the crack file.

Anyway, thanks Nitz!"
