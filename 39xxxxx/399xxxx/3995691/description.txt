Book four,  The Mystery of The Spiteful Letters is the book that marks the transition between books similar in style to the 'Five's' and the 'Secret' series to books more in the style of the 'Barney' stories. Clearly, as the Mystery series progressed Enid was aiming it at older children than when she first began. This is very clear from The Mystery of The Spiteful Letters as it deals with more adult themes, such as blackmail. However, Mrs. Moon, the illiterate letter writer must certainly have been full of spite to so laboriously go through each letter of a children's alphabet book, learning how to write by copying the shapes of the letters in order to spread her accusations! And to read a dictionary just to find the right words, and then to underline them really is going a bit far! It is this one oversimplification that spoils the book, which otherwise is a very mysterious and involving read.
