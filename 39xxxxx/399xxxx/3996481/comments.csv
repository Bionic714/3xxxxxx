,JustRob,2009-08-06T16:51Z,The quality of this is utter crap... Don't bother downloading this the resolution is about as big as a Gameboy Advance screen. Waste of time

,SwuQ2G2i8,2009-12-07T21:41Z,Downloading anyway.. still like the post about the quality do..

,Lightmanone,2011-08-31T18:53Z,"The screen is 352 x 576.. Yes, only 1/3 of the view is used on the movie, it's very low quality. Unworthy of the download :("
