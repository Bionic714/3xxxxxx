Normally, I have a little blurb that says no need to comment.  But, this time I do want your comments.

So far, I've put up some mainland China music, language teaching stuff, and martial arts.  I haven't yet, but I can put up, western movies with chinese subtitles and/or chinese movies with or without english subtitles.

My question is...  What do you want me to put up?


PS...  Thank you to the uploader that put up the Day Glo Abortions torrent the other day.  That was cool."

Thank you so much."
