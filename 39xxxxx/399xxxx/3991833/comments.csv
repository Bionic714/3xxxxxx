,sasanka,2008-01-27T19:00Z,movie info is easy to find so it's useless to put it here. you'd better tell me if this file is a fake or not. so far allthe torents for this film were fake.

,scotskitten,2008-01-29T10:04Z,Why the f**k are you guys saying it a fake and that its just to get you to go to another site!!!?  Thats f**kin bulls**te!!! There is absolutly nothing wrong with this. I finished downloading it last night & checked it this morning the quality is 10/10 sound 10/10 cant say about the film as havn't watched it yet. So stop pissin about guys!!!!!!
,Darkday,2008-02-01T08:18Z,"This one looks fake....

When trying to play the movie in Winamp or WMP11 - message appears in video: Warning HD codec not detected! please get the correct codec from:
http://www.hdmi2.com

That is not a pop-up error message or anything but the actual video is just a black screen with this text at 20kbps video bandwidth....

This seems suspect. What seems more suspect is re-zipping the file compresses the 700MB to 1.5MB.

I call shenanigans.  And trojans. And maybe MPAA loading fakes...."
