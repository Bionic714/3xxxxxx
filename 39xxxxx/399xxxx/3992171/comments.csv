,LordSajo,2010-02-19T09:22Z,"I have seen a few celebrities, mostly movies stars, but the best one was on Christmas Eve having dinner with my family and I see the family get seated at the next table over.  I lean close to my mother and say ""Isn't that Anthony Bourdain?""  It turned out it was, and it was better than any of the movie stars I've seen in person."
