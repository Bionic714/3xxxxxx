Hello!

This is my first torrent. I created 20 ringtones out of some of my favorite songs and formatted them to work with the Apple iPhone.

I know they\'re kind of random, but these just happen to be 20 songs I like a lot!


If people seed I\'ll make more. Let me know any requests. Oh and I made sure to get the good parts of the songs, unlike dumbass itunes that gives you like verses and guitar solos!
