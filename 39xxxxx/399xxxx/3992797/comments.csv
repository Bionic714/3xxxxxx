,neocorpse,2008-02-16T05:40Z,"sorry man, but this is the same garbage crack as all the others, it won't even appear in the task manager to cancel so the crack will work. this isn't a keygen it's the same shit crack previously packaged."
,tonicenergy,2008-02-18T01:38Z,"IT WORKS! IT WORKS! Neocorpse... i don't know how it could not work for you. I'm ran the ""Keygen.exe"" on my laptop, then on my desktop, and both opened with no problem, and they are virus free. I'm running XP Pro SP2. Try reading the INFO.txt lol Anyways, THANK YOU Creus for making a working high quality crack. "
,depro,2008-02-29T21:18Z,works just fine. thanks to the uploader.
,kilr13,2008-03-05T14:18Z,"It works, I tried two other Objectdock torrents that were shit, but this one works! Just install, run the keygen, patch the Object dock exe, and save your license to the object dock install path."
,darkm12,2008-03-06T18:40Z,"Bullshit it works. I have WinXP and...

Error: ""keygen.exe is not a valid win32 application""

So how do others NOT get this error? Bunk!"
,MadHaTTer29,2008-04-04T17:16Z,"***VISTA USERS*** 

1. run the installer file (objectdockplus_190.exe)
2. open the keygen as administrator other wise you get an error.
3. click ""patch"" in the keygen and select ""ObjectDock.exe"" (this file is located in program files under Stardock directory unless you chose a different path)
4.save license in the same directory(program files > stardock > objectdock)


Good luck guys
I love this software !!! Thanks Creus    "
,Kriska1337,2008-04-12T15:51Z,"Works fine overhere, thnx for sharing"
,yunais,2008-04-20T01:15Z,THIS KEYGEN DOES WORK 
,Gibah,2008-05-16T15:14Z,"I'll confirm this working on Vista x64!
Installed using the instructions from MadHaTTer29 (same instructions as for XP but right-click Keygen.exe and ""Run as Administrator).
Works just great, thanks for the upload!"
,Kallileo,2008-05-31T22:46Z,"Hi. The keygen dosen't work for me. I've tried to activate it my other computer and still it didn't work.

Can anyone create a new hotmail-adress to activate the program, and then send me the password to the hotmail-account and the product serial number you used??
My e-mail: >

If it works i'll give you a Demonoid invite :)"

,botbry,2008-06-04T06:50Z,"we all should listen to MURPHY, the keygen is a trojan! big surprise there though. AVG caught it as soon as it finished dl and put it into quarantine. but it wont let me delete the rest of the files that came with it. just a warning!!!!!!!!"
,Kallileo,2008-06-04T22:28Z,Anyone know of a keygen that actually works??
,terrydandan,2008-07-09T01:14Z,Keygen doesn't work. You suck.. 
,sanchopanza666,2008-07-17T16:44Z,"This torrent is a shit. Doesn't work, and the ""keygen"" is a trojan.

DON'T USE THIS SHIT."
,SylentEcho,2008-07-27T17:48Z,"The Keygen is not a trojan you nub. Your AV just wants you to think that. Crack works fine for me. GOD, I hate n00bs."
,seven_X,2008-08-14T13:25Z,Virus!  Dont bother with this torrent.  THERE IS NO CRACK FOR OBJECT DOCK PLUS.  I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YEARS!
,jamaila,2008-08-18T12:15Z,"hi. . 
i have a problem with this objectdock. . 
i follow all the instructions but then when i open the objectdock plus there's an objectdock plus activation error. 
i am using windows vista home premium.
i really want this software so please if you could help me solve my problem. tnx."
,k00ks,2008-08-18T22:57Z,Excuse me seven_X but you must be a horrible searcher. I have object dock plus and theres no addons. your just looking in the wrong places.
,Skiles,2008-08-27T23:59Z,":( it says theres a virus but im 100% sure that there isnt one... makes me unhappy.
the keygen might work for all of u but it doesnt work for me says there is virus ""zxx"" detected by Stopzilla"
,Hr-jongberg,2008-09-05T19:22Z,"I'm confused, some of you guys say that there is a trojan, and some say that there aint. i tried scanning it with AVG 8.0 it said that it contained a trojan, the keygen.exe to be exact. I have downloaded another version, and it contained a trojan, and it totally fucked my computer up. I just hope this is the real deal."
,T-Minus420,2008-09-10T07:08Z,"the only problem i am running into is that i can't RUN the keygen/crack windows keeps telling me i need sufficient permissions even when i ""Run as Admin"" can anyone help please???? creus??? or can someone just tell me the license?"
,mrmister2,2008-10-13T08:29Z,"I have had this problem with every single objectdock torrent, whenever i extract the rar or zip, the keygen.exe won't be extracted. When i run it from the rar, it gives me an error, and nothing happens if i run it from the zip. Whats wrong?"
,ricky1260,2008-10-28T18:09Z,"my AVG ?????????????

,StunnerYO,2009-04-16T05:37Z,"I know there a fair bit of controversy about the keygen ( contains a virus/does not ) 

But, seriously can i just get a response does it or not? 

Maybe its just y'all anti-virus' pick it up cause its a keygen. i got that alot with kaspersky ... "
,dap0pe,2009-04-18T23:13Z,"listen guys, the reason its being detected as a trojan is the entire reason your not able to get it to work. a program as simple and old as subseven could be used to make a trojan and all you have to do is be connected to the internet, (ignoring the trojan warning) and execute the program. if it works, its because he binded it with the actual keygen, your lucky but, your still infected. he has all your info to take over your computer. but if you get these recurrent errors or administrative errors, your still screwed even if the program doesnt launch. all you have 2 do is double click the file and your screwed. 

PERIOD

dont be stupid guys, listen to your anti-virus software!

and yall can trust my word, i used subseven to mess with my friends back in highschool. so i know how trojans work and how to configure the server and bind the trojan with mp3 files and shit so you would hear the song and not even know your infected. 

eventually i grew up. and dont do that shit anymore lol. so take my advice and dont download this torrent!"

,cryfx,2009-05-20T14:16Z,works great!!!!!!!!! :-)))
,flamingfuzzy,2009-06-11T02:33Z,"Of course it shows up as a virus.

This is my third time downloading this program, and I have ALWAYS had it show up as a virus... But that's just how Anti-Virus programs view keygens

It will always read as a virus, doesn't mean it is."
,tyrelleze,2009-07-21T07:29Z,"WTF This works fine.. If you have an antivirus and you try to open the keygen obviously it won't open.

im running on xp sp3

,ruruman2,2009-07-26T06:09Z,"heres a tip....... i scanned this whole thing and it only picked up the keygen. temporarily disable ur antivirus and download and install it. after, just turn it back on."
,reaperofdeath6x,2009-08-04T01:25Z,yes people trust your antivirus software if it says its a virus then it is becuase i have over 300 keygens that are not infected and had to delete 20 that was i run eset nod32 which is the best on the market now to my opinion so trust your antivirus software thanks please check my torrents that i will be listing soon they will be 120% virus free with serials and or keygen woth them becuse fuck people that trys to harm other peolples shit uncool
,Criss786,2009-08-13T00:00Z,Can some1 give the  Product Serial Number so that we can end the controversy and get r work done too without the virus......................

,73_tm,2010-01-03T04:29Z,"Pretty fuckin sneeky.Everyone that doesn't think that this is a peice of shit virus and that creus is is a swell guy and that the keygen is the red flag TRY This.Open C:User/Your name here/App Data/Local/Temp.   Now run the objectdockplus_190 self ex. Take note of file, that appears in the Temp file. Open file that appears in temp named IXP00.TMP. Now there should be 2 files located here.The one that is named Object. is suppose to be there.Now for all the non believers go ahead and open the (setupct) and let me know how that works out for You??"
,ProjektFUbaR,2010-01-14T21:53Z,"Everyone that says this is a virus is wrong.

Keygens almost ALWAYS show up as viruses with pretty much ANY antivirus..."
,keringe,2010-03-17T02:15Z,"Ya'll niggas be tripppin, every single antivirus will pick up a keygen as a virus, because no antivirus wants you to illegally get a program for free."
,AWal_,2010-03-25T10:52Z,AntiVir says Dialer...wow...It's a false positive though...This happens with embrace all the time...I remember Nero BITD was notorious for having false-positive keygens from embrace.
,JNeal2k9,2010-05-02T04:28Z,"Well, I'm not really sure about all these trojans and shit. I'm am on here testing software. So if you guys want to know if your gonna get infected and hijacked, just set your firewall to close all connections. If the software dosnt work and its crap after you get everything installed run the antivirus delete the program, and then run a registry cleaner. You should also reset your modem to change its IP. Just start>run>type cmd> ipconfig/release>unplug router>wait 10mins, plug back in, and you should be ok. Or just dont download shit from the internet, as I do. :D"
,LoonyJ,2010-05-30T00:37Z,"Are people really so stupid that they can't tell a real virus from a false positive? Listen up people. Keygens have a coding that resembles a trojan virus. Does that mean that it is a virus? No. Does that mean that your AV is gonna say it is? Yes. False positives happen all the time. It is up to you to decide whether or not it's real. If you are in doubt, Back up your primary drive on an external one, and run the keygen. If it fucks up your computer, restore from the backup and you will still have all of your files, not only programs. If you are a chicken shit bastard, then get off the torrent page, and let the real pirates get what they want without so many unreasonable complaints.

Peace,
Loony J"
,Rsslone,2010-07-08T03:30Z,"This isnt a virus... my norton 2010 says it was but when i turned autoprotect off everything worked out, as in i have objectdock cracked. its just that norton thinks the code in the keygen is a trojan... in any hostile means it would be, however its just writing a crack so its not... great work Creus"
,MrPirate8,2010-07-11T17:45Z,"Hi, allrnrnI hereby confirm that this runs perfectly on Windows 7 x32. This download is also virus free (Tested with up-to-date version of Kaspersky Internet Security 2011).rnrnThanks for this download creusrnMrPirate8"
,sphiryx,2010-09-02T14:10Z,"For those ""epxerts"" here saying the Keygen will always be deteckted as a virus: Ever heard of a rootkit you fools? There are many ways to hide a process using special kits so no scanner would ever detect any malware installed on your machine. OK, some keygens are packed using specials compression techniques but they'll show up as heuristic packer or something like that but definately NOT AS TROJANS!!! Once you have launched the keygen they'll download more components from the net. Even if the actual keygen might not contain any code which can be used to take over your machine, the downloaded code and sofware CAN. Ever thougth about how those script kiddies build up their bot-farm and why you always have to run that generator with administrative rights?"
