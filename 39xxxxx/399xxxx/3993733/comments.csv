,darklemming,2008-01-25T19:11Z,what is on this? I don't understand the description.
,impetuous,2008-01-25T20:13Z,"DESCRIPTION: 3 hours of insanity, direct from the nuts themselves. Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, John Travolta, and Kelly Preston are all there in the front row clapping away. If this video, direct from the Church of Scientology, doesn't scare the living daylights out of you, I don't know what will. Good luck, Anonymous."

,modustollens,2008-01-25T22:12Z,"If scientology was that good of a doctrine it would not need to be be marketed by mere actors.

Frankly I suspect that these actors know about as much metaphysics, theology and ethics as my plumber does.

but a breif message to 4chan. i like 4chan, but i find users of aforementioned site to be caustic and hateful. Let me elaborate, if i post a tech question, and reader knows answer, reader will not answer- reader will hate. Also, if i post pic of girl, and user does not want, user hates on me. Plz unify and dont hate on PPl trying to help the cause. "

,DarkRabbit,2008-01-29T10:40Z,"TO ALL ANONYMOUS!

This video contains the use of NLP. Research NLP before watching - or you will be under the ""spell"" of it.
NLP is a craft that has been developed over decades and is srs business.

Look up Kenrick Cleveland, and learn all he has to Teach. 

PROTECT YOUR MIND!

Kick some ass, Anonymous!"
,Shenchi,2008-02-19T17:06Z,"Ok in a nutshell here goes;
Scientology is a religion started by SciFi writer L Ron Hubbard (his belief was that the only way to really become rich was to start a religion and charge your ""flock"" for the knowledge of the religion).  
The sad thing is this so called religion is robbing people blind with promises of a better understanding of the world around them.  Some people who have opposed Scientology have actually died and in some cases of rather peculiar circumstances.
Please remember in Scientology strength of character is not a trait you find in alot of these people, if you did they would not be sucked into this greed stricken mob mentality that they showcase when someone opposes them.  
Be cautious and remember that anything worth putting your faith into is not going to out right demand your money to expand that faith.
Thank you for reading ^_^"

,jimjesus,2008-04-26T01:25Z,"Who's fucking bright idea was it to encode it in the worst format possible? Bad enough I'm forcing myself to watch this trash, but I have to do it in quicktime? FUCK YOU!"
,prasnto,2008-08-08T21:41Z,"This is encoded with the H.264 codec, a free codec that's superior to XviD. You do NOT need to use quicktime. Open it in VLC, MPC, etc."
