Any ideas?"
,scenerator,2008-01-26T05:37Z,"It seems to be Garmin map image format with one basemap and one supplemental map. You should use a Garmin GPS unit, PPC, Palm or Symbian mobile.

PPC: Garmin Que or Garmin XT

Symbian unit: Garmin XT
http://thepiratebay.org/search/garmin%20xt/0/99/0

Valid map file names:
gmapoem.img (Normaly OEM POI data)
gmapprom.img (Normaly a preloaded map in the unit)
gmapbmap.img (Basemap)
gmapsupp.img (Extra map)
gmapsup2.img (Extra map 2)"
