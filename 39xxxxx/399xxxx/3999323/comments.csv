,HyperPete,2008-01-28T04:42Z,Sorry!  System shutdown...  reseeding.
,mattesq,2008-01-28T10:29Z,A lovely FZ gift. Thank you Pete. Vale Demonoid.
,HyperPete,2008-01-30T03:10Z,"I am seeding this non-stop - no peers shown.  I can contact Admin and ask them to delete, I'll re-up, or, try downloading the torrent again to see if it kicks off.  

Shellsunder - I am envious of you meeting FZ - I consider him to be my ""hero"" - Unique, unafraid to go against the norm, and endlessly creative.  He is, IMHO, one of the most misunderstood and underappreciated artists of the current age.  

I have a huge selection of FZ videos and Albums (CDs), I will work on uploading these.  Feel free to contact me directly.  

Cheers.

,mattesq,2008-02-04T09:43Z,"Alas shellsunder it appears we're the only ones who seem to care at this point. I'd say our primary sharer has, as we say here in the antipodes, ""shot through. Damn and blast! I'm stuck on 98.8%. You?
Pete...maaaaate! Come back! Frank would want you     to spread his genius far and wide."
,mattesq,2008-02-05T10:37Z,Ahhh... Frank beams with satisfaction. Seeders up to the yinyang! Thank you fellow FZers. 
,HyperPete,2008-02-17T14:54Z,"Sorry it took so long.  My system kept crashing.  Time for an overhaul!  I'm glad so many people are still seeding.  Thanks, and RIP FZ...
