,DryKid,2008-02-04T08:45Z,"Many thanks to you trickyricky! I've only just watched the first four and then realised that a fifth series had just aired so you're a lifesaver! And the quality seems pretty good too, despite you downplaying your abilities!"
,Vembi70,2009-04-12T08:08Z,"The quality was fine, and the series was great! Thanks! I've only found this one and Messiah I. Anybody have Messiahs II-IV?"
,jh3141,2011-05-05T17:20Z,"Messiah II has recently been uploaded here, but the only sources I've found for III and IV are on thebox.bz, which is a registered-users-only tracker."

Indeed excellent quality for a VCR rip.
Messiah1-4 are also on the Piaratebay"
