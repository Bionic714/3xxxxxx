,corebe,2008-01-26T05:45Z,"I appreciate the effort with your textaloud but it will never replace the meaning by inflection of the human voice...I'll be waiting for a human voice version but once again, thanks."
,Blackhawk1969,2008-02-03T09:48Z,"I have read quite a few audio books myself into mp3 format on my computer..it is much better than TA, like the guy before me said..no inflection in the voices...very good effort but i would rather hear the book read by you than a computer. i have three of the drizzt dourden series read by TA and its ok at first but after a while i find my self paying attention to what im doing and not the story :) and i cant have that at work ;)"
