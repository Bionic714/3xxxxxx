,adsbaer12,2009-04-22T11:44Z,"here is what i did after finished downloading:

first: continue seeding this torrent!

second: extract the entire archive to a folder of your choice

third: create a batch-file and paste the following lines:

==========

@echo off
title WAIT !

Set ""sourceDir=C:\thelocationoftheextractedarchive""
Set ""destinationFolder=C:\Windows\Fonts""
Set ""_report=C:\logxcopy.txt""

IF NOT EXIST ""%sourceDir%"" (echo.Could not find %sourceDir% &GoTo:done)

:: overwrite previous log
>""%_report%"" (
      echo.%date% - %time%
      echo.---------------------------------------------------
      echo.
)

:: copy files
For /F ""Delims="" %%! in ('Dir ""%sourceDir%\"" /b /s /a-d 2^>nul') do (
   @echo.%%! &(
   @xcopy ""%%!"" ""%destinationFolder%\"" /i /y /h /f /c >>""%_report%"",2>&1)
)

:done
title,Done.......

echo.&pause>nul

==========

this batch file will copy all files from all subdirectories to the windows\fonts-folder without creating new subfolders. so there will be no copied folderstructure in the windows\fonts-folder! :)

this is not my batch-file. i strubled across searching the internet. thanks to the original author.

have fun!"
