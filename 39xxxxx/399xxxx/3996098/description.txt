Linkin Park Discography
MP3 @ 224Kbps-320Kbps (Only one album is 224Kbps, the rest are 320Kbps)

I took all the Linkin Park albums I found that were encoded in the FLAC and ripped them into MP3s at 320Kbps. 
The only album I could not find a FLAC encoded album was "Collision Course". The highest quality I found (with seeders)
was at 224Kbps. I saw a 320Kbps one, but no seeders. I wanted two days (kept my computer on) but no luck, I am sorry.


Albums included:
(2000) Hybrid Theory @ 320Kbps
(2002) Reanimation @ 320Kbps
(2003) Meteora @ 320Kbps
(2003) Live in Texas @ 320Kbps
(2004) Collision Course @ 224Kbps
(2007) Minutes To Midnight @ 320Kbps
