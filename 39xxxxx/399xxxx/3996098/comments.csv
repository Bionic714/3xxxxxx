[T],Aufseher,2008-02-04T00:13Z,"I like a few songs of theirs, but I have a nasty habbit of downloading the whole discography even if I want a few songs. That and this is for people that like this stuff and want good quality. Once it got a good amount of seeds and I past my 5.0 share standard, I deleted the torrent and data from my computer. ;)"

,TheWalkingDead,2009-06-18T21:32Z,"I just created a way bigger Linkin Park discography torrent. It's on 2,8 GB!!!! Not kidding... the only thing I think is missing on that one is Splitting The DNA (because most of them are Grey Daze and HT EP that are included in the torrent already) as well as Live at SoHo (iTunes Exclusive) EP. The last one is bought on iTunes and is protected. Don't think it'll work on other computers.
