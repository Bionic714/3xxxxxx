Something's wrong :-)"

  There is nothing wrong. Believe it or not. Picture and sound quality is A-OK. I've ripped quite a few movies and some of these older titles rip allot smaller than we would think. I don't know if it has something to do with the way they are encoded on the DVD or what. If I had set my software to rip this movie to 700mb, then that is what it would have done and you wouldn't have gotten any better quality, but you would have spent allot longer downloading. Instead of trying to rip to a set number of mega bites I use the different settings in the software to try to get the best quality and the smallest file size. I wish I could tell you I was some kind of ripping genius, that's why it's 465 mb.  But truth of the matter is that's the way it came off the DVD.
  Thanks for the comment. And I certainly don't blame you for questioning the file size. But give it a try. You won't be disappointed.

Thanks!
