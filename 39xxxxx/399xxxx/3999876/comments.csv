,CakeMonster,2010-11-22T16:05Z,"I waited so long to get the commentary on the episode Condemned

But the problem is that Peter De Luise a Great director brought his friend Garry who plays the technician Walter and of course Garry as usually totally ruins the commentary just as he has done on all previous commentaries he has been in

You can almost just almost get Peter to start commentating on the society in the episode but before that thought process has even begun Garry comes in and of course just gets Peter way off track

Damn that Garry, damn him to HELL!"
