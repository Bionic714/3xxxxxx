You can log on a see a  Macromedia of the same thing I am uploading. Just CLICK ON the link and pick the Hatsu basho 2008 - Jour (NOW the day you want) - Makuuchi. This is SCREEN RECORDED and about 640x480 quality ( so so ) but does included Japanese sound commentary and should be a quick download with a few seeders. 

Hope you enjoy SUMO LITE and if you do, PLEASE SEED!


Ugly sumo to start - but the last few were GREAT! WOW!
