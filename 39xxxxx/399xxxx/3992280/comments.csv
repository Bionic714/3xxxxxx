,albinoz,2008-01-23T20:43Z,thanks !!!
,bradfantin,2008-01-23T21:35Z,"works great thanks, if u already have installed a previous canybar 3 kracked app, no need to put the plist in that folder, i just replaced the .app and workes great"
,spargett,2008-01-24T08:26Z,"Thanks, works great. And like bradfantin said, if you've already replaced the preference file and blocked the app via LittleSnitch, you don't need to worry about replacing the pref file again. 

Just drag and drop the app : )"
,skidogallard,2008-01-25T04:41Z,Thanks for this upload.  CandyBar is working great!
,dontsteelwarez,2008-01-25T13:36Z,"dont use the downloaded 3.1.2 from the panic website!!!

they have added the sn included in the crack to a blacklist inside the app ;-) so it wont work anymore!"
,oresi,2008-01-27T17:32Z,Thaank!ss
,[[[[djinn]]]],2008-01-30T15:47Z,"this works great...I used apple firewall to block...

just add (choose block) before you start candybar

thanks "
,bluestar888,2008-01-30T17:05Z,Doesn't work for me. Deleted the candybar one from panic site and added this one to applications on Leopard. I closes automaticly
,LilSnoop40,2008-01-31T03:41Z,i downloaded this program copied that file to the folder and it still says expired. i downloaded that little snitch to block it and no go... what am i doing wrong.. thanks
,zipkat,2008-02-08T08:18Z,same here :(
,[[[[djinn]]]],2008-02-13T02:40Z,"this will not work under the new 10.5.2 update...
but here is how you make it work....

download from here

open to run the demo...it will ask you if you would like to update...click yes...

goto user(this is your account)/lib/pref folder and replace with one that came with this torrent...

enjoy...

do not forget to little snitch, block from apple firewall or just turn off the internet when using..."
,Helsabot,2008-02-14T16:23Z,"OK, I did all that (update, put the .plist file in Preferences folder, disconnect from internet) and it just says that my trial has expired.  Am I missing something?"
,nutriaposita,2008-02-17T21:12Z,"Confirmed working on 10.5.2 having replaced the prefs file, as explained by [[[[djinn]]]]. 

Many thanks for this!"
,masob,2008-03-14T18:33Z,"is there a serial crack for this app, i replaced the plist, but it wont let me carry more than 250 icons, and stuff..."
,masob,2008-03-14T18:53Z,nm it worked when i tried it again
,TAVI1988,2008-03-15T16:06Z,"i have an other problem: it's on japan!

what did i do wrong?"
,Odrag,2008-03-17T15:10Z,"It say's expired, and want a serial"
,[[[[djinn]]]],2008-03-19T06:48Z,"no serial needed...

if it says expired, just replace it again...that should do the trick"
,michelasso,2008-03-20T16:42Z,"This is driving me sick. I have 10.5.2 with the latest security update. I followed all steps suggested various times as suggest by [[[[djinn]]]].

Starting from scratch I get in the top a yellow band saying: Unqualified system! Update Candybar or proceed at your own risk"". And it is in demo mode.

I do the upgrade, with Little Snitch temporary enabled, it updates fine but still staying in demo mode (250 icons limit and 14 days left)."
,[[[[djinn]]]],2008-03-21T04:40Z,"michelasso,

hmm... I wonder if there is a .plist in you system library? i would goto lib/ pref and look to see it is one in there...if so, just delete... when you added the .plist from torrent, did you installing into your account lib/pref folder? i doubled checked my instructions and it said that it was expired, but i quit candybar and re-installed the .plist in my account lib/pref and then it worked.

i hope this helps"
,triedge,2008-07-04T14:14Z,"erk, my macbook is now 10.5.4, and the CB says Unqualified System, update or blablabla... 
Should i update the CB or just wait? "
[T],nobody2007,2008-07-10T12:16Z,"some serials for this one? Hope that works

,bradfantin2,2008-09-15T05:29Z,"if the app ever tells u your trial is up, just replace your app and plist file with this one over and over again every time u get this message. it workd for me just now, btw this should only hapen about 2 times a year idk y  it does tho"
,1ofthe100richest,2008-10-14T03:10Z,this aint working on leopard 10.5.5 wont work without updating and also it needs a serial which should be activated once online :(
,iCondemned_88,2008-12-03T15:47Z,"Seed please people! I really need this, and want this so badly! PLEASE!!!!"
,coop26,2009-01-02T00:15Z,Thanks a bunch. Seeding to the leeches of the world
,si77hay,2009-01-02T10:36Z,"Just got it to work fine with 10.5.6, and Buy Now removed.

- Copy Apps, allow to connect to net and run latest update.
- Copy plist to Preferences.
- Get Little Snitch to then block comms"
,dynamitesteel,2009-01-25T13:17Z,"in the torrent world there are two kinds of providers... whole dicks, and big dicks that know how to make torrents... well ur the second"
,harianto,2009-02-01T18:33Z,THanks It works for me. Wonder what is awsome icons to have. hmmpf :D
,corten23,2009-02-02T23:30Z,"it works for me! thanks!
fyi copy the com.panic files and then you're okay to update"
,YOUNGSUMMA,2009-02-24T05:59Z,"PEOPLE THIS WORKS.
I JUST DID EXACTLY WHAT HE/SHE SAYS TO DO.

THE PATCH FILE HAS TO GO IN ""YOUR"" ACCOUNT PREFENCES FOLDER. NOT IN MACINTOSH HD PREF. FOLDER. "
,iPerphekt,2009-03-06T11:50Z,"Thanks a lot!

First time I did this, it told me my trial was up.  I deleted the app and anything related to it.  Then I reinstalled the app and everything else works fine."
,bobbytomorow,2009-06-15T12:10Z,"works perfect just drag to apps, let it update then quit out of candybar go to your security settings and block candybar in firewall from incoming connections."
,tigz54,2009-07-07T19:01Z,"just to clarify for people, the readme says to copy the .plist file to /Library/preferences

YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO COPY IT TO users/library/preferences (it will ask you to replace  a current file. say yes)

also like the file says you need to deny with little snitch"
,alec801,2009-09-21T06:49Z,"it doesnt seem to work when u upgrade to 3.2.1 for the snow leopard version, but you can keep 3.1.2 and from what ive seen it works fine."
,AgtBAUER,2010-08-31T04:47Z,"What the fuckkkkk. Ive followed the instruction exactly 3 times now and it still says its expired. Someone need to make a video of how to do, cause its beyond me why it isnt working"
