Classic Descent series by Parallax software :)


CD images for Descent 1, 2, and 2: Vertigo:

* Descent 1 is MS-DOS only.
* Descent 2 and Vertigo is MS-DOS and Windows 95 (installer won't work on x64).

Also contains Descent Mission Builder II, Descent 1 levels of the world, and some other crap that came on the CD's.

D2 and D2V CD images are in NRG format to keep the redbook (CD) audio in tact.



*** For best experience, use the MS-DOS versions - in DosBOX if required ***

The Windows 95 version of Descent 2 doesn't seem to work as smoothly, plus redbook audio never works. Vertigo doesn't always work correctly on the Windows 95 version either.


If you like this, try Terminal Velocity and Fury 3 too :)
