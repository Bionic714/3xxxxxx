The Elite's Master Plan
Broadcasting live from the studios of KLBJ in Austin, Texas, George was joined by filmmaker and activist Alex Jones, who discussed his film Endgame and the Elite's master plan to dominate and oppress humanity.

Jones warned listeners about a 'control-grid' that is being put in place by the Elite to monitor and store information about the masses. The infrastructure of the system includes RFID chips, GPS-enabled cell phones, national ID cards, and DNA databases, he explained. Jones pointed out that Tivo and Google currently monitor television and internet viewing habits, and have compiled detailed psychological profiles of the people who utilize their services.

Jones commented on the subprime mortgage crisis, which he believes was engineered by the Bilderbergs. He said the group planned to "pop the subprime mortgage bubble" in order to unravel the U.S. economy and bring down global financial markets. He also spoke about the North American Union, the Elite's plan to reduce the world's population to 500 million, as well as the cervical cancer vaccine, Gardasil. Jones referred to a Daily Mail article about two girls who died following their Gardasil vaccination.
