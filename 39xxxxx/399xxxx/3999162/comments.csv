,roykeano,2009-05-30T22:05Z,"The book, which is essentially trainspotting 2, is fucking brilliant. Looking forward to this audio edition."
,drunkenmixer,2012-05-22T16:14Z,"while I thank the uploader anyhow, I was very disappointed when I discovered how abridged it is. I noticed it right away because one of my favourite lines was missing from the first chapter. The reader is excellent but the text is horribly massacred. If anyone knows of an unabridged version PLEASE post it. "
