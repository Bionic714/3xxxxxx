   Decisive Action is a modern Division and Corps level simulation that
   depicts combat with maneuver brigades and battalions along with supporting
   artillery, airstrikes, electronic warfare, engineer, helicopters, and even
   pysops units. Units are depicted with official NATO symbology, and US Army
   official map control measures delineate the battlefield. Scenarios include
   Germany, SouthWest Asia, and the US Army's National Training Center.

   The unique military feel of Decisive Action sets it apart from any previous
   commercial wargame. Decisive Action's ability to represent modern combat
   and the Army's planning process led to it having recently been selected by
   the US Army Command and General Staff College as a training tool for
   officers.

   Decisive Action includes a full set of Unit, Map, and Scenario Editors that
   allow the user to create their own battles. The simulation has numerous
   play options such as Play Against The Computer (AI Mode), Play-By-E-Mail,
   and Network (Internet and LAN) Play.

      assumes that the game is already installed then. 
   
      After that is done, unzip crack.zip included in first zip file to
      where you installed the game. Run DA.EXE to play.
