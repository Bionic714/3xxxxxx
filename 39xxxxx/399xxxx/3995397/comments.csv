,Horrido666,2008-01-26T02:23Z,"Seems to be working okay here.  I'm running vista.  When I installed, I ran the setup as administrator.  After the setup was complete, I unzipped the crack, copied it into the program's directory in explorer, and ran da.exe.  Give me more info, and I'll try to help you trouble shoot."
,Jeffzilla,2008-01-26T05:42Z,"Having trouble with this one.  I launch the .exe, and the program says it is looking for previous installations, then stops working. How do I get around this?

Thanks!"
,Jeffzilla,2008-01-26T20:25Z,"Still can't get this one to go.  I have tried on two computers, and the program still looks for an older installation. Crack not unpacked.  I may have to surrender :)"

Shame really, guess im gonna have to buy this game."
,xebz,2008-01-29T03:37Z,"""Okay, managed to find the problem: because of a virus, I did not have full administartor rights, so thats why it did not find a file.""

No, that cannot be it."
,xebz,2008-01-29T04:05Z,Problem solved. Acording to the HPS website the problem is that it wont run under the c:\program directories in vista. You should install in c:\HPS for example instead. It will work then. =)
,Jeffzilla,2008-01-30T03:05Z,"Back again :)

Still not getting this program to go.  I am ""un-RARing"", hitting set up, and the program looks for an installation and quits. I tried in on a 3rd computer. No other DA exe's in the way.  
"
,xebz,2008-01-30T09:53Z,"Jeffzilla: You must have unpacked the crack in that directory aswell i belive. I expirienced the same problem when i did that. The crack is a seperate rar-file. Try to run the setup within your unpacking program (winrar?) and dont unpack the whole thing. Make sure you have deleted all pryor instalations and unpackings.

No luck on patching, the crack replaces the patched .exe file thus flags within it are incorrect and the game wont work. There is no crack available for patched versions im sorry to say.
"
,xebz,2008-01-30T10:36Z,"On second thought you can try this when patched...

But be adviced! It might fuck your system up! IvĂŠ scanned it with all kinds of online AV software and came out clean but i dont know... Use at own risk!!"
