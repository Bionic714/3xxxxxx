,chimpakawanzelu,2008-04-09T07:26Z,"HELP.  All of these avi files are the incorrect aspect ration (at least on my computer - Vista 32bit; Windows Media Player v11).  They appear to be3:4 instead  of 4:3.  They're compressed horizontally.  Tried changing the aspect ratio in the media player, but no luck.

Anyone else having this problem??  Or know how to fix it??  Thanks."

did you try VLC?  or Vista Codec Pack?

it should work on them :)"
