Thank you for sharing. On your info part of this torrent, you missed several important data such as your torrent source (retail or custom made), region of your dvd, Pal or Ntsc, audio, and subtitles. These are more crucial than data on the movie coz everyone could just google it. Nevertheless, thank you very much on your first effort!!!"
