"
,Straydog1st,2009-10-10T01:51Z,"Excellent, thank you :) !

@ ikke535
For each language you want, just double click the PROOF.MSI on the first folder. Then, go to the SP1 subfolder and double click on the executable file, the only file in the subfolder.
You need WinRar to get to the compressed files."
,A_Black_Tulip,2009-10-23T12:37Z,"ONE FANTASTIC UPLOAD !

For who's asking: These are languages packs that contains grammar & spelling checker for languages other than englishf for Office 2007."

,losamfetaminos,2010-01-19T14:25Z,"I successfully installed the German and French packs, but the Spanish, Russian and Portuguese packs keep telling me that the PROOF file is missing. I unpacked the files via WINRAR in the download map. Afterwards, I have tried the Proof.msi file, but it keeps telling me that files are missing. Can someone please help out? I tried everything, even downloading the torrent again and retry the whole process.

Thans in advance!"

Thank you."
,Aranarth711,2011-02-07T09:51Z,"Works like a charm, thanks!

@miszz
If you want the Dutch pack, extract the *dutch.rar to your desktop. Open the map, run the .msi file (the executable one). After that, open the submap SP1, and run the executable file. It should work then. I installed the dutch, and it does"
,mo10se,2011-05-18T12:11Z,Tack!!! Lätt att installera och fungerar utmärkt!
,Byrjas,2011-07-13T03:45Z,"Hello, just wanted to say for those using Vista Home Premium and having the same problem as I did. ""System has set policies to prevent this installation"". You need to turn off the UAC(User Account Control)
You go to:
-Start(bottom left corner of your screen)>Control Panel>User Accounts and Family Safety(On Control Panel Home view, not classic)>User Account(Just press the title""User accounts"" not the options below)>Turn User Account Control on or off, click to turn it off, restart then follow the steps mentioned before mine, like unrar, press the Proof installer then the update on SP1folder and it should install, it did for me anyway. Remember to turn UAC on again once you're done because it helps protect your computer, it's really important that you do.
Thx again for the upload Joker I hope you get what you give 10fold :)"
,firstheel,2011-12-07T18:52Z,Thanks a lot for this excellent dl.  Grateful  for that mate :)
