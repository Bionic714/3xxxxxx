,mjoys,2008-01-23T09:47Z,Thanks. Trailer : http://www.boomtrailers.com/view.php?id=95
,stateofdreaming,2008-01-23T18:12Z,720 or 1080? I'm hoping 720 as more people are able to play this and as a result more people downloading.
,Armstrong14,2008-01-23T19:01Z,Is this really HD?!  or was it converted to that?  That's friggin wicked!  I wish I had an HD player... :( hah
,spunky1a,2008-01-23T20:49Z,720 is for vhs-user...
,Herminator64,2008-01-24T13:31Z,"spunky1a is gay. Most 720p rips are better than the 1080p rips as 1080p rips are full of macroblocking. you also need a big screen to see the differenc between 720p and 1080p.

720p is the wy to go with rips, 1080p only from blu-ray/hd dvd.

720p rips with 4,5mbits to 8mbits are great if done right! Resolution is only a smart part of picture quality. Exampel, the piooner 508xd plasma beats every fullhd lcd out there!"
,stateofdreaming,2008-01-24T15:02Z,720 or 1080???????
,killerbunny2009,2008-01-27T12:44Z,Sorry been sick .... and as the wife does not reset uploading after reboot ...... btw it ain't fake ....
,Boroborodelamtoro,2008-01-27T15:37Z,"Plz seed.
Availability 0.78, no seeders.

Thnx"
,Boroborodelamtoro,2008-01-27T17:00Z,"Almost everybody seems to be stuck on 25,6%.
The seeders (4) have upload rates below kbit/s!

No fun."
,volksbank,2008-01-29T20:43Z,"at this rate, it will take 4 years and 237 days .
This is really a bad ass bunny ."
,gringr775,2008-02-05T04:06Z,HD DVD at 11 GB? fake or not? or 1080p
,RxRacer7,2008-02-10T11:00Z,"KillerBunny - No-one seems to be able to download the complete file.  I understand you wanting to defend yourself, but your best defence is to seed the file to completetion so at least one of us can confirm it's genuine.  

I know you've been sick, but it's been nearly 3 weeks and we can still only get 27.3% of the file.

There does seem to be anywhere up to 5 seeds at a time, with the ip suffix 'available.above.net', but no-one can connect to them.  They are constantly seeding complete copies amongst themselves, but everyone else is stuck at 27.3%

I personally believe you, I think it's real.  Unfortunately that doesnt count for #$^$ if we cant download it.

Yours sincerely,
Frustrated."
