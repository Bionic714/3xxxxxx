,lawl3713,2008-02-03T17:10Z,well it would have been great if the .cue did work :/
,RegularJoe,2008-02-04T05:51Z,"I'm not sure why the cue is not working for you. 
It's a standard format cue file. It can be opened using notepad if you want to check out the song times. "
,lawl3713,2008-02-04T18:39Z,time codes dont work for me it just split in 2 sek long files and last file on 78 min 
,RegularJoe,2008-02-05T08:38Z,"If you are having trouble with the packed cue file try this.

Convert the whole mix into a BIN file format. Then mount the BIN & cue in Alcohol 120%. This should circumvent any problems you are having now.

If you continue to have problems you can split the tracks up manually once you open the CUE file in notepad to get the appropriate split times. "
