   In 1809 the Austrian rulers sought revenge for their defeat by Napoleon in
   1805. Led by the capable Archduke Charles, they invaded Bavana in an
   attempt to destroy the scattered Army of Germany. Can Napoleon arrive in
   time to unite his men or will his army be defeated in detail?

   The historical battles of Abensburg, Eckmuhl, Teugn-Hausen, and others are
   covered in this game. Using a Napoleonic tactical game system, this game
   has both individual battles and a campaign game. It includes a Campaign and
   Scenario Editor that allow the user to create their own battles and
   campaigns.

   The screen view has both 2D and 3D isometric versions and numerous play
   options such as Play Against The Computer (AI Mode), Play-By-E-Mail, and
