,ivoalmeida,2008-10-05T23:05Z,Didn't work on a DVD90. Instructions?
,bobstarella,2009-01-12T21:49Z,"Confirmed as working on a CD70.
Instructions:
1) Burn to a CD using Nero
2) Eject the existing CD from your Navi slot
3) With the ignition on, insert the burnt CD in your Navi slot
4) CD70 should recognise the disc and ask you if you want to perform a software upgrade. It will show you the current and new software versions
5) Accept. Upgrade will begin and system will warn you NOT to turn off the ignition. Do NOT start the car, switch off ignition or press any buttons.
6) Upgrade takes around 12-15minutes and % complete is shown on the display. IT TAKES A LONG TIME - DO NOT PANIC!
7) Once complete, CD is ejected and system reboots. You will lose your saved radio stations but keep your saved Navi locations."
