,KingsKustomz,2010-01-30T09:28Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD... I was using Norton 360, this program worked but my machine started having wierd errors... I fixed my computer and started using Avast Antivirus... It detected a virus, and deleted the program. I redownloaded it, and as soon as I use WinRAR to extract the files, it gets to 99% and detects a virus... It sucks because this is the only installable Mitchell software on TPB that I know of... If anyone else knows of a good MOD application, please post a link or send me an email. My email is kingskustomz@hotmail.com. Thanks guys!"

,lostwitness,2011-08-02T21:53Z,"Thanks for this! App + Mitchell 1st Q 2009 files run beautifully. For those wondering or getting errors (e.g. ""there are users still connected.""), this app only works on XP so far as I can tell. I've tried compatibility modes under Windows 7 and all have failed to load the app. "
,reldvs1,2012-08-02T01:36Z,"anyone know where i can get ver 4
