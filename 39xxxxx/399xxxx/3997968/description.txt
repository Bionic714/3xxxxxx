Whether smoked, snorted or injected, methamphetamine - commonly known as "crank" - counts more users than cocaine and heroin combined. In addition to exhausting social agencies and draining community finances, meth also leaves in its turbulent wake addiction, crime, burn victims, neglected children and toxic properties. Educational and compelling, CRANK: DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN measures meth's devastating impact on one Tennessee town. The documentary examines meth's introduction as a deadly drug phenomenon, profiles legislation aimed at controlling the sale of meth-precursor cold medicines and reveals the hard lessons families learn about addiction.
