,RoninVamp,2008-08-04T23:55Z,please seed!!! 45 grave rocks and i wanna spin them in the club
,pidgie1,2010-01-07T23:46Z,"Hey, thanks for these, DeadGrrl.  They are hard to find.  Don't feel guilty for downloading freebies - 45 Grave doesn't make a penny off the reissues.  I know Don Bolles and he is usually ass broke.  If you want to pay for this sh*t, find him and put some money in his pocket.  BTW, saw 45 Grave (minus Bolles) recently at Knitting Factory and they were AWESOME!"
