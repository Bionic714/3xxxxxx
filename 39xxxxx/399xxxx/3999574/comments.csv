Can some one please seed seed seed this , as nobody is seeding this anything more than 2 seconds a day, Just please seed over night"
,winston000smith,2011-06-07T03:28Z,"Just had to say a BIG thank you to the people seeding this. VLS is an underrated genius whose material could be forgotten if it was not for sites like this and the people who take time to seed.

Needless to say, I'll definitely seed.

Cheers!"
,winston000smith,2011-06-07T22:58Z,"Much like Pressgang up there, I'm now stuck on a very frustrating 85.1%.

I'm not going to bang my fist on the desk and get all stupid and self righteous about seeding, but if someone could find the time to get seeding I'd be a very grateful man.

Being able to get hold of legendary obscure stuff like VLS is one of the best things about this file-sharing lark.

Please kindly seed this wonderful stuff if you can. There are millions of people seeding crap films you can get hold of anywhere, it's the obscure stuff you want to be seeding to prevent it being forgotten. 

Get involved People. This isn't just shit, this is actually worth sharing.

Obviously I will be seeding whenever the PC is on from the time I get these precious files.

Cheers to all for your time. :)"
,winston000smith,2011-06-09T22:06Z,"BIG THANKS to everyone for seeding this. It took 3 days but I got there in the end.

Gotta go and burn these to discs now but will be seeding loads very soon.

Cheers All! Especially that hero in New Zealand who left it seeding all night. "
