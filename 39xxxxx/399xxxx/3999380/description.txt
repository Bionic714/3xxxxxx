Emir Kusturica is one of the most influential movie maker from Balkans. Once in the 80Â´s he joined a band called No Smoking Orchestra. He made one record with them then left. Later the band split into two parts. One part stayed in Bosnia and one left for Belgrade. While working on his movies he asked the Belgrade version to do the music for it and since they lacked a bass player he jumped in. This are the three records with music from and based on his films. Also as always you lot get a bonus. A live record from Buenos Aries. Hope you like gypsy music because this rocks.
