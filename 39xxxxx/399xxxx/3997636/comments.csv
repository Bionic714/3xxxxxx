,bdougher,2008-12-22T16:08Z,"There are about 53 of us that are stuck with 77% of this torrent downloaded and no seeders to get us the rest of the way. Please come back seeders we need you. When I first started the download it had two seeders and all was well, then they dropped out. I am sure that you know how frustrated it is to have a 4.93gig file and can only get 3/4 of it. So this is a plea for help.
Thanks -bdougher"
