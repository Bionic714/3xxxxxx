Season 1 of the PBS series.  I had nothing to do with encoding these.  The original tracker seems to be defunct (iPodTVNova) so I'm hoping this keeps the torrent alive.  I have low bandwidth, so please seed once you have the whole thing.  Here's the info from the original uploader:

Show Info.........: Curious George (2006) PBS - Season 1



Plot: The tale of Curious George is sweet and basic. George, an 

African monkey, is being raised by the Man in the Yellow Hat. The 

Man in the Yellow Hat tries very hard to care for George, however, 

complications frequently occur, typically George's naivety and 

curiosity get him and others into trouble.



The Man in the Yellow hat is typically able to save the day. On the 

rare occasions that things are beyond the Man in the Yellow Hat's 

control, George comes through and rights all wrong (usually George 

is the cause of the wrong). In the end, because George is just a 

helpless, innocent little monkey, everyone realizes that he is sorry 

for his actions, and they forgive him for causing trouble.



For over sixty years Curious George has been entertaining and 

educating young people. The concept of Curious George began as a 

series of children's books written by Margret and H.A. Rey in 1941. 

The books were immensely popular with children because George 

possessed so many child-like characteristics, and the plot was 

so basic and innocent.
