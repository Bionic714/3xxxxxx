"Build 70 is now available. Pick up your computer headset and start calling your dearest friends... for bug hunting! Over 100 bugs were fixed in Build 70, and we've introduced MSN voice calls as well. As with Yahoo voice calls, you may notice delays and call lag with MSN calls; we are aware of this issue and will be addressing it once we finish our audio implementations across the board. For now, please ensure that calls are connecting successfully. Enjoy the build!"
