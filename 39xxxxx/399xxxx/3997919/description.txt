 The Oak Ridge Boys Discography 1977-1993.
 128k MP3s.

 Here are 20 albums from The Oak Ridge Boys, included are all of their MCA albums, except for 1982's "Christmas" and 1986's "Christmas Again". Also here are 2 of their 3 RCA albums, "Unstoppable" is missing.

 All of this has been SOURCED FROM THE CD RELEASES of these albums. The MCA CDs go for quite a bit these days, especially the first few albums. They are collector's items and hard to find. It is nice to have these albums here in the best quality sound. (I SHOULD NOTE: As best as 128k mp3s can sound) As an added bonus we have William Lee Golden's "American Vagabond" album from 1986.

 If anyone has the missing three, please upload them if you can. Then, when can join all of these recordings together into one torrent.

 Enjoy this release, and SHARE. If you are grateful to have this, be kind to others and SEED. If it wasn't for someone's kind efforts towards you, you WOULDN'T have this.

 If you DO like these recordings, please let the Oaks and MCA/Univeral know. Many of these albums were available only briefly on CD circa 1986-87 and have been MIA for years. Help put 'em back where they belong!

 Lots of goodies here, all of the hits of course, including their last big seller, "No Matter How High I Get", which has suspicously never been comped... a #1 hit... MCA, what were you thinking?
