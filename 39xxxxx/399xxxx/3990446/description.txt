Radiohead is certainly not the first pop act to receive the "classical" treatment. Artists such as the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, Frank Zappa, and Metallica, among others, have been covered with varying degrees of success. The challenge for Christopher O'Riley is not simply concocting classical stylizations of Radiohead's music, but translating the group's powerfully distinctive sound into transcriptions for solo piano. The good news is that O'Riley succeeds in conveying the scope of the band's richly textured sonic assault with virtuosic arrangements that do justice to its unique musical perspective. His evocative arrangements of songs such as "Knives Out," "Karma Police," and "Let Down" bring their intriguing melodies and harmonies into sharp focus while still retaining the mood of the originals. It's a testament to O'Riley's abilities that he's able to communicate Thom Yorke's singular vocal style through the keyboard, most notably in "Subterranean Homesick Alien" and "Exit Music (For A Film)." He also deals effectively with the tunes that are built around the band's triple guitar onslaught. In "Airbag," for example, the powerful riff that drives the song takes on a Lisztian majesty in O'Riley's hands. Familiarity with Radiohead's music is not a prerequisite to enjoy this excellent disc. It will appeal to anyone who appreciates superlative musicianship.
