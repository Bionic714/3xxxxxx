,PXT0R0,2008-01-27T05:28Z,didnt mean to get you upset but what i said was that the editing was bad....and it is. the commercial breaks are awful and seems to be put together in a rush. its watchable so dont get me wrong.....im just a firm believer in taking pride in ones work and with video editing it doesnt take a genius. i guess i should be grateful so yay thanx.
