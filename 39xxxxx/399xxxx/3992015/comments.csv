,geoscopic,2008-02-22T16:05Z,"Could someone upload the mac release, REALbasic 2007r2 2007r-5, that pacman_55 provided the sn for as RealBasic does not offer that version as a download anymore."

Check ftp://ftp.realsoftware.com/REALbasic2007r5/"
,geoscopic,2008-02-24T20:43Z,"Yeah that dawned on me after I posted the request, now I'm afraid they will see the ftp access and lock it up."
,ikkeikke,2008-02-27T10:46Z,"For Mac version 2007r5 just download version from the ftp and use the following key:

Username: r k
SN: H78JL4XV-GMTSBKDC-9KMHM5W3-32NGMFPU-RB600CPFUSA-MAC

Tested!"
