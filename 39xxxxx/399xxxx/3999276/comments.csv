,Mysticum81,2008-03-12T05:05Z,"I'm still downloading, so I won't comment on the actual quality of these videos.

However, IF the audio is out of sync, all decent media players should have the ability to adjust the audio/video timing. Look around in the audio options, and you should be able to find somewhere that'll let you enter a delay (negative or positive) for the audio.

Just takes a little tweaking to fix. Not the end of the world, and certainly no reason not to be able to watch a video."
,red-thunder555572,2008-03-14T02:07Z,season 1 - 3 are excellent quality no probs with audio or video thx dude ive just started downloading season 4 please keep them coming!!
,joe180,2008-04-17T03:08Z,Are these Xvid or DivX? I already have some DivX rips but would like to play them on the 360 (which doesnt support DivX 3)

,Joetheodd,2009-12-12T04:26Z,"I added this torrent November 26th, and have so far downloaded 900MB. I've uploaded 9GB. Quit just leeching torrents."
,mrfr0g,2010-03-03T20:29Z,"The Quality of this rip is really shitty. They are 350 MB episodes but appear similar to 70 MB files for mobile devices.

Sound is extremely bad and sounds like a wide range of the sound spectra has simply been removed.

Encoding is crappy. Jumping / forwarding in the video creates artifacts that only disappear after 5-10 seconds, really annoying. (Using VLC/Mplayer)

Has this been ripped form old VCR tapes? It definitely seems so."
,teoroman,2010-03-23T00:55Z,"Good job, AndyPod. "
,scoobs5973,2010-05-08T00:05Z,Thankyou for the up!

,GodspeedYouRyan,2011-05-08T23:29Z,I don't know what mrfr0g is talking about. These videos look and sound great to me. No sync issues either.
