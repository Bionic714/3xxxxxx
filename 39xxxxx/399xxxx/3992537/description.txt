Alderman Bright returns to blackmail Weaver into treating his gay lover for syphilis (off the record, of course). Unfortunately, the man dies from an allergic reaction to penicillin and Kerry is forced to cover up her mistake. Things between Abby and Carter have cooled down following Carter's aborted marriage proposal, but they soon heat up again. Luka has a very unconventional therapy session. Romano's condition forces Anspaugh to replace him as chief of staff...with Weaver.
