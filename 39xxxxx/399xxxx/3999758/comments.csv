Anyone who knows what region code it is for this torrent? 
Tried to upgrade it to 1.3.2 but got a mismatch with the region (country) code. Tried with UK, US and Swe downloads but i seems to be another. "

,doctorgordinho,2008-07-20T07:30Z,"Thank you very much for this very valuable upload. It scanned virus-free (3 different programs) and installed like a dream. Your instructions are clear and to the point.

Haven't tried to upgrade yet, but I did try the software on some NEF files that I shot yesterday and the software worked like a charm!

Thank you again!"
