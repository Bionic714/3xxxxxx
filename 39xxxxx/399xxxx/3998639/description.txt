Me personaly thinks this show is freaking awsome, although i love almust everything with guns end blowing stuff up and what not... enjoy

An entertaining and upbeat, mostly factual and undeniably cool show to watch about the future of weaponry. The host is a former US Navy SEAL and he uses easy to understand language. This isn\'t a show dealing strictly with the US military, but instead it crosses international boundaries while offering a look at truly astonishing weaponry.
