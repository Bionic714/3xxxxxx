,Nedus,2008-04-05T06:49Z,What is this Xvid-D734 crap?
,oharaandrewlp,2008-05-26T22:11Z,"it is simply telling you the codec that was used to create the AVI file.  In this case the files are xvid's

so you'll need to find a codec that will play these files, or download VLC Media Player.

Hope that helped.

BTW: Scottfry1988, you are an asshole.
You too BoringName666"
