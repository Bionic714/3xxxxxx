In this one-off documentary, Antonio Carluccio went on a pilgrimage to Italy with a Renaissance cookbook for a guide. He investigated the life and recipes of Bartolomeo Scappi, a chef who cooked his way through the events of the sixteenth century, masterminding memorable meals for cardinals, emperors and popes, before publishing his illustrated bestseller at the age of 70. Antonio delved into recipes that are more than 500 years old, cooking eel in Venice, porcini mushrooms in Lombardy, and stuffing a suckling pig in Rome, where he ended his journey with a banquet fit for a pope.
