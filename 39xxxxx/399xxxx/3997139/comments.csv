That's the problem with lots of compilations like this, until you've downloaded and listened you cannot tell. 
No disrespect to the original seed, it is a good set for those who are not as picky as I am! I was a DJ for 35 years and worked in radio, so had to have the original versions. I'm still looking for odd interesting tracks, hence downloading this batch."
