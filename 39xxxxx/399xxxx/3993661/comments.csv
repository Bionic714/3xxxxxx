Bad Section"
,pepethecat,2008-01-25T15:06Z,This app is useless without a startupdisk. 
,scottyarch,2008-01-25T15:28Z,"Actually it's not. Though the disc is useful, it's not necessary at all. For one, this works great on external volumes and, if you're clever, you'll install it on an external volume that you use for maintenance on your internal drive. It's faster than booting from CD.

That being said, this is now out of date. There's 4.1 out now with 100% Leopard compatibility."
