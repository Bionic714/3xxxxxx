Another award-winner from Barcelona, In the city (En la ciudad) tells the intertwining story of a group of adults (30+) with many personal secrets: Single Sofia lives her life in fantasy by compulsory, unconscious lying; Thomas has a secret affair with a teenager student, married Irene finds herself attracted to a woman who seems much more in tune with her than is her husband, etc.

Rather sensitively written and directed.

Spanish audio.
English hard subs.
