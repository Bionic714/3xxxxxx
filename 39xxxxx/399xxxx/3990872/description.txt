[for Windows XP only]
Remove WGA is a small utility that enables you to remove the Microsoft Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications tool

RemoveWGA will enable you to easily remove the Microsoft \"Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications\" tool, which is calling home and connect to M$ (Micro$hit) servers every time you boot. Futures updates of this notification tool will (officialy) setup the connection rate to once every two weeks.


######YOU SHOULD GET THIS IF U ARE USIN\' A PIRATED OR CRACKED WIN XP!!!######



note:
Some antivirus and antispyware programs flag RemoveWGA as being infected/malware, although the application is perfectly safe and does not pose a threat to your system. This is called a \'false positive\'. The term false positive is used when antivirus software wrongly classifies an innocuous ( inoffensive ) file as a virus. The incorrect detection may be due to heuristics or to an incorrect virus signature in a database. [Similar problems can occur with antitrojan or antispyware software.]


NO SPYWARE/TROJAN SERVERS/KEYLOGGERS/VIRUS OR OTHER SHIT!
