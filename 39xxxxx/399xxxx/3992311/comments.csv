So I found a way to get it working in Vista.

The patch needs to be on a local hard drive (I.e, not a network location) and then you need to right click and go to Properties. Then in the Compatibility tab, tell it to run in Windows XP SP2 compatibility mode.

After that, it'll work fine.

Thanks for the upload."

,eyteconart,2009-03-16T22:30Z,"patch doesn't work for me either.  Still says ""buy now"" when you publish the page.  I found on another site where someone said you have to remove a file that's added to the ""root folder"", but can't find it.  Can anyone help, or will I need to scrap all the work I did in this program?"
