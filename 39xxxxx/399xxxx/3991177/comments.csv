,MagiciansFR,2008-01-23T00:08Z,Is this the 3.0 installer?
,S0iLw0Rk,2008-01-23T00:34Z,"this is the most updated Installer, whatever the version number is."
,angel1,2008-01-23T04:03Z,"vague response, it is 3.xx and above or not?"
,carlosrajas,2008-01-23T06:43Z,"oh yeah soil, i follow angel is this the v3 ?"
,S0iLw0Rk,2008-01-23T20:41Z,"Just looked, yes it is."
,willywoo2,2008-01-24T00:15Z,Please; do we need an activation code?
,angel1,2008-01-24T02:45Z,"Unloader, why are you lying to all of us? this version is 2.0.8.1A...You make me waste my time,  shame on you..."
,PhaRxMer,2008-02-01T16:19Z,"I hate to say it, but this is a common problem on-going with Rosetta Stone software. VERSION MATTERS bigtime. Version 3 is 10x the software version 2 is, not to mention each language pack is FULL of improvements.

The latest version of Rosetta Stone is v3.0.35 - 11054. This verison ahs FULL Vista support as well as it also does not require any CD to be mounted to operate the language packs. You install and go, no CD required. Two language packs have been floating around out there. Spanish Levels 2 - 3 (Level 1 was included but the CD was corrupt for every single user that I know of. I think the group posted the release this way) and Russian Level 1 - 3.

I have a full functional version 3.0.35 with crack I will post. I hope seeders will stop supporting v2 language packs and start trying to find v3 packs once I release this. Please consider it. Why everyone continues to adopt v2 is beyond me."
,frankiefour,2008-03-03T21:10Z,Does anyone have the real functional crack for the latest version of Rosetta Stone is v3.0.35 - 11054? I tried to install Italian 1 but it doesn't work. Does it depend of the version of the language pack?
,HarpGuy,2008-03-27T18:59Z,"Not to my knowledge.  The crack, I believe, works for all languages.  I only have Spanish (Latin American) levels 1, 2 and 3 (for Rosetta Stone version 3) running... and using the crack referred to in the earlier post.  It's working fine.

However, it's inelegant.  It kicks an error message in various places... not during the actual use of the product, but during startup, attempts at activation, etc.  There's also a ""wrapper"" error (at least in Vista) upon closure of the program.  So the crack's not perfect.

But the crack accomplishes its primary task:  Making all lessons in all language levels work the same as if the program and language packs were legitimately registered and activated.  And that's all that matters.

Is the crack referred to in an earlier post not working for you?  What's the symptom?"
,demodonk08,2008-03-28T20:05Z,Which crack are you referring to HarpGuy? Do you think the crack would work for OSX as well? Or do you know where to get an OSX version of the crack? I can  only do the first two lessons of each language pack currently.
,sphynix06,2008-06-23T19:46Z,Does anyone have a MAC installer for rosetta stone v3?
,grey_mouser,2008-07-23T01:56Z,Can someone please tell me how to install these rosetta stone programs?  How exactly do I burn it with powerISO? Sorry for the ignorance...but I would greatly appreciate some help. Thanks!
,blackhats,2008-07-24T06:30Z,"grey mouser - look up - erashaddon's - torrents for the main program and related patches. I added some instructions to the ""patch"" torrent that you will need. Copy and paste the instructions in notepad or Word doc and place them in your main RS folder."
,asgard67,2008-08-03T14:35Z,it is not v3 its 2 u suckers
,EmmaWatsonLove,2008-09-19T00:30Z,"so how does this work, i downloaded it, then what, i know how to use power iso, but do i need a patch or a crack for it?"
,njf106,2008-12-08T13:50Z,"Will this work on vista? I downloaded it and when i tried to run the disk got this:Error executing file
E:\setup.exe
The requested operation requires elevation."
,xChristinaRIOTx,2009-06-01T06:04Z,"Is this compatible with Vista?
