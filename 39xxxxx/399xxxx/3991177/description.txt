This is the main installer disc for the Rosetta Stone program.  This program is needed to use the language discs.  

Since this file is a .iso.  You will need "PowerISO" in order to open it and to burn it to a disc to make it work.  Once downloaded completely, open it up on PowerISO and insert a blank data disc to your drive.  Once in there, burn or mount the .iso file onto that disc and download the setup + install it.
