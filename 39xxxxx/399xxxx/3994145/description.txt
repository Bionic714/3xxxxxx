Before installing CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X4 

Make sure that your system Date/Time are set correctly. 
Close all applications, including all virus detection programs and applications that are open in the system tray or on the Windows taskbar. Not doing so may increase the installation time and interfere with installation. 
On XP, you should be logged in as an administrator or as a user with administrative rights. 
Make sure that you have enough free disk space available on the drive where you want to install the application. 
To avoid file and memory conflicts, close all running programs and delete the contents of your system's TEMP folders. [C:Documents and Settings<Administrator>Local SettingsTemp] and [C:<WINNT>Temp] 
Corel recommends that you install CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X4 in its own directory to avoid conflicts with previous versions.
