What a pity that most files are not completed"
,ssss129,2008-05-26T06:08Z,"Broken torrent :( 
No seeds"
,ferdambi,2008-08-19T17:48Z,"Hi punktyras,
Is there any reason you abandoned this torrent?
I noticed you are keen to seed new ones, but looks like you do not care about this old one.
Since mid of June more than 250 peers are stuck on 49.5% so maybe it would be nice if you would at least slowly feed them the remaining part. 
Anyway, I do not know why the tracker info remains at one seed, misleading users, if the seed actually has gone long ago. Maybe it's time at least to correct it?"

,Mitch_Bainwol,2009-04-22T08:03Z,"So one book is incomplete. They are individual files.

,mistergroenevingers,2009-09-06T19:39Z,"hi there
well here's another one at 99,9 percent
am only missing 2 packages
I am wondering though...
you're not trying to hack me are ya?
keeping me close to finish so you can snoop on me for as long as I'm hanging round
I think I'm getting a lil' paranoid with all these books I'm reading ;)"
,mistergroenevingers,2009-09-06T19:47Z,"I have a feeling that there are never going to be anymore seeders on this one
it was originally uploaded somewhere in january 2008 and the original seeder and the others who had it since then have probably moved on
even though tpb says there are 3 seeders, those figures never ever seem to be correct
noticed this from my own torrents in the past
still this is worth the download
can always try to get those two books that aren't complete elsewhere"
,dstar101,2009-09-26T11:14Z,"Hey!!Thanks for the books
Do you have 2008 version of C# and VB books.Please post i need them"
,RegisteredJust4input,2009-10-14T09:34Z,"ok this is my first comment. 

I tired of getting viruses and hopefully people will take example of this and do as i did. I decided to register because people that care more about taking advantage of other peoples computer instead of remembering why this sytem was created in the first place.

so, all i have to say is 

THIS FILE CONTAINS VIRUSES



however i did delete them and im not going to tell you how i did because personal reasons.

at the same time you may be wondering if im a person that cares  to post to help others of a fake that post to trick or pose as a person to benefit the person who made this torrent.

so im going to write this comment on every torrent i have found viruses so that you know that i am a person same person and a person who has downloaded of searched google to see if this contains a virus.


SO, DOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RETARDED RISK. "
,odobo1,2009-10-28T17:56Z,"haha there are so many people at 99,9.  

This guy punkytras is an asshole."
,rekabis,2009-11-29T01:51Z,"I have been trying to ""fill in"" the last two files (which I have been able to do with other bittorrent downloads). I have found the FreeBSD chm file, but the Java PDF is zipped up, and I have been unable to zip up another copy of the PDF so that it is acceptable to the checksum. Therefore, I cannot become another seeder by manually completing the files. Has anyone been successful in contacting the original seeder?"
,rekabis,2009-11-29T02:01Z,"Come to think of it, I have been using 7zip to try to roll up the Java PDF. Perhaps the original tool wasn't 7zip and used another compression level/setting? At any rate, the default 7zip settings ends up with a file size of 2,207Kb, whereas the original zip has a file size of 2,210Kb. I don't have the time, but perhaps someone can examine the zips in this torrent, and see if there is a common compression program and determine what settings it used? If I knew that, I could manually complete this torrent and become another seeder."
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-02T12:09Z,"rekabis 
i know exactly what you are trying to say but trust me... it is impossible. btw it is better to become this way to make this torrent never dead to 0%. this torrent will be alive 99.9% forever...."
,FuckSholihin,2009-12-02T12:13Z,antiviruses are very annoying since they have added those ebook into their database as a `virus'. i hate that.
,Marv70,2009-12-05T20:06Z,"OK, I?ve been, like the rest of you waiting (setting at 99,9%) for several days. How to finish and start seeding but for two files Foundations of Java For ABAP Programmers (2006).pdf.zip and FreeBSD 6 Unleashed (2006).chm. If you would like to finish at 100% and you don?t care about those two files, do this > go to > Files > Select one of the two files > Right click on it and select ?Don?t Download? > do the same with the other file and you will start uploading at 100%. You may want to delete these two incomplete files from the downloaded file after you finish uploading. The 99.9% good, complete files are great and Thank you for them. marv70  
"
,rekabis,2009-12-15T07:17Z,"@FuckSholihin

Actually, my method is very doable, assuming you do in fact have the exact same files that the submitter put into their torrent. I have done this multiple times with large multi-episode AnimĂŠ torrents? if the torrent has no seeders and one or more have missing chunks that prevent me from reaching 100%, I just find the episodes elsewhere and shoehorn them in (reverifying the torrent in the process).

The key thing is, however, that they have to be the exact same files, down to the very last byte. Easy for large individual multimedia files, more difficult for zip files that could have been compressed using any one of a dozen or so different programs (and therefore, a dozen or so different compression amounts).

And that is where the problem here comes in. If I knew which compression program on what platform made the zip that contained the Java PDF, I could re-create the zip with a high probability of getting it exactly per-bit-identical.

After all, I can at least try. If it is not per-bit-identical, the hash that the torrent is verified against would cause that zip to be discarded anyhow. Which is why it would be impossible for me to introduce a virus this way, btw. A single bit off, and *poof*, the zip gets rejected because it doesn't match the hash."
