Any interest?"
,animemina,2008-02-03T07:55Z,"Yes, if it's not too much trouble.  Thanks for TB S3+4 so far.  I've only finished S4 and looked at ep401...excellent quality!

I would also be interested in JLU, but I only see V2 available.  Any chance of making V1 available?

Thanks again for the excellent rips."

[T],2Crazy4u,2008-02-08T03:40Z,"animemina - thanks :) I only ripped JLU V2 because the rest were already available.

slybunda - When I get the DVD's (i.e. next Fall/Winter) then I will rip them if someone else doesn't first."
