,kerasmus,2008-01-28T18:43Z,"HI Joda. thanks again. What program can I use to manage all of those roms? I tried offline list, but non of the roms where reconized?. I like the interface in offlinelist. Sort on region/language, and the ingame pictures. Thanks Keras "
[T],magumagu,2008-01-28T22:52Z,"I haven't tried offline list. I used to use clrmame pro, but did recently move to NDScrc whose interface and functions I like.

Do you use the ADVANsCEne list for offline list? Does offline list work with 7-Zip archives?

Another good app for rom/flash card maintenance is Rominator. Good interface with cover art and fully costumizable iTunes like smart folders.

Both Rominator and NDScrc recognize these roms. Neither work with 7-zips though.

Cheers!

Q:Do you use the ADVANsCEne list for offline list? 
A:Yes ADVANsCEne Nintendo DS Collection.

Q:Does offline list work with 7-Zip archives?
A: No, all my roms is shown as wrong file name. 

Try it. It is very usefull still.
I just changed the colour of ""Wrong file name"" to ""have in collection"" ex. all my ""wrong"" are blue, and all I not have is red.
Get it here http://offlinelist.free.fr/ and/or see some screenshots.
Thanks again

Club Nintendo - Game and Watch Collection DS
3 old school games Donkey Kong, Green House and Oil Panic. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_&_Watch_Collection
I would love to play those games once again."

I know Offline list. I don't think it's versatile enough though. That's why I use NDScrc.

I think NDScrc and Offline list uses different standard naming conventions, which at least with NDScrc are costumizable, which makes the roms appear misnamed in your app. As long as the crc:s check out ok, you won't have any problems.

Btw, regarding Game & Watch, check out:
