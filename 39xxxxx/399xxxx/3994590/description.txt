ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST - 1968

  Sergio Leone out did himself with this spectacular, larger-than-life, epic about how the West was won. The unholy trinity of Italian cinema (Leone, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Dario Argento) concocted the story about a woman (Claudia Cardinale) hanging onto her land in hopes that the transcontinental railroad would reach her before a steely eyed, black hearted killer (Fonda) does. (The film's advertising slogan was: "There were three men in her life. One to take her ... one to love her ... and one to kill her.") Meanwhile, Leone shoots his stars' faces as if they were expansive Western landscapes, and their towering bodies as if they were looming rock formations in John Ford's Monument Valley.
