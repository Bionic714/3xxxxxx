What Wiki says:
===============
Mozart in Egypt is a 1997 album by various artists. It represents a fusion of Mozart's work with the sounds, rhythms and instruments typical of contemporary Egyptian music.
The album saw considerable success in continental Europe, especially France, but had only limited success elsewhere. In August 2005 a second volume (ASIN B0009PEYVW) was released in Europe only, entitled Mozart in Egypt 2.

What EMI says:
==============
Plunge some desert shepherds into a symphony orchestra, simmer together two radically different musical systems, one (Arab) more ?horizontal?, in which events succeed one another in subtle modes, the other (Mozart) more ?vertical?, where a plethora of simultaneous harmonies and counterpoints are superimposed, and sprinkle with a pinch of humour: result, Mozart in Egypt, a magic carpet ride between East and West, conjuring up a shower of new images and sensations. At a time when relations between the Arab world and the West are far from being at their best, Mozart in Egypt offers hope, a rare example of harmonious co-operation between the two cultures. 

Between Volume I and Volume II the interplay intensifies, Mozart?s scores become more daringly orientalised, and the musicians of each camp don each other?s clothes more often. On with the show! Hughes de Courson
