It is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen from Symantec, which I happen to like otherwise. I have never in my 19 years with Macs had so much problems as when I installed this software. And, as of today, it is not needed due to the lack of viruses. Sorry..."

,hockpooh,2008-01-29T00:45Z,"I just use ClamXav now cause all the others, Norton or Virex, VirusScan, bog down Macs way too much. If you want to protect your friends that own PC's from viruses, have them buy Macs, All my friends and family did and they are so happy they have a Mac now.

And Ladybird127, thanks, we Love Germans."

IÂ´m using Macs since years, but I never got an virus, worm or trojan."
