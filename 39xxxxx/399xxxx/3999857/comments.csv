,ela_oana21,2009-11-09T05:27Z,"yes, it is great, but unfortunatelly, it is poorely translated into english. of course the film is easier understood by romanians because of the social context, but but the text itself should have more meaning to anyone if it were properly translated. it's the same problem with the dvd and i whished somebody had the time and skill to do it right! 
anyway, 10x uploader!"

I look forward to this movie, and I am grateful to be able to experience parts of Life unavailable to me otherwise. I hope Romania keeps growing stronger since the cancer of the Ceausescu regime was killed. Long live peace on Earth and goodwill/tolerance for others. Let our people grow!"
