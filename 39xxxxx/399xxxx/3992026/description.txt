Ah, the life of the young single person ... Singles ? Flirt up your Life is the simulation of the 'exciting' relationship between Mike and Linda. The live-in twosome are coupled as roommates at the beginning of the game, though the rest is up to you as the gamer ... They share an apartment, which means that the gameplay has all of the normal routines of cooking, cleaning, going to work, chatting, hanging out, and watching TV. But as the night wears on and the conversation gets deeper, who knows how things will turn! You'll have your chance to play both God and Cupid in this intimate simulation game that also features 15 other characters to meet and engage with.
