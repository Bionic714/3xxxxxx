A quick little low end graphics (Old Style) arcade type of game when you just want a game to play for a few minutes to kill some time.  I based this game on gamemakers streetracing by Mark Overmars.  Drive a 1969 GTO Judge through traffic picking up gas along the way and outsmart the police. It's also very small in size.
