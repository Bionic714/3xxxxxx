Star wars comics are reaching a new plateau in 2008!  

"Star Wars: Vector is a comic to be released by Dark Horse in 2008. It will include the writers John Ostrander and John Jackson Miller, and will cover a single character's journey through the continuities of Knights of the Old Republic, Dark Times, Rebellion, and Legacy. It will be "similar to Civil War in its scope and style."[1] 
The storyline will proceed from Knights of the Old Republic, to Dark Times, then to Rebellion, and finally to Legacy, with each chapter being essentially self-contained.[2] According to Ostrander, it will not involve flow-walking, and the events of Vector will influence all four comics, with the future direction of Legacy being written based on the events of Vector. Jan Duursema will do the art for the Legacy portion.[3] Josh Elliot is working on cover design. (From http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Vector)
