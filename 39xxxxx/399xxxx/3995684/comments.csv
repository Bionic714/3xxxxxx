I know we'd love to have you join us either as your home torrent site or by crossposting you TPB torrents. PM me if you get there! joshua13"
,Ruud444,2008-01-27T13:55Z,Seeed anyone please!!
,Sanctia,2008-01-29T19:41Z,"Thank you. This was exactly what I'm looking for. I've played the KotOR games a dozen times, now I'm just curious about the comics. If I enjoy them, I'll certainly buy them."
,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-01-30T05:31Z,"Your very welcome!  I plan on uploading some more of my favorite Star Wars comics soon, so keep an eye open!"
,Sanctia,2008-01-30T08:17Z,"Falleen, I started reading the comics and number 6 (kotor) seems to be missing, while there is twice number 7?"
,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-01-31T15:37Z,"hmm, that's weird, I checked the folder I originally created the torrent from and i checked my client and it says i'm seeding 6 and 7.  And they're not just mislabeled, but there's just 2 copies of 7?  hmm.  I'll upload a copy of 6 onto sendspace for you this evening."
,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-02-04T20:55Z,"Here is KotOR 6 if you somehow got two 7's.

,djonesocp,2008-02-12T05:51Z,"Falleen is correct - Issue 6 in the torrent is actually issue 7 content and issue 7 in torrent is issue 6 again. The sendspace file listed as issue 6 is issue 7 content too.  This is a fantastic post and I'm surprised not more people have noticed this but I started reading them right away and got stuck at issue 5. Any help (from anywhere, not just original poster!) would be appreciated.  This problem shows up in other torrents as well so let's get it resolved for the readers before it spreads too wide.  Thanks again for all the work, it is appreciated by all!"
,djonesocp,2008-02-12T05:53Z,"Sorry for double post, the first was worded incorrectly: 
Sanctia is correct - Issue 6 in the torrent is actually issue 7 content and issue 7 in torrent is issue 7 again. The sendspace file listed as issue 6 is issue 7 content too. This is a fantastic post and I'm surprised not more people have noticed that issue 6 is missing but I started reading them right away and got stuck at issue 5.

,GMD-JEDI,2008-02-28T22:00Z,"thanks for the good work 
apart from the obvious double 7 
works a treat"
,Luckmann,2008-03-11T09:10Z,"Wow, nice FAIL in messing up the KotOR line of comics. As stated previously, both issues 6 and 7 are, in fact, issue 7.

By far the worst thing is probably that there are so many people that -keep seeding- a borked torrent.

-.-"
,jorj82,2008-06-08T18:26Z,"people like luckmann should stop wasting thier money on internet if all they do is complain.  oh, its missing one file... there's 64 more to read.  "
,disadventurer,2008-08-27T14:16Z,So... where can we get issue 6?
,Leeroyfan101,2009-11-06T22:58Z,"Well this sucks, issue number #6 of The Old Republic is actually issue number #7 and #7 is still #7"
