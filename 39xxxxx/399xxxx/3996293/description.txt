April 7, 1970.  Thirty-one years to the day before I got married.  I didn't get married in Raleigh, North Carolina, though.  The sound quality is pretty amazing throughout - notch your EQ freqs around 370, boost at 1K-16K and just let it play.  A very very nice audience source.  

This bootleg was named American Accents, after a hilarious Plantation fairly early in the show, while Jimmy is taking a (water?) break after sixteen minutes of Dazed and Confused.  It features a blistering Heartbreaker (check the freaking solo) that doesn't sound hurried at all, a 15-minute White Summer,  and a tremendous SIBLY where Robert improvises extra lyrics (after telling a screaming girl to "have a gargle" before the song,) in excellent voice.  Jimmy is especially fluid, laying down huge slabs of tonal chords in perfect synch with John Paul throughout.  And Bonzo, so often relegated to "gives his usual amazing performance," does it again.  Ripping and tear-assing around the arena, the engine room operating in perfect rhythm, every click and whir in perfect synch.

I don't want to give away too much.  Another short show, this one cuts at 17+ minutes of Moby Dick.  An inspired performance - check out Robert on harmonica on Bring It On Home.  Well done all around, band, taper, mastering guy, and Nech, who sent it to me some time ago just 'cause.
