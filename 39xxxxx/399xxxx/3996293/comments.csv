,daved2487,2008-01-26T15:22Z,Thanks Tim. Love your series.
,professorvalley,2008-01-28T04:41Z,wrong date.
,TimD54,2008-01-28T08:43Z,"Man, who are you?  This is another disputed date, venue show - seems like that's a reoccuring theme amongst the best of shows, eh?  The debate centers around the artwork showing a location of Dorten Auditorium, which is actually called something else, and there was supposed to be another show at another venue in Charlotte the next night and this show might be that one, yeah.  This show is listed under the date and location that seems to be the consensus of my research.  If you can prove 100% otherwise, be my guest - I'll be happy to be corrected.  Otherwise, back the fuck up off my series.  The way you've been nitpicking my free series, one would think you'd turn down a free blowjob.  I do my homework on this stuff.  Download it or don't.  But shut the fuck up already.

,TimD54,2008-01-28T23:57Z,"The show is listed as what it always has been.  Copying a Royal Orleans thread is hardly proof of anything, not only as it's a wild-ass guess but anything involving Jason loses credibility, IMHO.  You gotta do better than that."
,professorvalley,2008-01-29T03:18Z,"guess it just goes to show how little of a shit you give about spreading around the best sources and correct information.  jason has nothing do with that ro thread, in fact it's hugh jones and robert godwin, but go on being blinded by hatred."
,TimD54,2008-01-29T09:28Z,"I'm not blind, I just don't see how a couple of guys who weren't at the show can verify that the date given is wrong.  You need to get your head out of Royal Orleans and get it to someplace they do real research.  I know Hugh and Robert, do you?  And they'd be the first to say that this show is disputed, that nobody's certain.  And in lieu of conclusive evidence, I'm not changing anything.  Dick."
,Doomsday1126,2008-04-01T04:09Z,"If you have read 'Hammer of the Gods', page 115, clearly mentions Zepp being in Memphis on April 6, continue reading onto page 116 and you will see where it states and I quote ""Next day, Zeppelin was playing in Raleigh, North Carolina.""
I think TimD has it right here."
