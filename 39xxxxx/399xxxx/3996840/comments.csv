,mrrenton,2008-04-27T09:09Z,"obviously thanks a lot for this!
just wondering why there are subtitles?
It gets kinda distracting becuase they are hard subbed.
I don't want to sound like an ungrateful asshole, but why did you pop them on?"

,jaal1976,2008-12-01T14:11Z,"Decent Rip, interesting documentary. But I have to agree that the embedded subtitles in English which accompany the documentary spoken in English are distracting and a bit useless. Plus, they are really ugly subtitles.

Thanks anyway, but if I find another torrent for this without subs I'll probably download this again."

,Catatonicat,2009-05-31T01:02Z,Thanks a bunch for uploading this great insight into Alan Moore's worldview. The man is a pure  genius and obviously very intelligent. One hour and ten minutes of Moore is a sensible enough amount of time for the general audience; more would just be too much as it requires a lot of afterthought and reflection upon the things he says.
