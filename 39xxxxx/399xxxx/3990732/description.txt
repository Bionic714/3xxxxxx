  Hello, this is my first try at editing and my first PvP movie. I spent some weeks editing, but since my PC is "old school" its hard to record with low fps, and rendering takes ages. So, after a few weeks my first video is done. Don't expect some insane skills like Neilyo, Ming,  Mute etc etc etc... If you do, you can as well just skip the movie. I'd like to read some progressive critics, so I know what i should do and what i shouldn't do in my next movie. 
  The fights are recorded during the HARP age, and after the nerf when i use Shadowstep. I don't like using Prep in duels, so i tryed to avoid it. If you have any questions, you can ask here.

- All the arena fights are recorded ~1900 - 2000 rate
