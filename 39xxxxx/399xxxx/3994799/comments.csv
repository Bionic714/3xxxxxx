,pingpong_me,2008-01-25T15:27Z,is this for the rosetta stone version 2 or 3 ??
,Dybowski,2008-01-26T03:29Z,"No idea, i know that it works though"
,HappyNight,2008-06-07T07:01Z,"There are no v3 levels released for Dutch yet, so these are V2."
,youngscot,2008-06-20T10:04Z,"Rosetta Stone have no plans to release level 3, the guy I spoke to claims that level 1 + 2 will be enough to get you up to conversation level in up to 450 hours of lessons.

Bought as a single package, these programs cost £229, seperately £308.

I've been working on it for an hour a day for about 2 weeks now and I'm delighted with my progress.

I had problems at first but found that it works well with MagicDisc if anyone has problems.

All in all, works a treat. Superb up Dybowski!"
,Vroem,2008-08-11T09:47Z,This is learning level 1 & 2. But what software version is it? v2.x or v3.x?
,randomguy12,2008-09-01T08:10Z,wtf this won't unrar for me. i've never had any problems unpacking anything else for for this it says that the archive testt failed so I cannot use this.
,Banbury,2008-09-09T18:13Z,I have started to download the torrent. I will let u all know if it works or not.
,Draakstraal,2008-10-12T16:39Z,"it can't find a language 
 please help"
,Noash,2008-10-25T18:09Z,"I downloaded and installed it but now I don´t know how to add the language, it says that it doesn´t find it. What should I do?"
,nambiar,2008-11-16T07:34Z,"thank you verry much for the upload, this wuld definitly help me to go for the Dutch language exam abroad for the Imigration purpose.. thanks again"
,randomguy12,2008-12-16T00:42Z,"i just downloaded this. it had a hard time extracting with the program i was using so i used WinRAR. either way, once unpacked and burnt onto a disc, it is detected by the rosetta stone software. however, when any of the lessons are clicked on it says there is a script error. esentially, this is worthless and completely unusable because non of the lessons work.

BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT DL THIS"
,2manydjs,2009-01-14T12:13Z,"Works fine with: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4454940/Rosetta_Stone_Compressed
(couldn't get the included Dutch to work) However you need to keep the CD or iso mounted for this to work."
