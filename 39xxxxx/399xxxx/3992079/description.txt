This hilarious comedy has finally been released on DVD, after being announced at Amazon almost two years ago. It has previously been shown on film channels from very worn and torn copies, the DVD quality is great with original mono sound.

A Mafioso tries to hide out in a hotel which turns out to be a crazy gay bath-house. Superb performances by Rita Moreno (West Side Story) as "transvestite", Treat Williams (Hair) as half-naked soprano, F. Murray Abraham (Salieri in Amadeus) as crazy gay queen - and above all the Andrew Sisters in double drag 
(men dressed up as women dressed up as men). One of the funniest films ever made. 

Burn tested with Nero, runs well in my standalone divX player.
