It is a documentary about the proffessional paintball team XSV from California. It shows who they are, how they got together, what they had to sacrifice to become who they are...

The movie was made by Patrick Spohrer, The Spielberg/Corsese/Oliver Stone/ of the paintball movie industry, who directed and also recorded all the action while travelling with the team for more than 2 years.

H4AD: The XSV Story is a very good movie even   if you're not a paintball player. It shows exactly what drives those people, and what awaits them in the future. There's a lot of good songs in it, good action clips of games that XSV played...

Now, normally I woudn't mind if a movie is available online for free, but this is not made by some major rich studio. It's the work of a man and his small team of friends who dedicated all their time and a lot of money to make it.
BY DOWNLOADING IT YOU'RE TAKING AWAY FROM THE CREATOR WHO MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE. PLEASE BUY THE ORIGINAL @ http://www.monkey-with-a-gun.com/monkey_with_a_gun/Heroes_for_a_Day.html"

If you think about it though, sharing this torrent leads to more exposure and growth of the sport, therefore broadening MWAG's potential customer base for future releases. This torrent was floating around a while back and died...I just put it back out there. 

As far as paintball flicks go, this one's top notch. Enjoy."

this movie deserves to be seen.

after you find out how sweet it is, go buy it and get your MWAG stickers and commentary from Nicky Cuba, Rich Telford, Matty Marshall, and Alex Fraige."
