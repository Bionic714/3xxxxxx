ArtyTorrent Music Production Pack 23-Oneshots-Bass Kick Drum WAV samples 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first of several packs of drum oneshots I shall be uploading in the coming days.
Included here are around 1200 bass drum (kick) samples for use in dance music production.

All samples are 44KHz normalized and trimmed WAVs for use with all major samplers and sequencers.
Programs for FL Studio's DirectWave sampler are additionally included for users of that app. UnRAR the dwp programs into a directory containing the multiple folders to load them up.

These samples are divided into the following categories:

Chicago Fire Deep House
Ghetto Electro
Vengeance Essential Club Sounds 1 - Clubby, Distort, Punchy, Trancy, Verb
Vengeance Essential Club Sounds 2 - Hard
Vengeance Essential Electro
Vengeance Essential House 1 - Hard, Soft
Vengeance Minimal House 1
