,tinapay01,2012-02-01T02:50Z,Use PowerISO to mount the bin file into a virtual drive and install from there.
,Rockeee,2012-03-26T17:58Z,"For those of you who are getting the ""Writing the data failed"" and ""AR read failed"" errors, this is because you have renamed the folder that the game was installed with.

Sadly it must stay as ""DISCIPLINE"" or you won't be able to save the game. So just go rename that folder and it should work without needing to change compatiblity."
