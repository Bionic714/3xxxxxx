Only Yesterday (Omohide Poro Poro, meaning Memories Like Falling Teardrops (more literally, Memories Like Falling Rain Drops) is sixth film by critically acclaimed director Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies) and produced by Studio Ghibli. It is based on the manga of the same title by Hotaru Okamoto and Yuko Tone.[1] It was released on July 20, 1991. The ending theme song is a Japanese translation "Ai wa Hana, Kimi wa sono Tane (??????????, Ai wa Hana, Kimi wa sono Tane?)" of Amanda McBroom's composition "The Rose".

Only Yesterday is significant among progressive anime films in that it explores a genre traditionally thought to be outside the realm of animated subjects, in this case a realistic drama written for adult, particularly female josei audiences. In spite of its subject matter, the film was a surprise box office success, attracting a large adult audience of both sexes.
