Bay Area DJ turntablist Systemaddict puts together one hell of a mixtape on this one. Blending and juggling hip-hop instrumentals with jazz, funk, and soul, it demonstrates the rich musical history contributing to hip-hop, as well as commenting on hip-hop's future. In addition to the innovative and tasteful blends, tight cuts and scratches abound, as can be expected with any Systemaddict release. The following are the Archaeology liner notes:
