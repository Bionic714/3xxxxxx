,artytorrent,2008-01-24T17:25Z,"I must admit that I'd not installed this when uploading the torrent. (I would have repacked it and given extra instructions). I've got it working now though, but it was a hassle, so follow these instructions carefully.
1. Extract Addictive Drums.ISO from the first of the RAR files. Burn the DVD or mount it on a virtual drive.
2. Extract the keygen from air-xlnaadkgn.RAR
3. Install the program from the DVD image on to a hard drive with lots of space.
4. Wait a long time as it copies a ton of MIDI files you'll probably never use. ;)
5. Wait some more time for the factory sound bank to be copied.
6. When installed, boot up your sequencer and refresh the list of plug-ins. Addictive Drums should now run in free Grace Mode for 10 days.
7. Reload the plug-in and click Authorize. Copy the System ID code.
8. Run the keygen. Paste the system ID into the box and click Generate. You will be prompted to save a file called Resources.xpak. Overwrite the version in the folder you installed Addictive Drums.
9. The keygen should now provide you with a serial number. Post this into the auth program of the VSTi. (I had some trouble getting it to accept my key presses until I'd disconnected from the net, but it pasted in the end).
10. Plug-in is now cracked."
,chipxsd,2008-01-28T17:45Z,"Is there any info, if AIR is working on a new keygen for the Addictive Drums update?

http://www.xlnaudio.com/index.php?page=downloads

This version doesn't support the multichannel output in Apple Logic 8. It's very frustrating... But if I try to use the keygen released in this torrent with the updated AD, it crashes when I start it. Probably because I overwrite it with the bad resource.xpak.

ps: This questions comes up a lot on forums: does this torrent release work on a Mac? Yes it does - you only need a PC to generate the key and the resource file, or you can use the Crossover software to emulate windows on your Mac."
,artytorrent,2008-02-02T06:38Z,"Thanks for that information. I can't say I have any information on any updates, but the AiR team usually provides new cracks for popular software like this. To be honest, I've hardly used this VSTi, but it definitely works in this form on my PC at least. Hopefully the issues with Macs will be sorted soon."

,Niosis,2008-03-06T15:56Z,"This does *NOT* work on Leopard.

I followed all of the directions to a T after finding the directory. (A poorly written guide from team air helped add to my frustration of finding that on a mac.)

Anyways, there was no resources.xpak file in the addictive drums directory. Saving the file there did NOTHING.

,theunforgiven246,2009-02-07T05:56Z,"Hey guys, my AV also said all of the keygens were viruses as well.  But after I installed the program if you keep setting your computers clock back to the day you installed the program it keeps saying you have 10 days left.  It has worked for XP and Mac OSX 10.4.11.  I had trouble on vista. So you don't really need a keygen if you can wait out that annoying nag screen!"

Mac HD / Application Support / Addictive Drums. It'll be in that folder. Otherwise follow artytorrent's very detailed intructions near the top of the comments. 
@Artytorrent many many thanks bro. Love this plug, now that I found the damn resources file..."

,honestlyidontknow,2009-10-24T15:35Z,"Thanks Artytorrent great stuff, by the way peeps
dont worry too much about avg thinking there is a virus in the keygen, on mine it came up as runtime packed .fsg, i think this is avg's way of just knowing that this is cracked software.
ie; been useing cubase 3.1.944 for a long time and its never caused any bother, but i had to install cubase from a cd that i put the program on over 12 months ago, 12months ago avg did'nt have a problem with the said cubase version but now it thinks the runtime packed .fsg is also on the cubase, which of course is nonsense because this version of cubase that ive used for all this time has been static on this disc and of course the session was closed on the cd over 12 months ago,best thing i found is to use the keygen to install and then simply put it somewhere else other than on your hard drive so your virus wont winge at you."
,mmilt,2009-10-25T11:04Z,"Arty, sharing your stuff,people like you, make the world HUMAN.THANK YOU."
,NYCRocker,2010-01-02T05:53Z,"OK Mac users, it works and it's easy if you know where to find the xpak. Double click and open your Harddrive, open ""Library"" folder then open ""Application"" folder then open ""Support"" folder then open ""Addictive Drums"" drag the new Keygenerated xpak right into that folder and when it asks if you want to replace?say yes. Here's how I did the whole thing. First you download the torrent and there's a buck of files,right? I used a program called ""UnrarX"" that opens rar files on Mac and i got it right here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3639687/UnRarX_2.2.zip  Next I used Unrarx to open these two files only: air-xlnaadkgn.rar AND air-xlnaad.rar One is the keygen and the other is the program. Next you see the program ISO right there. Open it and the drive icon appears on your desktop. Open that and proceed with the mac installer. After installation I opened Garageband and went straight to Addictive Drums where i had to attempt to authorize without the keygen because computer ID already in place. I copied the Computer ID right in the Addictive drummer ""computer ID"" box. Now?this is way I did it. I pasted the computer ID in yahoo messenger and ""file transferred"" the Keygen exe and sent them both over to my PC. I then copied and pasted the Computer ID into the keygen box on my PC and clicked ""generate"". It then asks you if you want to proceed and you proceed. It creates the xpak and gives you an auto number, you'll need to send both of those back to the Mac and then follow the very first steps above. replace the xpak first, then open your audio program and enter the auto code and BINGO! It works."

,branedred,2010-05-03T04:08Z,"Thanks artytorrent!  Works like a charm.  I took the liberty of editing previous instructions for a streamlined set of instructions.  To install:

TO GET KEYGEN WORKING DISCONNECT FROM INTERNET!!!!

1. Extract Addictive Drums.ISO from the first of the RAR files. Burn the DVD or mount it on a virtual drive.
2. Extract the keygen from air-xlnaadkgn.RAR
3. Install the program from the DVD image on to a hard drive with lots of space.
4. Wait a long time as it copies a ton of MIDI files you'll probably never use. ;)
5. Wait some more time for the factory sound bank to be copied.
6. When installed, boot up your sequencer and refresh the list of plug-ins. Open A.D. and choose register/activation
7 - Copy I.D code and open keygen
8 - Paste I.D code and press generate
9 - The Keygen makes: Recources (xln audio resource) and asks where you want to save it...
save it for example on your desktop and the keygen gives you an activation code.. copy that code.
10 - Close the A.D. VST and the music program.. open the folder where you installed A.D. and copy/paste or drag the resources file into that folder.
C\Program Files\XLN Audio\Addictive Drums \
Your PC will ask if you want to overwrite the the old resources file (which came with the installation).. press: yes.
11 - Open your music program and start A.D. and press register/activation again.
12 - Paste the activation code there where A.D. asks for it.
13 - Press next / finish.
14 - Congratz You've a fully registered A.D. !!!
Turn your internet back on and download some sweet pornography.

,nahoowey,2010-12-26T07:42Z,"A few suggestions:

**VERY Important**Make sure that your DAW (Cubase, Cakewalk, etc.) is running with Administrator privileges.

Right Click-Compatibility- Check Run This Program as a Administrator.

The main problem that I had was getting the Resource file generated from the Keygenerator to take. To do this I did the following:

1. Go through the process of selecting Addictive Drums from your VST instruments in your DAW and authorizing it with the Keygen (copy Computer ID, paste ID in the Keygen, generate authorization code).

2. Do not replace the Resource file with the one generated with Keygen. Save the Resource file in a new folder, exit out of the keygen and your DAW without finishing authorizing Addictive Drums, go to the folder with the original Resource file, and replace it with the Resource file generated by the keygen. Open your DAW up again and continue with the process and this time the Resource file should take.

Alternatively, you could just rename the Resource file during the authorization process to something like Resource2 (although, it did not appear to change when I did this, but it did!) and save the Resource file from the Keygen in its place with the correct name:).

If you like this program, please buy it!

Take care:)"
