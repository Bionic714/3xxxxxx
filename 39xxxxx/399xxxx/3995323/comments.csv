By the way, doesn't matter if you're hard as hell, you will cry at least once during this show."

My big thanks to the uploader for this! :)"

,khangging,2010-02-02T09:16Z,"@ behemut

it only took like two episodes to do so"
,ianmills,2011-04-22T07:07Z,"Another really sad Japanese drama is called ""Mioka""

Its good. I cried every episode (except maybe the first).

Still waiting to recover from that before watching this torrent :-)"
,jagscads,2012-08-09T11:05Z,"This series is like really emotional. :/ I cried a lot like every episode. It gets sadder every one. :( 
But everyone should watch it, it's really good.

Download about 25%, stopped and opened the 1st episode, and the quality is pretty good. I'd say 1280x720, probably. Not mindblowing, but still. 

A: 8-9/10
V: 8/10

Definitely watchable. 
Not bad at all. 

@dunat Yes, it has subtitles, and it's very well translated. 

P.S.: Read previous comments from other users. Might help. :P "
