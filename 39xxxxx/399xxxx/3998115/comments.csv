,PlutoOfPluto,2008-02-17T09:18Z,Thanks so much! Been looking for some Max Webster for quite a while!
,dwaraka,2008-02-19T08:52Z,"And a BIG thank you zaftra for seeding these hard to find albums from a grat band so often overlooked. I saw them supporting Rush in 1979 in the UK. Had 'A Million Vacations' on vinyl, but lost it years ago, so I'm well happy to find it again after nearly 30 years...Agh, makes me sound ancient.
Nice one. Peace."
,HomerJayJay,2008-07-26T20:50Z,Excellent & many thanks...... all sorts became  Toronto Tonto's as a result 
,frankjd,2009-02-15T00:56Z,Niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee !
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-05-23T16:09Z,"@HomerJayJay: Ironically, Toronto Tontos is in their first eponymous debut from 1976 not in these three...

... so I've remedied this by posting the remaining two Max Webster here:

Enjoy. :^)"
