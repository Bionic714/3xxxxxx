,mrdeath.swe,2008-01-22T17:14Z,"Why post if you don't believe in creation? Really, atheism is a religion as well, you have to believe to not believe, in this case Evolution (which is a religion indeed!). Go and promote what you like to promote , instead of spreading your negativity here.   "
,mrdeath.swe,2008-01-23T21:17Z,"I'm sorry but you are confused, and have misunderstood the hole concept. You have to have been everywhere to say that something don't exist. Do you know everything? Of course you don't know everything, but lets say that you know 50% (just for the sake of argument, do you think that God can exist in the other 50% that you don't know about?   "

,Lebowski11,2008-05-03T22:10Z,"I love the easy logical explanation of the evolution theory how everything come to be. I says:
In the beginning there were nothing, absolutely nothing. Out of this existance of nothingness a ""dot"" not bigger than a ""."" on a text book page appeared.  In this ""dot"" which came out of the ""nothingness"", contained all the mass of the univers, so this ""dot"" was VERY heavy.......etc
This is what evolution theory comes up with to explain...well it just gets difficult to explain it without a intelligent beeing behind it all. Well some people just like to believe in fairytails instead of logic!"
,Jonny645,2009-08-31T04:35Z,"""Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking  nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn.  The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.  If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learned from experience and the light of reason?

Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books.  For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although ?they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertions?.[1 Timothy 1.7]""
