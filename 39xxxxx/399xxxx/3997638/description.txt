DVD-rip from The Dvd-version with live fotage from several conserts with  

Kurt Nilsen
Espen Lind
Askil Holm
Alejandro Fuentes

I deceided to make this one as i am a fan of Kurt Nilsen, and that the Full-dvd version is so slow to download here. I also let you get most of the menus to get a better picture of what songs you should expect.

I made it in several parts, so if you just want some songs you dont have to download them all. Look at my parts here, and see at the list further down what songs are in each part.

Part 5, contains  songs 1-8
Part 9, contains  songs 9-19
Part 12, contains songs 20-25
Part 16, contains songs 26-27
Part 18, contains song 28
