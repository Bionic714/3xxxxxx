Synopsis:

Where Nothing Is As It Seems.

The quirkiest thriller since Blood Simple, RED ROCK WEST stars
Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Boyle in an offbeat 
mystery about an average guy who is mistaken for a professional 
hitman. Dead tired and flat broke after driving 1,200 miles, Michael, 
an unemployed Texan (Cage), walks into a tavern in tiny Red Rock, 
Wyoming, and is immediately offered a job. There\'s just one problem: 
the owner thinks Michael is a hitman, and the \"job\" is murdering the 
owner\'s wife (Boyle). Just when Mike decides to take the money and 
run, the real hitman (Hopper) arrives, ready to do the job right. 
Full of playful twists and sexy turns, RED ROCK WEST is a perfectly 
plotted game of cat and mouse that will keep you guessing until the 
final, shocking shot.
