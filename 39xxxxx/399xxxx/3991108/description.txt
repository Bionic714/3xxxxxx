Well, what do you expect, it\'s from Scotland, like me.


A (very) brief history...

After this song was recorded it was mainly passed aroud by hand, on CD,
from one person to another. Then from one workplace to another.

Over time it was renamed, re-copied and worse, to the extent of it being
chopped up into 13 separate tracks on one CD, as you can imagine it lost
its flair after a while.

Eventually it found its way to me, via a certain workplace renowned for
its Whiskey, I\'ll admit the quality was awful like the CD condition but
the song was great.

After many, many hours of work I present to you the full
digitally re-mastered version re-named back to it\'s original title.

A Scottish \'Karaoke\' parody of American Pie.


If you\'re from anywhere in the Central Belt Region of Scotland
you\'ll find this song hilariously true.

If you\'re from elsewhere you\'ll find it funny anyway,
it\'s probably true about most of the big city areas in Britain.


Enjoy.
