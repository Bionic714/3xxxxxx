How do I know? I wrote it!!
I used to play in a comedy band called 'Ted & The Cheesy Lion' where we would take famous songs and rip them off with our own ""west of Scotland"" lyrics. I'll maybe get around to doing a torrent with some of our songs."
,FXD,2008-01-24T03:41Z,"For your information CheesyLion, and I don't mean this in any bad way to you.

While researching the origins of the song I asks two local radio station DJ's who knew the song what the title was and both of them assured me it was 'Frey Bentos Pie' as in the lyrics, I first knew it as 'Glasgow Pie'.

You're also not the first to claim credit for this, I do not dispute your claim though.

It's just that I've received a handful of PM's from folk in another forum, all claiming they wrote it.

One even asked for me to remove it from the net claiming copyright laws, I figured him for a phoney straight away, doesn't know his laws.

To each of them I replied with a simple message...

""If you wrote it & sang it then good for you.""

The reply to the guy claiming copyright was a lot longer, none of which can be spoken here. LOL

Anyway, regardless of these others claiming it as theirs you're the only one who has responded as I'd expect the singer too.

So I say, if you did write & sing the song as I said before good for you and I look forward to seeing more similar songs upped by you & the Cheesy Lions.

I'll certainly be adding them to my collection. ;)

,cheesylion,2008-01-24T06:06Z,"I tried last night to upload our wee 'album' (which includes this song) but I'm fucked if I know how to do it but I'll try again when I get in later. I WROTE and recorded the song about 15 years ago and there are numerous people who could testify to this. As far as ""copywrite issues"" are concerned, I'm actually rather flattered that there are other people claiming it as theirs and that you don't seem to believe me, but I can assure you that you HAVE found the author. In fact, I'm not even bothered that it's being played after all these years. The radio stations and whoever else you asked are only as good as the information they have and in this case that information is wrong.
BTW, you are ""singing"" the song too much, it was only ever meant to be done in a more 'spoken' way as you'll see when I can get it uploaded."
,cheesylion,2008-01-24T06:21Z,"Ah, I think I've susssed it!

,FXD,2008-01-24T16:35Z,"Thanks for the link Cheesy, much appreciated. ;)

I must point out something, it ain't me singing on it, I work on the other side of the glass if you know what I mean. :D

As I mention in the description the song was given to me on a CD with a note to 'Clean it up!' attached.

After working on it so long trying to get it sounding right through the studio I know that this is probably a single guy singing the lyrics to your song along side a Karaoke machine playing American Pie, you can hear the original song chorus in the background.

As for the other claimers, I've had more sent to me since I last posted here, they're starting to get annoying to be honest & hilarious at times too. LOL

Once I've downloaded your Album from the link and heard the original I'll not only be able to put an end to all these claimers but also give my friend (boss), who gave me the CD in the first place, a copy of your album, so he can take that to Australia instead of the re-mastered one.

I'll leave a comment for you, on your album's torrent page, once I've heard it fully.

Once again, thanks Cheesy. ;)


A note to all those downloading this song and/or the album linked by Cheesy Lion above...

Please keep seeding for as long as possible after your download has completed, this is the tradition of bit torrent, it is what holds the community together and stops folk screaming out for seeds! Thank you.

,FXD,2008-01-24T16:50Z,"Forgot to put this above...

Cheesy I didn't say that I didn't believe you, quite the opposite. ;)

""you're the only one who has responded as I'd expect the singer too.""

In order to be sure I had found the Author I had to see what your next response was going to be and you've done exactly what I hoped you'd do. ;)

No other claimant even bothered to offer up the original album, most complained that I no right to post it up without their permission, one of the latest guys even asked for money or he'll sue me. LOL

Now you know why it's getting annoying receiving these PM's. ;)

My final hope is that other folk don't just 'Hit n Run' on our torrents and leave them with not enough good seeds.

Till next time, take care.
