,binary_10essee,2008-12-06T08:49Z,"Well, I can't guarantee it will work, but a while back I downloaded a Hypersonic 2 torrent (H2O Release). The dongle emulator says it works for Hypersonic, Cubase, HALion, and a bunch more. But I downloaded Cubase 4 and it didn't work. So instead, I downloaded Cubase 3, and it works just fine. So maybe you can find H2O's Dongle Emulator? Just a suggestion. =)"

,thamesmead,2010-01-23T00:29Z,"I'm trying to install this. I get message: 
'msvcp60 is not in windows/system32'. I think its something to do with the syncrosoft thing.
It is there...I'm stuck now..anyone know a workaround?
I'm planning on using it with the AiR release of Cubase 5 which is already installed."

,Arthas66,2010-05-07T09:32Z,"Hi,

Thanks for the torrent. It took me a long time to download it with this slow internet!  I have a problem though. 
1-First no serial. Than kodowda posted it.  It worked, I installed the complete software. But there is one more problem now. 
2-When I run the software it loads a few seconds than dissapears. I than installed the update. When I load it there is an error.  I guess it has something to do with the license control program, but the strange thing is Halion 3 is located in the list of the license control, with a bunch of other programs.  It is the license control that I installed with Cubase Sx 3.  I guess the Halion 3 one is not a proper one.  
    I have a dongle USB that I purchased with an original Steinberg program before.  When I plug the dongle in my computer Halion 3 asks me to get the proper one.  So I open the license control download to install it to the dongle.  But I need the activation code!

If anyone has the activation code, I'll use it to download the license control to my Steinberg USB dongle, and plug it to my computer.  That should solve my problem and let the software run normally.  If kodowda you have the serial key, can you please give me the activation code.  It would be majorly appreciated. 

If anybody else has a different solution or a proper dongle emulater plz let me know!

Thank you!"
,Arthas66,2010-05-07T09:38Z,"mk13 you don't have the activation code or another solution? sorry for being persistent, I really need this software. Thank you."
,flames_of_mordor,2010-07-07T10:53Z,open ISO in RAR and you will find a crack or serial.
,daithi81,2011-06-06T14:26Z,"I followed the instructions exactly, and it simply doesn't work. The software doesn't find any license on the emulated USB dongle."
