Two days before that I got it shut off for dling sweeny todd...  Try to run your shit through an anonymous proxy browser."

Second, when these pricks and bastards contact COX, they always send you a duplicate email, and you gotta respond to this immediately, not to paramount (And Paramount would not be interested in this film anyway cos its Universal) -But you respond to Cox and you REFUTE these bastards.

Some SHITHEAD from I think it was NBC tried to get me shut down because I had the Scarface game on my PC, I was able to prove with documentation, that the file I had on my PC was NOT a film, Not owned by NBC but by Sierra the game company, plus I was able to show ILLEGAL ENTRY to my computer.

OUR COMPUTERS are part of our LIVING ROOMS and Houses, and NONE of these fucks have ANY LEGAL RIGHT to dig through our PERSONAL files.

Once I showed the reasoning of this to COX, they backed way off and supported Me.

While you never ADMIT to anything, you always stress your PRIVACY - Nobody, but NO ONE can legally gain access to your computer - Unless you personally INVITED them."
