,Ace-s-High,2008-01-23T12:39Z,"Once again it would be highly appreciated if people would upload as well as download. The speed at the moment is ridiculous. You really don't lose much bandwidth by uploading a few kb/s while downloading. In fact, if people were not as greedy as they are, everyone would have a faster download. "

,LostDude,2008-01-24T02:11Z,"Just finished watching.

Video: 9
Audio: 5

Reason for audio rating: It's mono and has a slight hissing throughout the entire movie. You'll only notice it if you wear headphones and during silent scenes. Still, audio would be a hell of an improvement than that of the actual R5."
,dungie203,2008-01-24T18:52Z,"Sorry for the stupid question but wil this work in the UK as im confused as to what R5 means?


Will it play on uk disc?  Ill be using k-lite codec if thats ok.


Thanks."
,aMaR_,2008-01-24T21:55Z,Ooo nice!!
,jcpoker508,2008-01-25T08:21Z,Some one please help! After I DL the file and convert and burn using Winavi I try to play the dvd in my dvd player but gives me a error messages about the disc not having a play back feature. Is this because it is in a region 5 fromat? I don't have this problem any other time.
