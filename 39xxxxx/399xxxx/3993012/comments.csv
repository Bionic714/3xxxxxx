,The Soft Touch,2008-01-24T09:07Z,"FIRST up load...!!!!!!!

Could be fake?????"
,k.swiss,2008-01-24T09:12Z,No this is not a fake its the real thing i dont mess around with this crappy false uploads ;) as said in the details section enjoy 
[T],Knaster,2008-01-24T10:01Z,The Soft Touch noone said my stuff was fake when i first uploaded a few years back
,k.swiss,2008-01-24T10:16Z,"Well no worries, i understand the reason it was questioned, but no fear.
All items by myself uploaded will be real, NO fakes, NO virus, NO spam, and so on.
I dont agree with that childish stuff, nor would i waste maxing my upload when i could be gaming instead of seeding.....
"
,k.swiss,2008-01-25T22:04Z,"Correct me if im wrong  but i am using utorrent and it says.... (0)25 seeds are you telling me that says theres 25 seeds  but not 1 is helping seed ? i mean im not 100 % sure how that works but if im right what the hell surely 1 at least but if im wrong could someone enlighten me please, thanks "
,craig666z,2008-01-26T16:18Z,"I've never used a keygen before - what's it supposed to do while generating pass?
Because when I try to run it I get all kinds of warnings from Comodo Defense that it is malware behaviour - trying to access this and that.
Is this normal?"
,k.swiss,2008-01-27T06:47Z,"Well i have no idea whats used to make these work or how, but i do know i used this to generate mine and my comp is clean and clear, so i am assuming its normal  i do use avg free edition windows defender and sygate fire wall plus spybot search and destroy so my comps pretty well covered, but i do have my own serial when game was purchased i just used all i upped here to make sure it worked correctly and it did.."
,k.swiss,2008-01-27T06:51Z,Also the keygen is used to generate the serial for the games install :D 
,1stmatejohn,2008-01-28T20:27Z,"C'mon guys! There's 9 of you sitting at 100% seed and not ONE of you is D/Ling!! I'm getting a lousy 12kbs! If you're not willing to D/L, PirateBay will have to start regulating everyone. If this continues, this site dies - then you can go and pay for everything. Numbnuts! Pay it forward!"
,k.swiss,2008-01-29T00:23Z,"I really dont believe these people who hit and run. All the W's torrentstorage com has a ratio plan to prevent this, i wasnt gonna write this but seems  people need a place to go so im giving one where people seed and are willing to seed.....

,mariandru,2008-02-07T13:04Z,sorry but i can not find the cd keys. could you give it to me please?
,k.swiss,2008-02-07T21:44Z,Use the FFF Keygen to creat the keys click on generate after choosing the appropriate choice from drop down box section
,k.swiss,2008-02-08T21:57Z,"I see everybodys eager to comment. :S at least a thankyou would be nice, or maybe just rate the torrent and let others know if its good or not. well i spose they know since everybodys downloading it but still you get my point :D"
,rossgload4ever,2008-02-21T03:09Z,how do i get the medal of honor allied assult to mount w/o the cd? 
,k.swiss,2008-02-27T02:51Z,Use deamon tools  or similer to create a virtual drive and mount the iso :D
,hyung88,2008-03-13T15:07Z,"Hey this torrent is working great.  I'm downloading it at 140 kbs :D.  Appreciate the upload, I'll seed this so anyone else who downloads this torrent can get a decent speed :)."
,kevster1976,2008-03-20T23:36Z,"Seed Pleeeeeeezzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!!

,CaptainRocky0715,2008-05-19T23:24Z,hurry up seeders! only 1 out of 4 connected...:(
,CaptainRocky0715,2008-05-20T04:30Z,i have about 25% done and I have a ratio >1.5. So can I get some seeds from other now?
,CaptainRocky0715,2008-05-20T21:30Z,how to i mount everything and install stuff?
,CaptainRocky0715,2008-05-20T21:36Z,nevermind i got it working :)
,jman4000,2008-06-05T18:15Z,"Good torrent, took me about 2 hours to download. Use PowerISO or Alcohol 120; don't use Daemon it has Adware. Just follow instructions and you'll be fine. ;)"
,danostrife,2008-07-25T12:13Z,"Never had to do this before.

Having used the Dutch 1.11 patch for MOHAA, there seems to be no matching crack on the net. Using the one for other countries' editions results in the game crashing when clicking on basic training, forcing me back to the desktop.

Have also tried installing the US and UK patch, which told me neither version could be found.

Best off downloading this if you want both expansions, and have MOHAA already."
,kyril,2008-08-15T00:31Z,what the heck? i'm now installing both breakthrough and spearhead and entered the correct CD key from FFF keygen but i got this error that  _Code.exe not found and the registration number is incorrect on both of those games. can anyone help me?
,k.swiss,2008-08-19T10:30Z,"I do not understand why there are problems everything on the torrent which i uploaded ages ago shud work perfectly. this has had many downloads with many satisfied peers.

PLEASE If this is a repeated problem for others let me know i will try and resolve it some how :) untill then im suggesting theres NOTHING wrong with this download and teh problem remains with the peers 

I would say compatability issues if its crashing back ( NOT ) with patches  "
,9911553402,2008-12-05T07:01Z,"well when i try to install it it says ""Windows cannot Find Medal of Honor Allied Assault Breakthrough_code.exe make sure you typed the name correctly, and try again. To search for a file go to the Start Menu and click the Search button."" then it says ""The registration number was incorrect. Installation cannot continue""....but never got a chance to put in the cd key lol."
,Data1912,2009-02-09T09:09Z,"I was having the same issue as danostrife with MOHAA. 
Specifically the game crashing to the desktop when starting basic training. 
I have also had to use the dutch patch but you can fix this by downloading the 

MOH: Allied Assault [MULTI] No-CD/Fixed Image 

at gamecopyworld this works 100%!"
,Mesko2,2009-05-03T20:59Z,"Patches don't work and there are no craks for AA and AAB.
AAS crack works."
