,DamnBitchAssNiggers,2008-01-24T02:45Z,"Thanks Man !!! For over a year now... over a God Damn year was I waiting for the last 27 DVDs :) ... Now they're here... Thank you man... You're doing a Great Job...

Just one question... How is it that the Movie isn't here? This Island Earth... I remember having it somewhere... but I can't really remember that somewhere :) ... so enclosing it on a DVD or something would be Great :) ... Since you got all the other ones here...

Thanks again man..."
,DamnBitchAssNiggers,2008-01-24T14:07Z,"And is there a chance of you having the RiffTrax?

Or anybody else?"
,UMe2,2008-01-27T00:49Z,"@Damn: I have The Movie as a legally bought copy. It's PAL with englisch and german audio track. But since there are already some torrents out there with The Movie I won't bother sharing it.

And concerning RiffTrax: These are cheap - just 3.99$ . And since this is an ongoing project I suggest, no, I ASK everyone to support it to make sure there will be more and they continue to stay away from DRM and copy protection. MST3K is a cancelled show. The writers and producers are paid. There is no harm done if you download it, no loss. But as soon as people steal RiffTrax instead of buying it - it will be cancelled.

Let me quote Bill Corbett blog entry on RiffTrax:
""3) Please don?t pirate people?s work. Our work, that of our seafaring friends, or anyone?s for that matter. It makes it a whole lot less likely that you?ll see more work, from any of us. I know I?m mostly preaching to the converted on this site, so please excuse my moralizing. I also know there?s lot of complicated stuff to be worked out on this newfangled interweb, especially regarding ownership and copyrights. But if people can?t make a living creating stuff, it won?t hang around for long. It really is that simple.""

Btw: No 12 is up:

,yrah,2008-05-27T04:07Z,Great work as usual. Had weird nostalgia when I realized that Master Ninja was a tv show from the 80's THAT I WATCHED. My Dad made some of the same jokes about how old and fat Lee Van Cleef looks in this show.
