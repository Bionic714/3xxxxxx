,holysocks,2008-02-06T07:16Z,"It works. But some songs don't load. It hangs while loading. Burned on DVD+R DL, will try on -R later. Anyone have any other suggestions?"

,KissArmy,2008-02-09T13:38Z,"Guitar Hero guitars works just fine.
But it freezes when loading ""Go with the Flow"" with Queens of the Stone Age, read that's happening if you don't rip the dual layer disc correctly, anyone got passed that song?"

,KissArmy,2008-02-09T21:55Z,"The Toxic dual layer patch did help a bit, but then it freezes in the song ""Electric Version"" by The New Pornographers. Anyone else?"
,Spraxx8,2008-02-13T18:18Z,"i got i working fully, every song loads ^^. i use matrix infinity(with DVD-DL support). Patched the image with the Toxic app and burned it on some crappy fuji dvd+r dl, really surprised it worked :)"

Running from hdd works lika a charm."

,juudu,2008-02-21T20:15Z,"Some songs does'nt work, i bet they are from the second layer. I have matrix chip and i used verbatim dl -r disc. Anyone got this working when burned?"
,ricky4502,2008-02-29T21:32Z,so this really doesn't work with swap magic 3.6? if not i'd rather just hold off and wait till it comes out on the wii
,Gorobsessed,2008-03-02T18:25Z,When will a geek post a version of rock band with all the downloadable song of the xbox 360 and ps3 inside but for the ps2 users ??
,Ginger_Overlord,2008-03-15T23:52Z,"Had to buy a Logitech USB mic for this game as the message 'microphone not detected' always appears if you try the game without a mic plugged in.

Anyways, bought the mic, plugged it in and the same message appears again. WTF!?

What mics work with this game? will a SingStar mic work? What a waste of a disc!"
,jockeeeeee,2008-04-05T15:18Z,All usb mic's should work
,jokklas,2008-05-13T17:33Z,Singstar mic will work yes..
