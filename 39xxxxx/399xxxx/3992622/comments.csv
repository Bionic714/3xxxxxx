It is my goal to provide a comment on all the torrents I download that includes any information that the original uploader omitted and also rates the torrent on overall quality using a simple five-point scale as well as any applicable virus, ad and spy-ware warnings."
[T],EvilTSAngel,2008-02-12T05:38Z,ok so you just wanted to say that you wanted to comment on every torrent you dl?  You didn't really say much about the torrent besides the fact that your downloading it.   
[T],EvilTSAngel,2008-02-12T05:40Z,"also for wanting to add ""omitted"" info i don't see that your even uploading any torrents of your own to share out. "
