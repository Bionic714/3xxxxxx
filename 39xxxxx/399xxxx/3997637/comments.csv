I mean really. There are a lot of Mac users out there (and iPod users, I might add) that can only use the .mp3 format. If you plan to share the file, please share it in a universal format.

Once again, thanks for sharing, and please use a more universal format."

I'm a MAC user and there is a converter called All2MP3.  Very easy to use.  @wakko_hack think before you speak, if you're internet savvy at all you would have done a search for a converter (the name is listed above).  
Thanks again for the upload!"
