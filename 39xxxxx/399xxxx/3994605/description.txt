THE HIGH CHAPARRAL 3-4

 3. The Ghost of Chaparral   9/17/1967
Victoria's efforts to overcome husband John Cannon's memory of his first wife are thwarted when Apaches lay siege to their ranch, and she is kidnapped. Victoria is exchanged for an injured Apache and receives two opportunities to live in safety and leave the husband who doesn't love her. Former suitor Anthony Grey rides in with an offer to take her to England, as Indians attack in earnest. Don Sebastian, her father, arrives with armed vaqueros to break the siege and insists his daughter return to the safety of her home in Mexico.
  Guest star: Patrick Horgan (Anthony Grey, Lord Ashbury), Joaquin Martinez (Little Cloud), Carlos Rivas (Jorge)
