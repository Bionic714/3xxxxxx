,Coolshrek,2008-01-29T19:57Z,"Does this application works? After installation I get ""Can't locate resource dll for application"". Should I copy one of .dll to a system?s folder (System32 for example)?  "
,Coolshrek,2008-01-29T21:08Z,"Works. Just download the latest version of EZ(6.2.5) from here http://www.xrite.com/product_overview.aspx...&SoftwareID=625

,Coolshrek,2008-09-17T21:04Z,"Sorry, don't have it!"
,duscati,2009-03-31T08:15Z,So I've been trying for awhile now I'm having the same DLL error message and that link is down. xrite doesnt let you download trials.
