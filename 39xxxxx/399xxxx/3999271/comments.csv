,arbish,2008-02-12T03:24Z,thanks man... really needed that. uif files were really getting on my nerves. IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM
,sd9602,2008-03-06T23:44Z,Works perfect. Thanx
,Cinnstar,2008-03-29T06:27Z,"OK, I am new to this so please humor me. I downloaded a UIF file, a huge one and then tried to convert it. The screen ""flashed"" and the result was an ISO file (I have Power ISO) that had nothing on it, 0kb. Is there something else I need to do for the converter to work? The converter certainly looks straight forward enough, just plug and chug. Thanks for your help in advance."
,archangel52005,2008-04-11T03:35Z,Cinnstar- HOnestly don'y know what to tell you as I did not develop the prog. I just use it and thought I'd share I believe the developers info is in the prog. I would recommend trying to email them.
,Rampage84,2008-05-03T10:10Z,This didn't work.. could be a vista thing?!
,archangel52005,2008-05-09T03:47Z,I have Vista and it worked fine for me. I emailed the creator about some issues other users have had and I was told its most likeley an issue with the .uif file but occasionally some files don't convert.
