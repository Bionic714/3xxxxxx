I found this awhile back and thought I would share it with those who were frustrated like me with all the torrents that are in .uif format. 

Just upload the .uif in to the program and select a destionation for the new .iso file and you're done!





*Sorry it took so long just learning to do this. Please let me know if this is working or if I messed up somewhere. Thanks.
