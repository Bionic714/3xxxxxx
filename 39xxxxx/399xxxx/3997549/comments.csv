I wouldnt worry about that to much.
There is no actual law violation that has occured so it is the Anti Pirate Buroue(APB) who whines all over again.
Last time they did a razzia they ended up hated by the majority of all swedes and were prosecuted themselves for disrupting a majority of the big coprporations internet traffic.
But now it is a new governement who is pro US and the fucked up US laws so it is worse than last time but i wouldent panic about it anyway."

They are affiliated with the german ChaosComputerClub and in no way related to media industry or copyright enforcement ventures.

,darklemming,2008-02-07T07:51Z,"Whatever software you use to torrent you should know how to use it.

I use uTorrent (or do I).

Usually you have to bring up the details of the torrent, via right-click, and in the software interface somewhere you get to modify which tracker the torrent uses.

I usually remove anything that is external to the Pirate Bay.

You can tell when a torrent has external trackers when the torrent has like crazy amount of seeders. Like right now this torrent has 5000+ seeders, cool and all but Moviex is screwing you over if you don't delete their tracker.

Go to ConvertXtoDVD , add the video file, pick your movie and the program will automatically add the subtitles. You don't see the subtitle when you do this but the program will add it to the movie. for example dogtown.avi and dogtown.srt   I guess there have been more problems adding subs with the newest version. Once I started doing it right I have had no problems....good luck.."
