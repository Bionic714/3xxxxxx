              http://www.db-audioware.com/sidechaincompressor.htm      

           Side-chaining compressors are amazingly useful effects.     
           They are standard issue tools for vocal ducking in radio    
          production, to fade out music when a narrator is speaking.   
          They are also insanely popular in dance production, able to  
          make your whole mix "pump" or "breathe" by following a kick  
                                     drum.                             
                                                                       
           Unfortunately, side-chaining in software can be tricky.     
             Some audio programs simply do not support it, others      
                  require pretty complex routing techniques.           
                                                                       
          The good news is that Sidechain Compressor is easy to use,   
          and works in almost any audio software package - even those  
            that do not directly support side-chaining***.  It only    
              takes a few mouse clicks and you're up and running!      
                             Our Finest Sound Yet                      
                                                                       
           As if that wasn't enough, we have completely re-designed    
           the compression algorithm for a more analogue response.     
              This compressor offers more character, control and       
          flexibility than any previous db audioware compressor (and   
                      we've built a few over the years).               
                                                                       
            Smooth sounding compression is possible with very short    
             attack/release times.  Sidechain Compressor actually      
               performs wonderfully as a standard channel insert       
           compressor, and by tuning the EQ and Shape controls, you    
              can completely modify the response and sound of the      
                                  compressor.

                             Universal Sidechains                      
                                                                       
            At the heart of Sidechain Compressor is db audioware's     
            Universal Sidechains, the most popular and well-tested     
            independent side-chain method on the market.  Universal    
           Sidechains let you side-chain in most multi track hosts,    
          even if the host software itself does not have that native   
                                capability***.                         
                                                                       
           So when you want to do multi track side-chaining, simply    
          open two copies of Sidechain Compressor, one in your "send"  
            track and one in your "receive" track.  Set the plug-in    
            controls as shown below and your Universal Sidechain is    
                                 ready to go!                          
                                                                       
           Notice that when set up like this (External Trig is on),    
          the "send" plug-in does not compress the audio, but passes   
              audio unprocessed directly to its output.  Only the      
           "receive" plug-in acts as a compressor.  For full details   
                          please see the User Manual.                  
                                                                       
           For added flexibility, you can side-chain from one "send"   
          track to multiple "receive" tracks.  Just set up as above,   
           making sure that every "receive" plug-in is tuned to the    
                         same Universal Sidechain bus.                 
                                 MIDI Control                          
                                                                       
          If you prefer to control your plug-ins with hardware knobs   
             or sliders, Sidechain Compressor is happy to oblige.      
           Thanks to db audioware's easy-to-use MIDI Learn feature,    
          it's simple to map any on-screen control to your favourite   
                        external MIDI control surface.                 
                                                                       
           *** Universal Sidechains work with most multi-track audio   
              software (supporting VST or Audio Units) currently       
          available on PC Windows and Mac OS X.  However, you should   
            check that Universal Sidechains work correctly on your     
           system before purchasing.  Fully functional demo versions   
              of all our products are available for this purpose.      
                                                                       
          NEW!  Version 1.1.0 adds manual gain control and ability to  
         side-chain multiple receive tracks from a single send track.
