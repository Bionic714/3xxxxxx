Overview:	When Jimmy Wang Yu joined Shaw Brothers in 1963, musicals overshadowed action films; but he would soon change that. In "The Sword And The Lute", Kwei Wu (Jimmy Wang Yu) and his partner (Chin Ping) are homeward bound to destroy the "Phoenix Lute", a deadly weapon which accurately shoots poisonous needles up to 500 paces and can only be destroyed with the Kan curved sword. It's like a Western sword-and-sorcery film on drugs, featuring high-flying, frenetic faced swordplay.

I've been really sick the past week or so and I'm finally feeling well enough to post another movie. I will be responding to comments on other torrents and posting more movies ASAP.
