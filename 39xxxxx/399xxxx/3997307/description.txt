Message From Space / Uchu kara no messeji
In what probably amounts to the most blatant rip-off of Star Wars to date, Japan\'s Message from Space (Uchu kara no messeji) from 1978 features a super-fortress flyover, a white-clad princess, rogue star pilots, dogfights in space, a plucky robot, an intergalactic watering hole, a planet-killing space-station-moon, blasters, swords, armored minions, and a climactic trench-run to deliver a torpedo into an open shaft... ok, it\'s a tunnel, but the similarity is unmistakable.

Message from Space, while attempting to emulate the style of Star Wars, does vaguely attempt a unique storyline. 

King Kaiba from the peaceful planet of Jillucia has sent out eight Liabe holy seeds into space, each to find a warrior to defend from the evil Gavanas, who have nearly destroyed Jillucia. The warriors band together to overcome the \"galactic empire\" through several Star Wars-type scenarios, including sword fights, blaster exchanges, droids that save the day, and of course the obligatory \"tunnel run\".
