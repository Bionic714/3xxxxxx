,Regger,2008-05-29T16:24Z,What is the runtime. Becaus I've heard that the French DVD is cut.
,jeffmerch,2009-03-16T04:16Z,"i take it the french dvd has a slightly extended ending due to the audio switching to french in the last two minutes of the film? 

thanks for the up.

This movie in good DVD-quality (DVD5 from R2 japanese DVD + english dub audio) is:

,c3k1,2009-08-08T00:10Z,"Audio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz 6ch 192Kbps [AC-3]
Video: MPEG2 Video 704x576 (16:9) 25.00fps 9640Kbps [Video]
Quality is acceptable (but seems like it was captured from a TV screen...) Sound also a little shitty (English dubbed). Better this than nothing."
