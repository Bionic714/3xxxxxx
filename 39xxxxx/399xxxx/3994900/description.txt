INFO:

This compilation is the "lighter" side of electro industrial and spreads over
three decades (1980-2006). I call it EBM! Many nice tracks from the golden
80's and 90's that modern industrial acts are influenced. Tracks varies from 
melodic synthpop to classic postpunk electro. Definitely "POPier" than my 
other compilations but still timeless and very good music. >)
