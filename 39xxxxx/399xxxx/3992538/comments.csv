,seven0fnine,2008-10-22T01:09Z,"Negative, this torrent is very much alive and is being seeded.

I believe 'The house that screamed' to be 'La Residencia' but with English audio instead of the original Spanish audio. Can anyone confirm this?"
,Filalithis,2010-01-02T21:24Z,please seed!
,Filalithis,2010-01-04T18:51Z,dead...
,phasmatrope,2010-05-10T01:27Z,"Been trying to get this for the last few weeks, can someone please seed?? (or list another site that has the rest?? Stuck at 82.49%...) Thanks!!"
,Mystikal_Smoker,2010-06-11T13:27Z,Also stuck at 82.4%.......
,PaliGreg,2010-06-25T22:31Z,"No seeders. Can someone please seed, I will seed back as always. This is the only torrent I can find for this movie."
,PaliGreg,2010-06-26T22:46Z,"Got it, thanks for seeding."
,PaliGreg,2010-06-26T23:37Z,"I was wrong, it is still at 82.4%. Video will play with some freezing, missing pieces I believe. This confused me, thought it would not play at all if not completed. Please seed. So close yet so far."
,PaliGreg,2010-07-01T03:38Z,This torrent is dead! Do not waste your time. You will quickly get to 82.4 because that is what all the peers have. Even tried the forums to no avail.
