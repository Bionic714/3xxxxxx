,RastaMahn,2008-01-31T10:33Z,"I ordered the extended version on DVD yesterday. =)
But, i'll dl anyway, let's see which comes first! Besides, good movies should be seeded for everyone to enjoy."
,texasfireball,2008-02-02T04:37Z,"Very, very good copy. Great video quality plus 5.1 sound. Use DivX to DVD to bring it out.
Really enjoying this.
Thanks."
,mj50273,2008-03-29T16:08Z,"Folks, PLEASE SEED this torrent.  My upload is faster than my download!  Sheesh!"
,Black_Nocturne,2008-04-10T08:47Z,"The Quality is Excelent for both sound and video.

However, the extended version of the David Lynch movie is (if you will pardon my bluntness) Frakking Retarded! I loved and very much preffer the original release version of this film. The changes made in the extended version make it unwatchable for me. Slow, slow, slow, spelling out every detail as though the audience had not even a whisper of intelligence.

Someone please seed the original cut of this film."
,taconway,2008-05-06T06:14Z,i downloaded this twice - it seems like the last ten minutes of the movie is missing - is anyone else having this problem???

,dirgebringer,2008-11-19T13:55Z,"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS. who the fuck added stupid cartoons to the movie?? and then cut out the original introduction? it looks like some amateur fanflick, where some retard butchered lynch's movie and added clips from other movies to it. i made it 10 minutes into this and then turned it off. THIS IS BULLSHIT. "
,Draethos,2008-12-02T22:28Z,"Remove the god damn david lynch tag, it is a brutal attack on his version, which in my humble opinion is the greatest. But that is besides the point. Elguaxo you have added the tag David Lynch and this movie clearly isnt his version!!!
For those looking for his version heres the link http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4371069/Dune_(1984)_(Kyle_MacLachlan__Jose_Ferrer)"
,Draethos,2008-12-02T22:31Z,Oh and mor*n your link to IMDB is to the original. Stop f*cking with ppl!
,seamusmcfadden,2009-01-12T01:29Z,"This torrent is junk, do not waste your time."

,pirateapproved,2009-06-09T19:19Z,"From Wikipedia-
Alan Smithee version

The 189-minute ""Alan Smithee"" version was released in 1989. Prepared originally for syndicated television by Universal's MCA division (and later seen on basic cable television networks) for a two-night broadcast, it was prepared without either participation or authorization by David Lynch. It includes a new narrator and a new prologue with a montage of painted pictures. It also reinserts approximately 40 minutes of cut footage, extending some existing scenes and adding others that were, until this version, entirely unseen. This television version also includes some repeated shots throughout the film.

Lynch objected to this version and petitioned the Director's Guild of America to have his name removed from the credits (which were replaced by the pseudonyms Alan Smithee and Judas Booth). This version was initially only released on laserdisc in Japan, but was also found as a poorly recorded VHS on the bootleg market.[24] It is now available worldwide on DVD as the ""Extended Edition,"" but 13 minutes shorter because it was originally presented on television in two parts, with the opening and closing credits repeated on the second night with a Part 1 recap. Only Universal's Region 1 release from 2006 presents the Smithee version of Dune in the film's original widescreen 2.35:1 aspect ratio.

,Dathaurate,2009-06-13T02:24Z,"This is not Dune!  David Lynch did not direct this.  Watching this movie will ruin Dune for you forever.  Don't do it.

Won't somebody please think of the children?  This could ruin Dune for an entire generation.  Please destroy this."
,azzadawg,2009-06-17T12:20Z,First comment here and I have to agree with the naysayers. This version is rubbish! The only reason I want to d/l this movie is to find the original. Guess I'll skip this one!
,dubdrone,2009-06-17T22:36Z,"Will you please look at the name of the torrent?!? It CLEARLY says 'EXTENDED', RIGHT AT THE TOP!? I don't know what's wrong with you morons, why can't you just read it and see that it's not the original 1984 version?? Why does EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU have to post the EXACT SAME message about how cool you are for not liking an extended versions?? NOBODY CARES! Next time, read before you start downloading and coming on here and yelling at everyone for your own stupidity. Do you need someone to come wipe your ass too?? Grow up, you idiots!"
,MaidenOutOfHell,2009-08-17T13:35Z,"overall excellent quality, and the extended scenes just add to the symbolic atmosphere of this movie. like it very much.
but i´ve noticed a scene missing - when barone harkonnen is killing one of his minions by unplugging the 'heart-plug' - you just see him flying blood-oozing... well i don´t know maybe more is cut-out as it´s years ago i´ve seen the other version(s).
again thankx man"
,Moroko76,2009-12-08T06:26Z,"Been looking all over the place. I eventualy going to buy a legit version of it.  But in the meantime im going to enjoy this one.

The quality is great and the sound is amazing. 

Thanks for the seed. Il keep seeding for a while!"
,naughtygirl,2010-02-15T13:25Z,"I'd like to buy a copy of the ""2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen Extended Version (177mins)"", but being in the arse end of the world, there aren't any to buy.
"
,Chrybdis,2010-07-01T04:07Z,"Haven't seen this but heard it was terrible...
Personally I recommend not this hack extended tv version [177 min] but the Special Edition [190 min] which I HAVE seen and have to say is way superior to the original.  It expands nicely on the original movie, which always seemed over-cut and rushed for time in a way that made it confusing to anyone who had never read the book as well as frustrating to those who had read the book because so much was left out."
,couchtomarto,2010-08-25T19:51Z,"This is the TELEVISION cut.  Don't do this to yourself.
Deleted: disturbing content in the baron intro (stills of mutilated faces; doctor tending to baron's pimples; the sacrificial boy).
Added: clumsy redundant dialog; background music in place of dramatic silence.
Changed: sparing female voice-over to talkative male voice-over.
With the flow and atmosphere of the theatrical cut pretty much ruined, this lame television cut is a shame."
,couchtomarto,2010-08-26T12:30Z,"things left out in the tv cut:
irulan intro
secret report within the guild
paul's vision of chani in mohiam's room
stills of stitched ears and eyes
pus flowing into flask
doctor loving baron's pimples
rabban drinking squeezed insect
baron's sacrificial boy
jessica's ""i'll miss caladan so much""
baron spitting on jessica's face
washing away of meat remnants"
,yo9mama6,2010-11-06T01:04Z,I love this movie! Thank you!
,mohiergauth,2011-01-29T15:55Z,"Hating to agree with trolls. But yeah this version is extremely lacking, it's like a fucking Disney movie or something."
,bragazar1710,2011-07-16T14:10Z,thanks.
,imuaokalani,2012-05-03T22:51Z,Finally found it....this was what I was looking for. Pay no attention to the people that are bitching. This was the EXTENDED version of David Lynch's movie and no.....they did not acquire or need his permission to come out with the extended version and needed to be done fast. I can live with the drawn painted rendering as someone called cartoons (moron). I simply love the extended scenes like Gurney playing his instrument. thank you THANK YOU!!!! 
,imuaokalani,2012-05-04T03:14Z,"Again I have to comment that this was what I was looking for and cannot thank you enough......how can the others here be bitching about this or that....so what....David Lynch kindly asked his name be taken from the credits and what happened was his credit was put under another name....just the quote from Gurney ""Behold....as a wild ass in the desert do I go forth to my work"" is reason enough to download LOL.......again thank you.....and YES NOW I HAVE BOTH VERSIONS...AWESOME!!!!!"
,Shtyro,2012-07-20T13:46Z,You guys need to do some research. I'm not sure about the extended cut but I know the original cut had nothing to do with Lynch. He did not have final cut of this movie and he hated the final cut. He completely renounced and refused to talk about it in interviews he felt they had ruined his movie. From what I've read when approached to do a directors cut he was so pissed he declined and truly wants nothing to do with this movie. The extended cut is probably closer to his original vision than the original although I can't say for sure. But stop saying the original was Lynch's because honestly neither of these cuts probably had anything to with him.
