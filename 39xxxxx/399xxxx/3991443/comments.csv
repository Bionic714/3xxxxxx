,StayPlation,2008-01-23T19:16Z,We're all stuck at 56.3 %... 
,crimson4649,2008-01-24T00:19Z,"cant get it to work, and im using the latest .netframeworsk (3.5)

when dubbleclicking the audiosurfboard i just get promted with a window telling me the app couldent start.

Any sugestions?"
,Vomiter,2008-01-25T08:16Z,"Bizurkur, you make it sound like you didnt see this coming."
,Kool2bchilln,2008-01-25T22:32Z,"Bizurker:

 This is a free beta, it's been that way and you can still actually download it from audio-surf.com with the right DL link.

StayPlation:

 There are 17 seeds, check your client because they all obviously reached 100%

Crimson:

 This was meant for XP or Vista, if you are running mac, you're probably screwed.
If you're running windows, then all i can say is you have something set wrong because it does work with the lesser version of .NET Framework."
,StratubasGR,2008-01-30T22:13Z,"works perfectly.... just....
I don't think receiving and uploading highscores would mess with the unlimited custom songs feature. It's a pity it's disabled."
,Kool2bchilln,2008-01-30T22:49Z,well you have to redirect to the local server so it doesn't figure out from the real server that it's an outdated version AND that it's not /allowed/ to work.
,Zeke129,2008-02-12T06:20Z,"bizurkur: Nobody really hates the pirate scene, especially when the ""pirate scene"" is downloading something that is free. 

Like this game, for example! You'd think people playing the FREE beta would be a good thing..."
,Sanicle,2008-02-12T13:44Z,"Bizurkur - I enjoy this game, in fact I've pre ordered the final Steam version. I'm simply here looking for a way to continue playing my own tracks until the final version's released. Also, as stated by several others already, this is the free beta version, no loss to anyone.
Regards,
-=Sanicle=-"
,dsiceman,2008-02-13T10:00Z,Saw the announcement on Steam so I came here to check it out.  LOVED IT.  It's pre-ordered. :D
,bachterman,2008-02-13T16:15Z,"bizurkur: don't worry, this will be the program that i will pay for it. it definietly deserves every cent. :)"
,DetoxFox,2008-02-16T05:49Z,"Bizurkur:

I definitely just bought this on steam. :D

I loved the beta, I felt the need to buy the entire thing. I'm just here to see if there's a portable version for school playing ;3"
,MossadUK,2008-02-18T16:13Z,"Maybe Bizurkur is some wannabe talking shit....!

If you are genuine then let me say that Speedball2 released on Steam was a pile of shit.  The original Bitmap Brothers version was much better."
,fuzzyyarbles,2008-02-18T21:48Z,"i downloaded the game and played through the tutorial. now, i can't play any of my own songs. every time i try to play one, the default song ""wasp"" - by bauhaus starts playing. any ideas on how to fix that?"
,Mr_Wendle,2008-02-19T03:29Z,"This is a good original game. It was developed not by a corporation but by a single independent developer. He has priced it at a reasonable $10 US.

If you support independent game developers, you can try the free demo or buy the game at http://www.audio-surf.com/ The $10 investment allows you to enjoy all aspects of this innovative game. "
,Bizurkur,2008-02-19T22:26Z,"when I say ""helped make"" what I really meant to say was ""Am good buddies with the developer and told them how crappy some ideas were.""
Example: The ship used to not change color shape or size. My idea :D"
,Spraxx8,2008-02-20T19:30Z,"whoa, nice crack. hate the fiddler crap...
:)"
,Kool2bchilln,2008-02-24T22:51Z,"-Mr_Wendle
I bought it myself :) $10 was a great price for this.
Just because this is a ""pirate"" thing to do, doesn't always mean the point of it is specifically to screw someone over.
This is a hobbled version anyway."
,Kool2bchilln,2008-02-24T22:54Z,"With this, you simply don't have to install steam."
,Sk8shit,2008-03-06T19:17Z,"what program do i open this whit?> i used to use vlc  media player cuz i downloaded videos, my other downloaded games are ok, but this just wont open, any help what program to use?"
,danieldanni,2008-03-23T18:11Z,i love this game!!!!!yay!!!!!(im a litlle fuckt upp in the head)
,az1n,2008-04-01T03:17Z,"I played the demo of this, and after I was out of credits, I said to myself ""hmm, but it? I should look this up and torrent it!""."
,eyes08,2009-07-07T17:08Z,SEEEEED!!!
