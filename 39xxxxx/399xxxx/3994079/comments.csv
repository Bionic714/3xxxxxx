,armandg,2008-02-29T21:00Z,I would really appreciate seeding: 74% and waiting for more =(
,Miiilmusen,2008-03-03T21:48Z,Could someone please seed this? I'm stuck at 83.1%
,Raothi,2008-03-04T01:09Z,"By the time this finishes, Season 2 will be on DVD and Season 3 will be playing..."
,Vedgie,2008-03-07T00:47Z,"I'm stuck on 84,9 %. Can someone just seed for a couple more hours and will take over? I'm totally seriously you guys."
,Raothi,2008-03-07T14:00Z,I've been seeding/downloading for a month and still not done. This is BS...
,armandg,2008-03-09T11:24Z,"last time I wrote was feb 29th. I had 74%. Today I have 85.31%.
Uploader has got to feel a little guilty for not doing a good enough job about this..."
,pellinor61,2008-03-21T15:10Z,"Why is everyone asking for people to seed?  There is only one seeder.  He hasn't finished uploading the files yet.  We are all depending on one person to finish this.

To the uploader.  I can't help but notice that Azureus shows there has been one seeder for the last two days, but still no new data has been added to the availability.  Are you actually uploading this?"
,Raothi,2008-03-23T19:21Z,It would just be nice to have this whole thing uploaded so that the rest of us can take over and seed...
,Raothi,2008-03-23T23:21Z,OMG 4 Seeders!? PRAISE JEBUS!!!
