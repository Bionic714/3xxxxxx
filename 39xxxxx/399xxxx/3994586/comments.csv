Why did you just not check this piece of software out on the web?   And it is a whole lot better than any of your uploads...'cause you don't have any.   Note the statistics: 14 seeders and not one complaint.   What does that tell you?   Sorry, forgot...you're American.   Is it nice in the Ivy League 'cause Daddy paid your fees?   Or did your Daddy give the Dean a really good blow-job."

on topic great upload thanks."
[V],nightissuchproximity,2008-04-14T07:38Z,"Thanks, DeathsBane.   My comment was aimed at that particular person.   Did not intend to disrespect all of my American friends for whom I have great regards.  But there's always one asshole.   And now we all know who that asshole is.   Glad you are enjoying the up.   Regards."
,deezee4,2008-04-20T20:50Z,Works like a charm... thanks!

,bytehog,2008-06-02T18:58Z,"OK.  The crack seems to work.

Really, should try CloneDVD2.  Much better IMO.

This software really sucks, I found it difficult to understand and never really got it to work.  Non-inutituve GUI.  Still needs anydvd to work.

Don't bother to download.  Get CloneDVD2."
[V],nightissuchproximity,2008-06-03T14:53Z,"Sorry, bytehog, that you don't like this.   There are some that do.   But I have to agree with you that CloneDVD2 is excellent.   Only snag is that there are some out there that find CloneDVD2 difficult to use.   And good observation, everyone should have a copy of AnyDVD.   Regards."
[V],nightissuchproximity,2008-06-09T16:33Z,"Thank you.   I read a great comment from someone earlier: ""New does not always mean better"".   Cheers, db_autotek.   Regards.   "
