,flexy135,2008-01-28T14:08Z,"hi, me again, i asked a few days ago about more info, on all the changes. 
I've seen the new lots of 500 each, and just wondering, if i download these, would they already have the correct changes made, or would i still need to make the changes?

Many thanks

p.s. you rock"
,flexy135,2008-01-28T14:10Z,"my bad, just read the description properly, and see that you have made all the changes."
,kerasmus,2008-01-28T17:05Z,"HI Joda. thanks again. What program can I use to manage all of those roms? I tried offline list, but non of the roms where reconized?. I like the interface in offlinelist. Sort on region/language, and the ingame pictures. Thanks Keras"

,pether,2008-01-29T02:40Z,"Would be nice to have seperate folders for te EU/JP/US games. 8-10gb is a lot to download, and who wants to look trough all those for duplicates/triple/quartlets?"
[T],magumagu,2008-01-29T07:10Z,"You don't have to download all if you don't want to. Use uTorrent, and from the prompt when opening the torrent-file, select only the ones you want. (As I've said in my .txt-files since the stone age; RTFM!!!)

If you can't bother going through the list _once_ and select those you want, say depending on whether it's a rel from EU, JP or US, you shouldn't download this. Go buy the games already ...

It'd be a real pain in the ass fixing up different packs for everyones different perversions. Like this, it includes all roms in a tidily maner, and it's up to you to decide what ever crap you want.

Also, it would be more bothersome to find a particular numbered rom if it's split up into different folders; and most importantly, it looks frickin' ugly ...

In my opinion, you should still get all and seed though. It's the least you can do for getting all of these without any work from your part!

,ikakashi,2008-02-04T18:39Z,"I'm sorry, but I'm looking for these two roms, Nazotte Oboeru Otona no Kanji Renshuu Kanzenhan and Kageyama Method: Tadashii Kanji Kakitori-Kun - Kondo wa Kanken Taidaku Dayo and I can't find them anywhere, they were released in November. Maybe you can help Joda?"
[T],magumagu,2008-02-05T21:02Z,"Would that be:
0796  	Nazotte Oboeru Otona no Kanji Renshuu
0980  	Kageyama Method - Dennou Hanpuku - Tadashii Kanji Kaki to Rikun

Those are found in http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3996760/Joda_rompack_for_the_Nintendo_DS_[0501-1000]

,ikakashi,2008-02-06T05:32Z,"no, unfortunately i saw those, but they are both the older versions, the two that mentioned; 

Nazotte Oboeru Otona no Kanji Renshuu Kanzenhan (November 21, 2007)

Kageyama Method: Tadashii Kanji Kakitori-Kun - Kondo wa Kanken Taidaku Dayo (Release Date: November 28, 2007)

are their sequels. I guess they haven't been released yet? "
[T],magumagu,2008-02-06T20:00Z,"Sorry, didn't read well enough. Regards to Kanji-games do i only find:
 1825  	Zaidan Houjin Nippon Kanji Nouryoku Kentei Kyoukai Koushiki Soft - 250-Mannin no KanKen
 1890  	Yomesou de Yomenai Kanji DS
 1933  	Kageyama Method - Masu x Masu Pure Hyaku Masu Keisan - Hyaku Masu no Maeni Kore Dayo!

Other than that haven't been released to the scene yet as far as I know. Check on http://www.advanscene.com/ to be sure. Ore mo hontou ni yattemitai desu!

As soon as the last 10 roms get out and we reach 2000 you'll all have another pack to chew on."

,digitalpulse,2008-04-01T10:54Z,"Excellent torrent.  Clean, sorted, a lot of time and effort has been put into all the Joda packs.  Just needs continued effort from the rest of the community to keep seeding it."
