As it is very frustrating to get Dark Omen to run in any NT based Windows I made an image for Virtual PC where it is all preconfigured runs in full screen from the moment you open the image.

Virtual PC 2007 is included in this torrent, but if you already have it installed you can skip it to save 30MB on the download.

The game should work in Multiplayer, but I haven\'t tested it.

Decompressed the image is 600MB
