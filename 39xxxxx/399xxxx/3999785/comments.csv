,giggedyguy,2008-05-21T01:49Z,And once you enter a wrong serial number it will NEVER let you correct it! I cleaned the registry out and STILL can't enter a new serial number. No wonder no one uploads this program.
,giggedyguy,2008-05-21T01:56Z,"Correction. I used Tuneup Utilities to search the registry and it wasn't thorough enough. Run regular regedit and you'll find ever bit. New serial worked, but won't publish here because that's how they are flagging us!"
