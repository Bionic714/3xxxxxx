,TheFirstMan,2008-02-10T11:36Z,Could you also upload this as a DivX or XviD DVDRip? Thank you very much!

Perhaps you'll some day upload this as a rip. It is really very easy, you just have to leave your system on overnight...
Thanks for sharing..."

The new Intel processors (well, much better with MacPro etc) take less than two hours to rip something this long...please consider a rip. This movie probably deserves nothing more than a 700MB rip..."
