Huxley explores both the liberating and limiting aspects of language in our lives and how language can determine our world views. He talks of the frustration artists and mystics find in using words to express experience, and how we communicate the incommunicable. (Titled Language in 1959) - 1961 Cambridge - One Audiotape
