,Noodlehorn,2008-03-13T13:06Z,OH MY GOD!! I have been looking for this Sidney Lumet masterpiece for ages. Thanks pieprzu26!! P.S. I see you have uploaded Network as well. Another Sidney Lumet classic!! You have good taste.
,Noodlehorn,2008-03-24T13:50Z,Can somebody help please? I'm trying to play The Hill which I've downloaded from TPB. There is pic but no sound on any player. In Nero ShowTime it says I need this Plug-In. I have downloaded it and opened it. I've clicked the install button but nothing much happens. Where do I enter the serial no.? NeroShowTime still has no sound. I have Nero OEM installed. 
,Noodlehorn,2008-03-25T13:51Z,Forget Nero. Forget downloading plug-in's and all that bollocks. I've just downloaded and installed VLC Media Player for free and it plays this now WITH SOUND!! Easy!

please upload all sidney lumet films,guy's a genius!"
,tzuhalem,2008-12-06T03:43Z,"Could you change the title to ""The Hill Sean Connery Sidney Lumet""? Searching on The Hill brings up a zillion movies with Hill in their names, so this one is hard to find."
,tm875,2008-12-11T08:44Z,Please seed - stuck at 92.3%. Thanks
,dX4_GothmoG,2009-02-06T07:50Z,"can anyone please seed? i've been downloading this for a month or something, and soon i'll be stuck at 99.7%

a month, and i'm not on 99.7% even. it'll take like 6 more days with this speed to reach it..."
,Southmike,2009-02-09T08:15Z,"Thanks so much for that great film !

But please reseed, locked at 99,7%?"
,dielaughing,2011-07-30T04:25Z,"a 3 year old torrent, dead as a door nail.. a little known movie with the young Sean Connery.. I doubt if I'll ever find this. If nobody has %100 then what is the point of downloading the incomplete percentage that the few hopeful are hanging onto? NA..I'm outta here... a title change would do this torrent a great deal of service.. if the upper or someone would just include Sir Sean."
