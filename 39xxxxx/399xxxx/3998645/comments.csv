,macwel99,2008-01-28T00:29Z,This torrent dosen't work for me. I can't load the image. I got a checksum error. But I don't know if the download was brooken.
,macwel99,2008-01-28T01:29Z,"It's definitiv not working, that img file. I download a sec. Time. Same Error. Is not me first Torrent Download at all. So I know what I doing. Don't spend Money to download that."
,ph00x,2008-01-28T06:20Z,"Yeah, sorry LadyBird, and everyone else, but the checksum doesn't match.

This means that you *can't mount the disk image*, so don't bother downloading this. Repairing it doesn't help, by the way.

LadyBird, maybe you'd consider remaking a new DMG (not just a new torrent)?"
,Ladybird127,2008-01-28T18:56Z,"funny, I just test my dmg. working well... anyway I will remake a new dmg and torrent later. sorry about this"
,Ladybird127,2008-01-28T19:49Z,"the new dmg is posted, hope it work..."
,imacalu,2008-01-29T01:22Z,"just skip the checksum by clicking on 'skip'. Or open   disc-utility's preferences and uncheck there. Worked for me, but another error came up while installing filemaker: ""error while decompressing 'AdobeMyungjoStd-Medium-Acro.otf""..."
,simoartsimo,2008-02-05T08:02Z,"Thank you so much Ladybird127, nice upload and it works fine with my G5. "
,simoartsimo,2008-02-05T08:10Z,"Sorry Ladybird127, I thought I'm in the page of the torrent posted in 28..01.08 !! I shifted my comment to the other page. Anyway, here or there THANK YOU So MUCH."
