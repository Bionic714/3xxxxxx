Cross Of Iron Dvdrip 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074695/





The film opens with a squad of seasoned German soldiers, led by a disillusioned but skilled corporal, on a patrol on the Russian front in WWII. They return to base to find a new commander, a traditional Prussian officer who wants only one thing from his command - An Iron Cross to maintain his family honor. The scene is set for a graphic portrayal of the horrors of war and of the conflict between two men of differing backgrounds.
