The german perspective is interesting."
,Raubhautz,2010-03-27T03:06Z,"There is no doubt that this is one of the finest war movies ever. Because the 'hero' in the film is not a GI, the film got less notice than it deserved."

,Raubhautz,2010-05-07T20:44Z,"Well, I cannot beleive it. This has been one of my favorite movies of all times, having owned a vhs and dvd since they have been available. I have only met 2 other people who even knew this movie existed, and both loved it. I dl this avi, left it on the seed, and in only a month, I have a ratio of over 35!!! Everytime I check my torrent, someone is dl this file! That is good news!"
