,RobrPatty,2008-01-28T03:06Z,Is this the actual RTM or is it the refresh 2?
,ASCastanza,2008-01-28T03:54Z,"I don't see how it could possibly be RTM, seeing as SP1 hasn't gone RTM yet, AND this is build 6001.18000 (which is Refresh 2) AND it was not released in standalone packages, ONLY as the Windows Update Code."
,RobrPatty,2008-01-28T06:12Z,So what is this ASCastanza? It's not fake cos I've downloaded and installed. I have a sneaking suspicion it's RC1 refresh2 in a standalone.
,EmVoVa,2008-01-28T08:56Z,"This is real RTM, not FAKE!"
,RobrPatty,2008-01-28T09:24Z,How can you tell EmVoVa?
,RobrPatty,2008-01-28T09:33Z,"What's got me bugged is this version is 6.0.6001.17028

Where as SP1 RC Refresh2 version is
6.0.6001.18000

And the SP1 RC Refresh version is
6.0.6001.17128

This has to be an older SP1"
,RobrPatty,2008-01-28T09:39Z,"Just found what this is 
6.0.6001.17028 is SP1 RC1. Came out just before
the first refresh.
He threw in the Longhorn rtm to throw us off. Thanks Pal"
,EmVoVa,2008-01-28T11:29Z,"Windows6.0-KB936330-X86.exe -x
spinstal.exe have version Build 6001.18000 (longhorn rtm.080118-1840)"
,bmj2001,2008-01-29T04:45Z,"It's the real deal.
They RTM'd it, released to manufacturing.
The actual release is not until march.
Mine says Service Pack 1.
Vista Home Premuim X86."
,Zanarkand,2008-01-30T22:29Z,"Please can someone upload this sp1 version but with 36 languages? I'm using a Hungarian Vista. I see there's an x64 build of the 36 L installer, but no x86. Hasn't it come out yet?"
,breathemetal,2008-02-01T02:48Z,"this isnt final. the final RTM will be relz feb 4th. ms said so themselves.

so if u want the final just wait a few more days :)"
[T],kenoneu,2008-02-05T02:53Z,"this is an OLD version (17028), not the final."
,steve1969,2008-02-05T09:43Z,"worked perfect with a fresh install of vista ultimate, than installed the sp1 , when went to updates it was fully up today"
,KeijoPertti,2008-02-05T17:59Z,This is 6.0.6001.17028 which is OLDER THAN RC1.
