,gelalia,2008-01-25T13:20Z,"Very bad DVD. Sound is fine, but video is terrible. Picture is dull. There is great lack of sharpness. Waist of time for download. Mr. tamp, make a DVD 9, and we will be all happy to download great stuff."
,tamp,2008-01-25T19:49Z,Sorry gelalia. I use CloneDVD2 and it only provide you with DVD 5. Please let me know the best way to clone a Retail-DVD. Thanks.
,060684,2008-01-26T10:17Z,"I thought the picture quality was fine enough, it didn't ruin the pleasure of watching the movie for my own part =)

But to get the best DVD9 to DVD5 convertion quality, you ought to use DVD Rebuilder and reencode with Cinema Craft Encoder, since it is  the best mpeg2 (""raw"" dvd content) encoder out there, and the quality is waaaay better than a transcode, which is what clonedvd, dvdshrink and the like does. 
Different versions here

Guides can be found on afterdawn and doom9

Hope that helps =)"

*True Lies in a nordic version since it's impossible to find.

*The Hustler. The ultimate poolshark movie, but it's impossible to find a dvdrip of it, let alone hope to find a nordic version :(

*American History X. Same here, no nordic out there, no proper quality or uncensored either
*American Psycho
*Commando
*Armageddon
*Three Kings.
*The Thin Red Line. 
*Ghost Busters.
*Toy Story. 
*Bridge over the river Kwai.
*The Great Escape

Thanks :P"

,tamp,2008-02-15T20:03Z,"This one i used CLONEDVD that compress the files to be burned as a DVD at 4.34gb. Poor quality! Please try this one as i used  DVDFab Platinum, ""DVD9"". Hope you like this better!?

,Coldylox,2008-02-29T06:49Z,"The problem with this release is it includes both theatrical and special edition versions, and the video is letterboxed widescreen, meaning there is black bars on top and bottom of the video so when you full screen it it has black space on the bottom, top, left, and right of the screen. That makes the resolution really low, and poor quality because of both movie versions included."
