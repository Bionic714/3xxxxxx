,DjDareDevil,2008-07-05T22:01Z,What could you achieve with this therapie?
,FPyro,2008-07-22T16:01Z,"I hope you are not serious?=! 
You just could achieve anything you want like losing lots of weight - Some say they lost TONS, yeah, can you imagine that? 
Others reporte they suddely stopped smoking after listening only once to disk 5..and so on...if you believe in it, you will have success certainly!"
,snowcat24,2008-09-12T10:08Z,"Yeah, I wanna confirm my sleep has been getting better. I only listened twice! Remember you're supposed to listen for about 20-30 days - the subconscious mind learns by repetition. The messages in all cd sets are positive, powerful, and not cheesy. And yes, I am the analytical, left-brain, skeptical man."
