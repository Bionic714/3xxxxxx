after burning the image file to dvd i could not follow the install instructions
can you
 
1. Install Autodesk's application with Network License Type
   
2. Create "c:\flexlm" folder and copy "adesk.dat" there

3. Change "this_host" in "adesk.dat" to your PC host name
   and path to adskflex.exe

4. Run "lmtools.exe" from Autodesk network license support,
   check/create and run the service

5. Check/create environment variable ADSKFLEX_LICENSE_FILE:

   Click right mouse button on "My Computer" and choose
   "Properties". Go to "Advanced" tab and press "Environment
   variables". Press "New" in system variables, enter variable name:

   ADSKFLEX_LICENSE_FILE

   and variable value:

   c:\flexlm\adesk.dat

   Press "OK", "OK", "OK" and reboot

   Note: if ADSKFLEX_LICENSE_FILE exists in system variables already
   (when you're opened menu) then just check/correct variable value
   throw "Edit"

6. Copy "acad2008.exe" to product's folder and use it for start
   the application each time

7. Don't forget to reboot PC, and use serial 666-66666666
   for register application "About" -> "Product information..."
   "Update..." -> menu if needed

PS: If any problem will be exists, overwrite "licpath.lic" to
    product's folder


post back if you get it working
