,Not.SlyPee,2008-02-08T19:28Z,"Works till you press 'run game' you've created button, needs some serious sorting."
,Trashcanman02,2008-02-12T05:04Z,The only version without the trojan. It's so tragic that it doesn't work.
,Slappywag,2008-02-12T10:07Z,"Works fine, just install and copy the two loader files into the Game Maker folder as is said in the Instructions, i scanned with Norton (even tho norton fails) and had no virus results or anything dangerous, thanks for the Upload Mhv3."
,jayblaze12,2008-02-16T04:01Z,"This one doesnt work. Keeps sending error messages like ""not from original maker""."
,XenOtai,2008-02-16T16:12Z,if you try the examples included it gives the error that some functions are available only in pro version
,chr1974,2008-02-20T14:13Z,"Works like a charm, no virus/trojan or other. just copy the files in loader folder into game maker install folder, edit the game maker desktop shortcut to point to the loader. Thanks for the upload man :))) "

,UltimaGreenBeast,2008-10-23T01:21Z,"@james200: that torrent is malicious, there's a trojan in it. Anyone here that downloaded it and used it without problems?"
,EricPires9,2008-12-09T17:30Z,"OMG YOU ARE THE MAN!!! I was looking for weeks on the Internet for a The Sims crack and a Game Maker 7.0 PRO crack. All of them were virus, trojans etc. But suddenly, I found you, and you had BOTH!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! :D"

,lildaniel3,2009-06-14T16:45Z,"I need help! it was downloading perfectly, but then it took a crap at 98.9% Can someone please seed if they have 100.00%? Thanks!"
,Champio30,2009-11-09T00:04Z,"when I try this, it says ""access is denied"" :("
,nima2007,2009-11-19T06:17Z,when you use a pro feature and run it does not let you and it goes to lite
,BabelonKing,2009-11-25T03:33Z,"The program works fine. Just follow the instructions carefully. When you finish with the instructions, just press the IRisLoader .exe twice. It should work then. Unfortunately, I'm using this on XPSP3. I don't know if it'll work with anything else. Maybe if the uploader gave more detailed instructions on OS compatibility? Happy Game Making."
,iiiratep,2009-12-08T04:05Z,"Epic fail.

The loader works fine if you adjust the date in the INI file as the readme says, but GM7 isn't registered when it opens. You still get the same errors when you try to use Pro features.

So this is essentially just a less convenient way of opening the same unregistered version of game maker. Good effort though."
,breon,2009-12-09T04:00Z,"Wow, who in their right mind would pirate Gamemaker anyway. It's ONLY 25 dollars. Most people spend more than that on a weekly basis on worthless trinkets and shit they never use. If people are that cheap that they can't fork out a MEASLY 25 bucks, there is no hope for mankind at all. It's not like we are talking about horribly overpriced software like Photoshop here"
,colacocabmaster,2010-08-19T09:09Z,"Works fine on XP. those who dont get it running, are noobs"
,Spoork.bz,2011-01-13T18:48Z,"""Wow, who in their right mind would pirate Gamemaker anyway?""

Those who bought it, had it revert to the lite version, and had softwrap (DRM company) never fix the problem. :)"
,zyzy92,2011-06-17T11:31Z,come the fuck on? ONLY 1 SEED!?!?!?!?
,JOL3110,2011-09-25T20:12Z,"Simple setup guys, download torrent, move all the files in the ""CRACK"" folder to your \Game Maker 7\ Folder, run ""IRiSloader.exe"", if gmaker doesn't load or whatever, open ""~datefaker.ini"" in notepad, change the first date to something in the future (I used 01-03-9001), run ""IRiSloader.exe"" again and it should work."
,JOL3110,2011-09-25T21:15Z,"False alarm, Game maker 7 reverts to lite when you try to run or save a file. DO NOT SEED"
