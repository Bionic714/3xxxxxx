The Haikuware.com (http://www.haikuware.com) Weekly SuperPack is a preconfigured VMware image of the Haiku Operating System with a whole host of software installed on it for testing. 

Haiku OS (http://haiku-os.org) is inspired by BeOS and is intended to be 100% compatible with BeOS when R1 is released. 

***Installation***

All you need to run this are the included files and a VMware product. You can get VMware Player or Server for free from http://vmware.com. 

The apps.7z is the compressed vmware disk in 7-zip format. The haiku.vmx file is the vmware configuration file. Make sure both are in the same directory and double click the haiku.vmx file to run it.


***More Info From Haikuware.com***

This is a 10gb expanding VMWare disk image. I plan to update the operating system on the image weekly so you can gauge Haiku\'s improvements. Bundled with known compatible software, it\'s the perfect way to test out Haiku\'s capabilities!

It contains the Haiku OS (rev23625) vmware graphics, network and sound drivers, all the needed libraries, developer tools, all the menu links for the included applications, desktop background, etc.

There\'s about 9.7 gb free space on it, it\'s bootable, it\'s maximally compressed to a file size of <100mb (decompresses to ~400-450mb) and should be ready to go. Please use 7zip (included in Haiku) to decompress the image.

Here\'s a VMX file in case you need it. Use that file and the disk image and try it with VMWare Player (drop the disk image and vmx in c:/ for windows users).

You can easily convert this into a Parallels disk image using their \'Transporter\' or a disk image for Qemu by placing apps.vmdk in the same directory as (e.g) qemu-img.exe, and then executing this command.

qemu-img convert apps.vmdk -O vmdk apps.img (Windows)
./qemu-img convert apps.vmdk apps.img -O raw (OS X)

You can also move all your settings, applications, drivers, etc to a new Haiku revision by using Simple Backup on your home directory and then copying it to a new Haiku revision. The Haikuware superpack built everything into the home directory so everything is one place, and you can easily backup and restore your settings on a new Haiku revision.
