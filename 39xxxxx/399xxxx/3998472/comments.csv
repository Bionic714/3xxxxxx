,mikhun,2009-12-20T15:07Z,"Please seed! I've been after Pearls Before Swine stuff for years, & now I've found some, after several days I've only got 61%. "
,mikhun,2009-12-21T14:56Z,"Well, thank you - whoever you are. I'm at 99.8% now...hope I get the final 0.2%! Then I'll seed for quite a while. It's  great stuff, & has a few tracks from The Use of Ashes, which was my favourite album for years in the 70s."
