This is a 2cd set of previously unreleased vintage Pearls Before Swine recordings featuring '60s and '70s demos, out-takes, studio recordings, works in progress - many songs that have never appeared before on any Pearls Before Swine album. Disk Two features a complete early 70's live concert performance as well as other vintage 70's live recordings and radio sessions. An amazing view of Tom Rapp's personal tape archives.
