Noisy, inconsiderate neighbors? 

this is a 60 minute mp3 of multi-frequency white noise geared at suppressing the loud, bassy thumps of obnoxious neighbors in apartments/townhouse/condo settings. The better the stereo, the more effective it is. Give it a try.

Instructions for use: This file should loop seamlessly if you're using an mp3 player on looped playback. haven't experimented with cd playback, .mp3 (CDR) capable audio systems might be an option. I use a PSP for now. Good luck. Spread the word, and please comment.

Try the new version and see if you like it better:
