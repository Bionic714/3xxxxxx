,effective,2008-02-02T13:34Z,I live in a condo above a coffee shop does this mask the bass thump for the inconsiderate assholes that pump the stereo at 3 am?
,azmanon,2008-02-28T22:10Z,great idea. I'll try this on my neighbors!
,p_lin,2008-05-19T02:06Z,"dude, this is awesome.  it totally drowns out my noisy roommate.  one tip: I usually crank this up and combine with earplugs and I can't hear a thing."
,krapnek,2010-02-24T16:59Z,This could save my sanity and therefore help me avoid consecutive life sentences for the crime I'm contemplating every friday and saturday night. Thanks.

,computermek,2011-03-10T02:04Z,"I downloaded this 3 years ago. This is a life saver. I use it on my laptop hooked up to an amplifier. I turn the bass to medium on low volume, masks my neigbour's rap music. Thanks to the uploader."
,summer1967love,2011-11-12T21:03Z,"I'm down with this idea. Where I live I'm the loudest organism, so I'm not sure how this will be best used but probably before sleep. Thank you my purist cousin.."
