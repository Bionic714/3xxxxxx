I'm using Vista Ultimate 64bit so...
software not working in Vista 64bit - I don't know why...
but!..

1. first you need to install Win XP;
2. from Win XP with Paragon Partition Manager 9.0 you need to prepare partition (Install New OS) for another OS (Vista 64bit). you need to hide partition with Win XP;
3. restart PC and install Vista 64bit;
4. with Paragon Partition Manager 9.0 Boot Manager prepare PC booting for two OS. now Paragon Partition Manager 9.0 fully working in Vista XP.

P.S. all info from software Help menu

Regards
