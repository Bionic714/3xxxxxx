,flphpp,2008-01-23T18:30Z,Why have'nt the episodes from the 15th(Denzel) and 18th(Diane Lane) surfaced?
,H20H,2008-01-23T19:14Z,"They were realeased, but did not show up anywhere. I don't know why. And prolly i'm not so called ""l337"" enough to get them. 

I've also got monday's show, but mp4 version was already uploaded, so prolly it's not needed."
,death734,2008-01-23T21:34Z,well most people still use xvid in avi as its more compatible and more recognized then an mp4 file
,kughove,2008-01-27T17:21Z,"I to prefer xvid than mp4, more compatible."
