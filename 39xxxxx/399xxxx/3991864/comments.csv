,Sven the swede,2008-01-23T20:34Z,"How could it be true that this version is 50% faster than other Windows Vista versions due to the fact that some non-essential Windows Vista programs and services have been removed? I find that highly unlikely. One more thing, this version sounds buggy if one of the most basic Windows functions such as renaming folders does not work. Everything looks good from the description though. Anyone who trid it yet who could post a short review?

I've got someting really strange. I checked if this version was working and installed it on a different partition. It worked alright!! But after switching back to XP on the other partition, so i could reformat the partition with Vista installed, it didn't let me: ""Acces denied. One ore more files are open or in use by other programs"" or something. Even manually i couldn't remove any Vista OS files from within XP. Why is this happening? And how to fix this? Any idea?"

Great torrent! Had no problem downloading, and was able to install within an hour without needing to burn a CD (just mount the .iso with Daemon Tools). 

Vista is spectacular, this version works great. A couple missing sounds here and there, and without the included games- but everything works great. Aero is amazing! 

The cracks that came with the torrent worked perfectly- as I now have a licensed version of Vista. 

Definately get this one if you're looking for Vista Premium!

,janlafata,2008-02-29T19:05Z,"mcube. I'm really delighted with trying out this lite version of Home Premium. I ran a hacked full version of Home Premium for awhile, but I got tired of the slowness and the bloat, so I switched back to XP. When I am through downloading this today though, I think I will give it a try. One big question though...I understand your need to cut out the bloat to keep the OS small, but I really would have liked to have the Text-To-Speech engine still in there. I have a couple of programs that I run that I think might depend on it. That is, unless they would run without it. Do you know? Do they install, like, their own speech engine? The programs that I use are called ReadPlease Plus and NewsAloud. If not, is there anyway to get the Vista Text-To-Speech engine back in there. From what little research I did, I found that Vista uses something called SAPI 5.3 as their Text-To-Speech component. XP uses 5.1. 5.1 is downloadable but 5.3 is not. And I don't think 5.1 would work on Vista. Also, would there be a way to get it off of a full Vista DVD and if so, how would I do that without doing a complete reinstall? If anybody else knows,, chime in! "

To fix folder rename problem google, download & run FD32.reg

To fix the missing .dll problem google, download & copy gameux.dll under C:/windows/system32

Ok, for all the people out there doubthing about this torrent:

-> Yes, your Anti-Virus software may report 1 or 2 trojans, BUT THEY ARE NOT!! So, just make up your mind and decide if you want this or not, its up to you!

For me, Panda anti-virus reported a trojan and a backdoor, than I scan it with Norton anti-virus (one of the best out there, if not the best) and show nothing and found nothing, no trojans and no virus and no shit!

->Just burn the ISO to a CD (its only 700MB), insert it in the drive, follow the instructions and the installer will do the rest.

->Do not enter any key and do not Install updates during installation, you may be asked to, but just skip that part as I did.

->After 30 minutes you will have Vista as your Operating System up and running.

->Than follow the instructions to Crack Vista.

->After that, you can start your windows updates. 
Go to Windows update and download any update you want... 

...BUT DO NOT DOWNLOAD THESE:
---> KB940510
---> KB929391
---> KB931573

....Do whatever you do, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THAT UPDATES, your you will probably end up with nothing afetr 30 days.

-> Than you can safely install your antivirus and scan your system with it. If your antivirus previously detected the crack as a virus, it will remove it if it still there and you have nothing to worry about.

-> Resuming: this works, has no virus and validates! Just don't download that 3 updates!

Have fun :)"
,BornKillaz,2008-03-04T13:57Z,"One  more thing i forgot to mention:
when one of the 3 updates that you must not download showup, just right click on it and select ""Ignore"", that way Vista will present you whith other updates that will not show up until you ""Ignore"" the ones we do not need at all. ;)"
,testdrive15,2008-03-04T19:48Z,"when you install vista, will all the things on the harddrive be deleted? do i have to install everything again like games and other programs?"
,BornKillaz,2008-03-04T21:55Z,"I've installed this on my laptop that was running XP Home and it just kept ""My Documents"" folder and a few other things, everything else will be gone and you will have to reinstall your games and stuff. 

But at Microsoft website there is a informative table about that, I think. Look in there for more info.

Remember, this version has been tunned with vLite (www.vlite.net) and is perfect for those who dont want to take mutch system resources.

If you want all the stuff, than download one of the 4GB versions. Only English language is available in this version.

But this version is very fast and does a great job. I'm happy with it."

,BornKillaz,2008-03-10T12:54Z,"daniel_robinson, as the torrent name says, this is a LITE version, and many utilities do not come with it, unfortunly for you, one of those is the encrypt/decrypt windows tool.

Try to copy the files to a CD or USB storage device, and decript them on another machine.


FOR ALL TE OTHERS:
 this version does not include all the AERO potencial, AERO effects will not work. 
And it's not the Graphics card fault, couse the minimum for AERO to works is 128MB and I have 248MB, so forget it.

i have deleted what it said was a virus and carrying on with download, but for people who have downloaded... is this a virus?"
,BornKillaz,2008-03-11T18:12Z,"The ""virus""?? is the file ""VistaValidate.exe"". 
Try this, follow all the intructions to crack vista exept the last one, that says to run ""VistaValidate.exe"".

I might be wrong, but I think that you won't need to run it in order to get your Vista validated.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

Remember, all the crack does is to stop the 30 days countdown to activate windows, so, just run the crack chech to verify if you successfully crack it, but do not run the ""VistaValidate.exe"".

PS: At the time I'm not so sure about ""VistaValidate.exe"" being totally clean from virus, so just don't run it. ;)"
,BornKillaz,2008-03-11T18:17Z,"daniel_robinson, if you installed vista hover XP, than you need reinstall XP.

Thanks a lot in advance!""




Shawarmakriger, 
     Just did this a few hours ago. first you gotta choose between bootcamp (free with os x leopard) or another program such as parallels or VMware Fusion. in bootcamp you hafta re boot your mac every time you want to switch between operating systems but if your going to use windows a lot for gaming it's a good and free choice because when u reboot your computer in windows it'll be using all of your processing power and memory. other programs such as parallels or vmware fusion make it possible to run windows along side of mac os x. my advice is to go with VMware fusion because it runs vista better then parallels and it's really user friendly and has a lot of helpful features. you can also download it free here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3900541/VMware_Fusion_1.1_(62573)___serial  fusion creates a virtual computer in mac os x and the entire windows operating system runs in a separate mac os x window. you also can bring it to full screen mode and run windows like you would see as if it were running on a PC. then exit full screen mode and your bac to mac OS X.

so lets assume you decided on VMware Fusion. so you've downloaded Fusion. now download this vista file here and after thats downloaded simply open fusion, instal and when it says to instal operating system pick windows in the first drop down window and windows vista in the second one. then it will ask to instal from bootable cd or bootable disk. check the bubble beside disk, browse for the vista file (not the folder but the instal file inside the folder) and start the installation. instal windows completely with out the serial number and after completely installed follow the vista crack guide to register your vista.

NOTE: the crack files will not open in OS X so make sure your in windows when you instal them. you can access them from the VMware fusion shared shortcut on your windows desktop.

Hope this helps

Thank you very much for the guide. You've been a great help to me and, I'm sure, many others. There is, however a small issue, I can't turn on the sound. In the Start bar in Vista, the speaker icon says ""No audio output is installed"". Is there a way to deal with this?"

   I had the same problem but when i downloaded all 41 updates from the auto update program in the controll panel, it automatically fixed the problem itself. if that doesn't work try putting in you mac os x leopard disk install disk 1 in and open it in windows (don't try to run the intall just explore in it) then you'll see a folder named bootcamp. open it and it'll say driver, go in and install the sound driver and or all drivers if you wish.

Maybe this will help you bro.

Just burn the ISO to a CD (its only 700MB), insert it in the drive, follow the instructions and the installer will do the rest.

->Do not enter any key and do not Install updates during installation, you may be asked to, but just skip that part as I did.

->After 30 minutes you will have Vista as your Operating System up and running.

->Than follow the instructions to Crack Vista.

->After that, you can start your windows updates. 
Go to Windows update and download any update you want... 

...BUT DO NOT DOWNLOAD THESE:
---> KB940510
---> KB929391
---> KB931573

....Do whatever you do, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THAT UPDATES, your you will probably end up with nothing afetr 30 days.

-> Than you can safely install your antivirus and scan your system with it. If your antivirus previously detected the crack as a virus, it will remove it if it still there and you have nothing to worry about."

,VxOsx,2008-07-27T02:34Z,"nradam : You don't have to write it to a dvd/cd, if you don't want to, you must partition a drive and just run installation after download and you can install to your partitioned drive.

Therefor having XP and Vista on one computer, so if something goes wrong go back on XP, install Partition Magic (get it from TPB) and delete the partition, resize the original drive and all is back to normal. ;)"

,TheDarkLight,2008-08-15T20:28Z,"Torrent works, but recommend you find and dl a Activator instead of using a crack. I would recommend: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4312036/Windows_Vista_OEM_Activator_(Does_Any_Vista) . It works using it, vista passes wga and is seen as a legit system so yea."
,TheDarkLight,2008-08-15T20:29Z,Just don't put in a Serial # when installing.

3.SEED Mother Fuckers i want this torrent!!"

Anyone having the same expirience? Need help!"

,LordOrwell,2009-09-24T20:42Z,why did you strip out media center!?!  That's the only freakin reason to USE home premium over windows basic!

I formatted my laptop with it and it all seemed to work fine, except one thing. I can't install Service Pack 1. I've tried all the troubleshooting methods suggested in various sites, but still nothing. error 0x80070002, this is the error that i get. I don't know what's wrong. 
I've activated it with the product key i had on my original vista, before the format and back then Service Pack was installed. 
Any help would be great cause I really need it to be fixed =/"
