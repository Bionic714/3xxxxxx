,this_day_is_ours,2008-04-08T13:43Z,"What? no way is this album disappointing. Sure it''s nothing like the poison but once you accept that you see it's actually way better. I'm quite annoyed though, i actually paid for this and never got any bonus track, so i might torrent this anyway."
,erbomb,2008-09-07T19:00Z,"This album isn't disappointing in any way even though I've got tired of most of the songs but Hearts Burst Into Fire fullfills the whole album, damn I love that song!"
