Decisive Battles of World War II: Battles in Italy



Part of the Decisive Battles Series, Battles in Italy is an operational wargame that takes you to three of the toughest fought battles in the Mediterranean -- the invasions of Sicily, Salerno, and Anzio. You are given complete control of either the allies or the axis armies and must utilize strategy and tactics to overcome your opponent. All three campaigns incorporate many new improvements and enhancements to the Decisive Battles series. Some of these updates include rules for surrender, political units, cooperation between countries, and improved amphibious invasions!

Install screen is a non-English language - German I think (but I'm probably wrong).  Game is in English.


This is one of my favorite series.  I'm looking for Decisive Battles of World War II: Battles in Normandy.  If you have it, please UL it.
