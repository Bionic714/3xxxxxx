You can log on a see a  Macromedia of the same thing I am uploading. Just CLICK ON the link and pick the Hatsu basho 2008 - Jour (NOW the day you want) - Makuuchi. This is SCREEN RECORDED and about 640x480 quality ( so so ) but does included Japanese sound commentary and should be a quick download with a few seeders. As always, if you do not want matches only you can always get the HIGH QUALITY full day from ZLO here:

This was a day of either GOOD SUMO or a trend of BAD SUMO. See what you think?
