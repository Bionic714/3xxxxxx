ArtyTorrent Music Production Pack 24-Oneshots-Snare Drum WAV samples 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the second of several packs of drum oneshots I shall be uploading in the coming days. (The first included kick drums).
Included here are around 750 snare drum samples for use in dance music production.

All samples are 44KHz normalized and trimmed WAVs for use with all major samplers and sequencers.
Programs for FL Studio's DirectWave sampler are additionally included for users of that app. UnRAR the dwp programs into a directory containing the multiple sample folders to load them up.

These samples are divided into the following categories:

Chicago Fire - Deep and Progressive House, Old Skool and Electro.
Ghetto Electro.
Loopmasters Disco and Disco House.
Vengeance Essential Club Sounds 1.
Vengeance Essential Club Sounds 2.
Vengeance Essential Electro.
Vengeance Essential House 1.
Vengeance Minimal House 1 - Claps and Snares/
