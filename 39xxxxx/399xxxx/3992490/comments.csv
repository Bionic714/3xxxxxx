,chowdan,2008-04-30T02:47Z,"Click SOiLwORk's user name and just download the rosetta stone installer

quite simple actually"
,anarchyman1121,2008-05-23T16:33Z,"if those of you who are asking about the version, could actually read you would realize it says
""Should work with any version of Rosetta Stone."""
,tu123,2008-09-28T10:07Z,"thanks for this on, soilwork!
the iso is ok, i mounted it with toast, but rosetta stone v3 still cannot find it ... (and keeps asking me to insert a language cd in my cdrom drive)

can anyone help?"
,Scion343,2008-10-20T17:39Z,"I keep getting the same problem as tu123, fucking Rosetta software isn't detecting the CD, either burned to an actual cd or mounted on DAEMON TOOLS. Anyone got a solution? "
,Staloreye,2010-06-18T00:30Z,"once ive mounted the installer and installed the program, what do i do? extract the language discs into the program file? or mount it?"
,rali0601,2011-05-02T02:24Z,"than you very much for these files... I was wondering if you had or if you knew where I can download Italian level 4 and 5?
Best regards."
