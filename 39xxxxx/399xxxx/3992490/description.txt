This is the language disc for ITALIAN LEVELS ONE AND TWO for the Rosetta Stone program.

In order for this language to work, you need to have the main installer disc downloaded.  (Can be found by clicking my username)

Once this file is completed, you must have PowerISO or another .iso Mounter/Burner to utilize this language.  Open it up in PowerISO and burn it to a disc or mount it.  I always burned it to a disc, but this file is so large you may need to mount it.  Remember, when you are using the language, you must keep that disc in the computer during all periods of use.

This is a great way to learn Italian at two basic levels.
