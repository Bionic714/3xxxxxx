,connor_hot,2008-01-26T09:19Z,The Links are for XBOX 360 controllers you wish to use
,peeweesweden,2008-01-26T09:57Z,"The uploader saying there is no virus in the upload is kind of having a leper giving you a facial, it's not really working. Actually, it suggests otherwise, that there _is_ a virus in the upload. Sure, there are some arsehats out there who doesn't know how to confirm a trojan, but I'd rather have one or more of the leechers clear it. 

""reported to TPB and have there registration removed""
Yeah, it's so hard to register again. "

,Soondead,2008-01-26T17:37Z,"Actually, peeweesweden never said there was a trojan in the download. What he pointed out was the commonly known fact that you can't trust the uploader when he says a torrent is trojan free.

I don't know who you're calling ""low life scum"" for pointing out trojans, personally I like it when ppl give a heads-up."
