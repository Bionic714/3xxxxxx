,bowseroffun,2008-09-02T22:20Z,well rolf knowing EWQL huge sized stuff i have doubts the strings are 4MB specially with rar compression D:
,raxxroth,2008-12-26T00:04Z,"Anyone who has tried to download it? 
On the East West Quantum Leap website there are no softwares named like that though... Or is it a package of strings from the platinum version?

Good work though, keep the EWQL downloads coming. The more, the better! :)"

,the5count,2009-08-26T22:08Z,Thanks for this.
,keysofanxiety,2010-12-16T13:55Z,"Yep, these are a collection of torrent files, and it's all working fine with good speeds, apart from one issue. 

The problem is that the fourth DVD (ewqlso-strings4.iso) will NOT download- it's hung on 33.0%, and there aren't any seeders. All of the peers are stuck on the same percentage.

I had a similar problem with another Platinum Strings DELIRIUM torrent I downloaded; on that one, DVD 3 & 4 were combined- but there weren't any seeders for the 4th DVD either.

Obviously, it's useless without all six DVDs, so my advice is to save yourself some bandwidth until somebody decides to seed the 4th DVD... :("
