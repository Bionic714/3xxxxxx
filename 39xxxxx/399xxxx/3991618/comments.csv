,xLordnashx,2008-01-23T22:19Z,"so this is what happen to my friend, he completed the download with bitlord. he unzipped and got corrupted files. I told he to use utorrent and do a force recheck. after checking with utorrent. utorrent only picked up the files as 34% completed. So bitlord must have pulled down 66% junk corrupted files. utorrent is redownloading correctly."
