No product key is needed. Windows Vista is activated upon installation. Windows is fully patched with all \\\\\\\"important\\\\\\\" Windows Updates to 8th may 2007. The 512Mb RAM memory requirement is reduced to just 256Mb.
The requirement of almost 8Gb of disk space is reduced to less than 3Gb.

Internet Explorer 7

You also have the new Aero theme in this edition of Windows and the ability to use Windows Update.
