,y.a.b.,2008-01-25T22:05Z,"pocketpc2004: This just came out two days ago and i have hunted on forums for any word as far as changes to this from v3264 and I have not seen anything yet. Cross your fingers I guess, or hunt like mad on forums."

,carlosrajas,2008-01-26T05:20Z,"hi m4rkuz, thanks for this precious up....just a doubt....if this sp3 is about 311 mb then how a complete win xp already streamed with this pack is just 592mb (y.a.b release 3995795 ) ? looks a tiny
xp, i don't know, can anybody explain ?"
,y.a.b.,2008-01-26T07:41Z,"carlosrajas: I used this very sp3 3282 to make the full integrated image. After integration, file sizes change adn a few things get add. the source xp disk i used is only 529mb, so it did not grow in size that much. Had a sp2 image been used to make the sp3 3282 image, the file size would have been larger."
[T],AxMan2007,2008-01-26T09:09Z,"@pocketpc2004
HDA (high definition audio) isn't really a bug you just need to install 'oem' KB's for it, they won't be include in final.

Y.a.B. thanks a lot for the perfect slipstreamed build ."
,carlosrajas,2008-01-26T20:01Z,"ok, thank you very much indeed to m4rkuz and y.a.b for their cooperation in keeping this site better and better.......

pitty that some people do not understand the importance of being a friend instead a moron.........

a great hug from the people of salvador,bahia,brasil....keep it up  forever"
,y.a.b.,2008-01-26T21:56Z,"Windows.XP.Pro.SP3.3282.version 2.Corp no crack needed, etc, is now up. This new image is based off a SP2 corp disk with SP3v3282 integrated using command lines.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3997343

carlosrajas: now you can see the difference in size by using two different xp source disks.

sp0+sp3integrated=592mb
sp2+sp3integrated=640mb

,JimmyTheGent,2008-01-27T02:12Z,"Thanks Y.A.B.! 
I just removed my upload because the link as well as the file were both v3264. 
SORRY for the mix up everyone, ~Jimmy~"
[T],liluser,2008-01-27T02:51Z,"this one passes all the online updates...

,y.a.b.,2008-01-27T08:50Z,"wolfz1: I removed the smaller sp0+sp3 for a few reasons. 1: i forgot to put the pidgen.dll file onto the iso (the thing that no longer asks for activation). and 2: That smaller sp0+sp3 would not install onto a usb hard drive. 
The sp2+sp3 image already comes with pidgen.dll (part of the untouched sp2 corp image) and did not have any troubles installing onto a usb hard drive (on my system anyways)"
,Mindwarper,2008-01-27T20:03Z,"m4rkuz thanks for uploading this, will help seed as much as I possibly can...

I can put this to good use in creating customised disks for myself (& testing purposes as well)"

,Metalmayhem,2008-02-15T22:24Z,Does anyone have problems when you put the computer on standby or hibernate mode?? Because ever since I installed this updated when I turn the computer back on from those modes it goes to the blue screen and restarts.
,t-carat,2008-03-23T23:34Z,"I need seed!

And some other things too but I won't push it..."
