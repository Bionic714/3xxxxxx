Hellgate: London's first major content update, the Stonehenge Chronicles, launched early this morning. After a day's pause to exterminate two pesky bugs, brave Hellgaters have already ventured out into the hellspawn-infested realms beyond the safety of the monolithic ruins built by druids long past. Sending back word of their conquests in forms both written and visual, reports from the front lines are unanimous: Stonehenge shall not fall into demon hands. Putting their rivalries aside, Templar, Hunters, and Cabalists have banded together to seek out the enemy in its lair, felling minions and masters of hell's castes to reach an eternal evil.

In addition to this new subscriber content, all players get to enjoy a host of fresh features, gameplay tweaks, and a reworked Evoker class. Buddy lists are now account-based, the crafting system has been streamlined, and the user interface now has scaling elements. Add in abundant bug fixes and improved textures on party members and you've one heck of a giant content update.
