Almost as legendary as SMiLE itself the VigOtone 110/111 SMiLE 2 disc package.
Every Beach Boy/Brian Wilson fan flipped in 1993 when this surfaced.
Most of these tracks at the time had not been heard or heard of.
The SMiLE out-take "George Fell Into His French Horn" was issued on vinyl 6 years earlier in lesser quality. A new recording that most had only heard of was the SMiLE Era Party, which features Brian recording a dinner party at his home.
Disc 2 has many out-takes / alternate versions along with the sound track from Brian's performance on TV of "Surf's Up".
The set was also issued in a 3 Lp set of yellow, green and blue vinyl.
