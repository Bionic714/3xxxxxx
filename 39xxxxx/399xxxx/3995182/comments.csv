,Nabarun,2008-04-24T16:36Z,Yeah. This Rock-Bluelady group is shit! They make terrible mistakes and don't even bother to admit that or re-up a proper thing. Most of the files are not even ac3 5.1 and the videos are much worse and frame rates are different. These morons don't even know what they are uploading.
