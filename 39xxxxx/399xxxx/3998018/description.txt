Pink Floyd: The Wall (1982)(Special Edition)(Widescreen)The 20th anniversary release of Pink Floyd: The Wall pays tribute to the film's legion of fans by offering a flawless print of the film (transferred from the original widescreen interpositive).
.
Includes:The inclusion of the "Hey You" sequence that was excised from the film.
         The video of "Another Brick in the Wall.
         The theatrical trailer.

The plot of The Wall is fairly simple. A burnt-out, haunted rock star goes bonkers amid a scenario rife with symbolism, vivid animated sequences, and glorious Pink Floyd songs. Bob Geldof gives a powerful performance as the musician Pink; notable work is also done by Eleanor David as Pink's wife and Bob Hoskins as Pink's manager. The "plot" works surprisingly well within the confines of the music, but it's unfortunate that so much of Pink's problems in The Wall are blamed on the women in his life Ã¢?? his mother and wife.
