Editorial Reviews

From Bookmarks Magazine
Like some of the post-9/11 literature, Shalimar delves deep into the 
roots of terrorism and explores the turmoil generated by different faiths 
and cultures attempting to coexist. How can nations, Rushdie asks, go 
from near-peaceful ethnic and religious acceptance to violent conflict 
within a mere generation? Critics agree that Rushdie has brilliantly 
unraveled the construction of terrorists: some of them fight for ideas; 
others fight to fulfill vows or, if they are men, to reclaim their wives.-

Shalimar is at once a political thriller, folk tale, slapstick comedy, 
wartime adventure, and work of science fiction, pop culture, and magical 
realism. In shimmering (if sometimes baroque) language, Rushdie invokes 
clever satire and imaginative wordplay. Yet, despite its diverse genres 
and styles, Shalimar is, at heart, a story of love, honor, and revenge?and 
the global consequences of such emotions and actions. Critics particularly 
praised Rushdie?s shocking description of Shalimar?s transformation 
into a cold-blooded Islamic terrorist, from his participation in training 
camps to forced humiliations before Taliban leaders. Similarly, wrenching 
descriptions of pre- and post-war Kashmir, his homage to a paradise 
lost, confirm Rushdie?s brilliant powers of observation and keen social 
insight. Some reviewers felt that some characters lacked psychological 
depth or complete plausibility, or were too allegorical, but most described 
Shalimar as convincingly real?too real, even.

In the 21st century, Shalimar?s painful, terrifying themes are both 
fantastical and devastatingly real. To evidence otherwise, Rushdie offers 
a note of cautious optimism: people can work out their differences if 
left alone by ideologues or fanatics. Shalimar provides a timely, ultimately 
idealistic, message for our times.

From AudioFile
The former U.S. Ambassador to India is murdered outside his daughter's 
apartment in Los Angeles by an assassin known as Shalimar the Clown. 
The political situation in Kashmir and the betrayal of Shalimar by his 
Hindu bride are mirrored in interconnected narratives. Aasif Mandvi 
rises to the challenge of a complicated story that travels the globe. 
Locations include Strasbourg under the rule of the Germans in WWII, 
France, India, Pakistan, and the U.S. Who knows if every accent is perfect? 
The important thing is that the myriad characters of varying nationalities 
own plausible, distinctive voices. Particularly effective is Mandvi's 
emotional understatement in the face of the escalating violence. A.B.
