,al1and,2008-02-01T16:40Z,"great acting here, Cate Blanchette is impressive...of course, I overlooked Clive Owen's acting a bit, a little preoccupied with his rugged good looks!!  Good movie though, enjoyed the history."
,BrenJames,2008-02-06T00:41Z,Brilliant film. Proves the Brits make the US film industry eat shit all day and all night long.. ha ha
,nic_tester,2008-02-09T13:28Z,"Thanx for uploading this here, I just hate the thought that someone would actually have to pay for this miserable movie. "
,JetJaguarr,2008-02-11T18:13Z,5.1 wins
,blindperson,2008-02-17T07:40Z,"I'm an American guy.  Funny thing is that the guy who described the difference between American and Brit movie goers and how the Brits would be the ones that like this film is the guy that convinced me to download this and watch it.  Don't know if I should thank him yet or not, so I wont look up the nickname.  Thanks to everyone that uploads good copies of movies!  Seriously.  Thanks to everyone that uploads these!  Groups or individuals.  Thanks to you all!"
,Pereubu,2008-02-22T10:06Z,"Thx FXG team. Too bad the movie is only a shadow of the first one. Basically not very good - slow, dreary and confusing- watch ""Elizabeth"" instead if you havent seen it. "
,MightyDevil,2008-02-23T11:03Z,"Does someone know where that I can get dutch subtitles for the FXG version? 
Thank you "

Thanks..."
,kbowk2,2008-06-11T16:23Z,the movie sounds bad dammit.  Y is it that every comment bank seems to pay out Americans.  Really this doesn't have much to do with Americans.  At least no-one has mentioned politics yet.  
,master_b415,2008-07-17T22:45Z,"Nicely done. Total package in a smaller file. Loved it, thank you."

A: 10
V: 9"
,Naralli15,2010-03-14T10:08Z,Almost forgot. English subtitles are embedded in the movie for the parts in which Spanish is spoken.
,thebeastcalledpoopy,2010-12-22T21:08Z,To those who take so much time belittling others opinions of whether this is a good or rubbish movie - try and remember that taste is subjective
,Kadanz,2011-10-09T01:33Z,"All Americans should watch this, so they never forget who to thank, for their existence..."
,ghost808,2012-02-08T23:28Z,"All Americans should watch this, so they never forget who to thank, for their existence...

I've watched the movie and I still thank the Indians, Africans and Mexicans for Americans existence..."
,ghost808,2012-02-08T23:46Z,"I'm confused...I've watched the movie, and I still thank the American Indians, The Africans and The Mexicans!"
,ikoberry,2012-04-17T18:59Z,"@kadanz who am I thanking and why? as a native of the north american continent I would rather have thanked the palefaces to go back home, so how about you let me thank you for keeping your opinion to yourself... you have us confused with someone who actually cares what you think."
