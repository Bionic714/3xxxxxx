I look at a steer and think to myself....now thats some good eating! In fact most animals taste pretty damn good! One of the best deals I have ever found is to buy lame and injured cattle at auction, kill them, carve them up and get the tasty bloody flesh into my freezer."
,VeganFreak,2008-05-28T01:51Z,"You talk like you are trying to defensively strike some carnal fear into some vegan ears, yet you forget vegans used to eat meat just like you, and we both know from experience that you can't truly justify eating meat. If taste is the only justification for eating meat, why not eat some retarded human beings, or old people, or anyone else we deem can be sacrificed for some reason? It doesn't do justice to the fact that both animals and humans have equal capacity to suffer, nor the fact that it is absolutely unnecessary to use animals as mere objects. You talk tough but your words are incapable of defending your actions. All life on this planet relies on vegan sources, all nutrients have vegan sources, so harvesting early food sources directly is a way to actively practice positive intellectual evolution, help the environment, and in very possible circumstances, help your health. You should relax a little and do some research before muttering your ""I am superior"" rhetoric, vegans have heard it before, try to be original."

Hey wordofdoom, as a fellow meat eater I am soooo glad to have such intellectual heavyweights as yourself on our side to put forth a good argument.
You fucking idiot. Only a child would think the crap you wrote was entertaining or funny or anything but puerile and flaccid, like your dick."

i try to not eat meat. but somhow it always finds a way into my diet. maybe because i dont cook my own food. i probably eat 20% meat.

[T],dramacore,2011-09-19T10:39Z,"also after noticing the ignorant troll comment about vegan etc. it's clear they didn't watch this.

there's nothing gruesome involving heart wrenching slaughter footage in this.  it's not trying to make you a vegetarian or vegan.  it ultimately felt much more scientific and just poking people to consider the notion that animals are capable of a great array of emotions, just as humans."
