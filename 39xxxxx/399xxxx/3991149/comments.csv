I Will Keep You updated As to wether This Activator works On A Fresh SP3 Install. I Wll Aso Notify The Public If the Activator Backfires Afte the SP3 Patch."

,moortser,2008-11-03T12:09Z,"I've run into problems with this activator. It was working fine, but now I'm stuck at login. I press enter to log into a Windows account and then suddenly it's asking me Yes or No to activate before logging in. If I press Yes it tells me win is already activated and returns(!) to the login screen. If I press No it just returns to the login screen.

Any ideas on what to do?"
