(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.)

Plone was an electronic music band from Birmingham, England.

The group was created in late 1994 when Mark Cancellara & Mike Johnston started to buy old analogue keyboards and fx and began to rehearse making huge soundscapes. Mike was living with Billy Bainbridge (who was in another band at the time, Supernal, also containing members of electro band sol dat) who bought himself a keyboard and joined the band.


The band started gigging as support to local bands such as Pram & Broadcast. In 1997 the band were approached by Wurlitzer Jukebox who released the single "Press a Key". On the strength of this the band were signed to Warp and in September 1998 released the single 'plock'. This was tipped as one of the singles of the year by NME, Melody Maker, Dazed & Confused etc.

An album For Beginner Piano was released in September 1999 to widespread critical acclaim...
