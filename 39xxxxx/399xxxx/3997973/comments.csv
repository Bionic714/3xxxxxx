All you need is the folder to which you've previously installed the games. You can copy/move the folder to wherever you like, whether it's another partirion, or a USB, and still run the games. To uninstall the games, just do it regularly through ""add or remove programs"" in the controll panel. The reason that i've packed all the games within a single executable file is that I wanted to make it easier for a few ""dummies"", that may want to download it. :)

The ""setup"" files are standard for all my games."
