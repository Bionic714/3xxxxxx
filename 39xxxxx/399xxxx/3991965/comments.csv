,thecrowman,2008-01-24T23:07Z,Hey uploader! Don't you know that you have to seed when you upload something? The torrent is new and as I see it's abandoned...
,doncollum,2008-01-25T00:45Z,"Hey when is the dip who uploaded this gonna allow someone to let them off the hook and be a reliable seed?

*sigh*"
,electroacoustic,2008-01-25T10:52Z,Nothing is abandoned. I have too slow connection to upload this in minute :P Be patient.
,NYCRocker,2008-01-25T12:50Z," Hey EA, Is anything crazy I have to do with this install? I've already got one installed but it sounds like crap. Do I have to put the .dll in the VST subdirectory(whatever the hell that is) or do I just unpack,install and go? Thanks."
,electroacoustic,2008-01-25T16:39Z,"I have installes VST in ""C:\Program Files\Steinberg\VstPlugins"". This path you select during installation (you can select any path to install GP3 VST plugin but \Steinberg\VstPlugins is recommended if you using other software that using VST). Then you should replace original ""Guitar Rig 3.dll"" from VST directory by .dll provided by me."
,NYCRocker,2008-01-26T04:51Z,Ok...I'm getting it now. Still seeding I hope? Everyone? Thanks!
,NYCRocker,2008-01-28T12:29Z,Most excellent! I got it all installed and running like a top...thanks again!
,skitt123,2008-02-24T07:18Z,"I think I intalled everything correctly, but after running the plugin for about five minutes there's a popup window telling me they know it's not genuine.  I placed the dll in the VSTPlugins folder, I replaced the exe file in the programs folder... still nothing.  What am I doing wrong?"
,electroacoustic,2008-02-27T20:33Z,"skitt123, first install 3.0 then 3.0.1 and then replace files."
,grafikkort,2008-03-09T13:03Z,"use surplus keyboard as footcontroller.
works good  esp  ofc  with loopmachine  :)"
,steveo3242391,2008-03-20T07:16Z,"I install it fine, then use it exit it, later come back on and the sound is all choppy, and I haven't touched anything in main settings, I have the correct input output settings, and it just worked fine before, the only thing to fix it is I have to delete everything from comp, and when I uninstall it doesn't do all so I have to find it, then I reinstall, anyone having same problem?"
,grafikkort,2008-03-31T19:38Z,"yes i have same prob as you mention.
i can open saved loopfiles, they play normal but when i try to use single effects  itsa blurr  "
,mm4free,2008-04-18T18:14Z,Does this one quite after a time like a demo?
,AMD freak,2008-04-27T12:16Z,"Works 100% on WinXP SP2
no bugz :)

Don't expect this shit to work good with your on-board audio crap chip and ASIO 4 all program!
Get a PRO audio card like Creative X-FI Platinum Fatal1ty Champion Series. I got my latency set at 5ms with no drop-outs or studdering etc and I can plug my guitar, mic etc... straight into I/O Drive and also program the included remote control to run music programs on my PC without touching my keyboard.

It's absolutly AWESOME and sounds sooo sweet too!

Thanks electroacoustic

,SMRT,2008-05-01T21:35Z,"Using this with a Behringer USB Guitar link. It's working great so far.

The Creative Fatality is a worthless card for guitars because it has no high impedance instrument inputs - just so you know you're using the wrong gear."
,mkngplns4nigel,2008-05-18T00:56Z,This Great! It kicks the snot out of Amplitube! Thanks a lot!
,Monstrosity,2008-06-26T20:45Z,"Awesome torrent, awesome program.
You need some top notch hardware and software to make the best use of it though.

Really nice presets as well."
,zachburn,2008-07-03T00:16Z,"hey i got this little message pop up when i opened it about ten minutes later it said that i was using a none valid copy and it had to be closed????

so whats up with that?"
,electroacoustic,2008-07-04T11:27Z,"zachburn, you must overwrite installed files by files from Fix.rar. (refer also my comment posted on 2008-01-25 16:39 CET)"
,dolphlundgren80,2008-07-27T05:45Z,"Okay, for anyone having issue, follow EXACTLY what electroacoustic said at 2008-02-27 20:33 CET. It will work in standalone mode (thanks electro!) absolutely perfectly. I've downloaded several other GR3 from PB and this one works 100% no virus!

Quick question, I run ProTools 7.4 LE, and although it works perfect as a standalone app, when I try and launch it as a plugin on a track with PT (tried both mono or stereo), it's not listed as a plugin. Any advice? TIA"
,dolphlundgren80,2008-07-27T05:46Z,"Never mind! Total n00b move, it is listed as a plugin under Effect -> Guitar Rig 3. electro for President!"
,dbaydoun,2008-08-17T07:27Z,"hey electro,
i installed 3.0 and then 3.1 and then i replaced the two files, it works fine in standalone mode but whenever i run it as a vst in protools it still comes up with that error message after about five minutes.  ive tried uninstalling then reinstalling and replacing again but it doesnt seem to work.  any advice?"
,G_Blackwood,2008-10-12T22:15Z,"Excellent upload... was looking for something to add to my Spectrasonics Bass...without having to play and guess with FL 8... :)


To all the ungrateful schmucks...

FUCK OFF!"
,Matt92,2008-11-10T20:42Z,"Thanks very much for this upload :)
one question though, Its working fine as a stand alone app, but when I chose it as a insert or plugin (if theyre the same thing, sorry im a n00b to this haha) it makes my computer crash, i have no idea why.

please help :("
,Chix_with_Dix,2008-12-13T21:35Z,"Thanx electro, u really kick my ass.  I submit to you greatness."
,Chix_with_Dix,2008-12-14T15:48Z,"This does not work with Cubase SX3 H2o, but i'm running Vista 32, so i'm unsure where the problem might be.  The standalone app runs great for me though."
,dbot,2009-06-23T08:07Z,sweet. perfect. thank you.  you are the man.
,Oriax666,2009-07-05T22:48Z,Seed!!!
,angus91120,2009-07-28T19:42Z,Can i just use a microphone plug in. i Have a cable that is 1/4 in at one end and 1/8 inch at the other. would it work???
,LoveSickDope,2009-07-30T21:27Z,"Angus yes it would.

I recommend LightSnake USB though.


THANK YOU ELECTROACOUSTIC.
Very nice torrent. Virus free and stable version."
,marshall01,2009-11-14T13:42Z,Excellent! THANK YOU!
