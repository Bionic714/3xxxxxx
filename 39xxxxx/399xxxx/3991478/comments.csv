,sonic_assassin,2008-01-28T22:33Z,"yay thanx for that!  Wow, the show is even more 'twee' than I remember at the time, it's awful. Hawkwind were like a diamond on a compost heap! Not too sure about Bob's eye-liner, though."
,merrytyme,2008-01-31T03:21Z,"Your welcome Sonic, 
Hawkwind was the main reason I bought this, tough to find only available as a Japanese Import, the UK version has no guests, I found that out the hard way."
