,stervendehoerenkachel,2008-01-25T23:24Z,"Of course it's an exe file, it's a fucking program."
,solidsnake332,2008-01-26T18:09Z,"You're a retard, no$gba doesn't install itself, so their is no need for just an exe file. You have no battery folder or anything so it's strange. Wouldn't trust it."
,stervendehoerenkachel,2008-01-26T18:55Z,"Hahaha, you're so funny, how are you planning to start a program if it isn't an exe file, what kind of extension should no$gba have? Download the free 2.6 version and look at the extension.

The battery folder is generated at the first run.

,Cavauro,2008-01-27T01:23Z,"I'm about as cautious as someone who uses sites like these can be so will be waiting for more comments before I try it.

Thank you for the upload."
,kingsnoopy1,2008-01-27T02:34Z,Worked perfectly for me : ) thanks dude!
,Nimtro,2008-01-29T07:04Z,"This work just fine for me.

,Johnny4,2008-02-18T16:57Z,does anyone know how i can open my savegame from no$ in the VBA-link? i want to trade pokemon with a friend of mine...
,demon15050,2008-02-25T04:49Z,Stupids you start the exe then when you play it all the folders come up like when you normally download it THINK!!!
,The_DeadDuck,2008-03-12T12:38Z,Not virused or anything. Works great.
,davefitz,2008-04-05T07:09Z,"This works great (although it still takes about 20 seconds to organize its swapfiles when it first starts), and right now this is the only way to get No$GBA 2.6a.

HOWEVER- if you use this and like it, please go to http://nocash.emubase.de/gba.htm and leave Martin Korth a donation, as soon as the Paypal button works. He's a great guy who's done a fantastic job (exactly how fantastic? Trust me, this code is TIGHT) and needs to eat like the rest of us.
Real scenesters stand by the scene! Support your friends!"
,gagegecko,2008-04-15T19:08Z,More like Solid dumbass.
,Ceskoadnan,2008-05-03T17:08Z,"and do u have any proof that martin has stolen this from a jap developer get if not stop fucking flaming people if u don,t have any proof of it"
,cheezepuffly,2008-05-11T06:24Z,"Ah just give him thr 2.50 for translating from japanese (assuming thats correct)


This file works fine, not all files work perfectly but better than the other crap out there"
,natchie,2008-06-10T16:01Z,Can You make the screen bigger when playing a DS game?
,zachattack90,2008-07-06T20:53Z,"yo, this is a totally sweet torrent, but when i have to choose a pokemon and battle the bird-thing, i always win and the game freezes. any thoughts?? Other than that, sweet upload."
,adinaq,2008-07-13T11:57Z,"ah yes, proof, the ""legal shield"" that protects even the guilty poeple amongst the innocent.. i could really give 2 shits out of anyones ass who stole or made what.  its been stolen from martin just the same, as will future versions and so on and so forth end up like all games and programs .. stolen and downloaded for free anyone with moral issuses and downloading stuff here is a hypocrit .. #1 reason to not pay for shit is to download it for free majority of shit isnt worth paying for as rushed out and played out as movies and  games are.. maybe if they made something worth a crap they might get money for it "

Can You make the screen bigger when playing a DS game?

This file is suspicious"
,jmid08,2008-08-01T00:12Z,It doesn't have a virus. I have a very good anti virus program that I pay 80$ a month for. Remember to extract the files. WinRar is good for this. Have fun!
,nitecreeper,2008-08-25T23:53Z,"Works great. Very noticeable improvement from 2.5c, Especially for everyone downloading this for Pokemon Pearl/Diamond. Outside environments are much smoother when running around.
No virus, the exe file is just the program (you'll need a Bios and firmware though if you don't have them). Other torrents have the Bios and firmware included if you need."
,tehhammer,2008-08-27T23:32Z,It works just fine. It's pointless though. VBA is so much better and you can direct download that from their website.
,linkinpark187,2008-09-11T20:16Z,"tehhammer, no$GBA doesn't apply to just GBA games.  I'll admit that, yes, VBA is better for GBA games, but no$GBA is the best for NDS emulating."
,Vegito-SSJ,2008-10-05T23:08Z,Very Clean Updated My Bitdefender 2009 And Tried it Clean And Great I`ll Try sedding For A Month
,Rovelius,2008-11-29T23:33Z,"You noobs are so funny. Ever heard of fake heuristic detections? Personally, as long as MBAM says it's ok, I'll just enjoy the damm software and stop being such an ass like you guys. :)"
,pcnoobwithexperience,2009-03-22T04:36Z,oh really solidsnake332 hes right you are a solid dumbass its a .rar file im assuming(havent started download yet..) but seriously dipshit...get your facts straight....
,xiIix,2009-04-25T10:02Z,It would be nice if the old snapshot files ran in the new version. my savegames won't load now.
,amk93,2009-06-17T04:10Z,I'm not sure if this is the only way to make the game larger but you can lower the resolution of your computer screen and the emulator will get bigger.
,1337sh33p,2009-06-17T06:46Z,"@amk93 

There are ""magnifiers"" available for NO$GBA, but in my experience they are very slow and your approach is best"
