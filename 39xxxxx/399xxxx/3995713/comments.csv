-That spells out ""fucking useless game"""
,SharpieFTW,2008-01-31T09:49Z,"hmm. Seems like this game is also known as ""Space Cowboy"". There's already successful versions out in the public. I don't believe this is a US version since the posters on the forums for the site are from the UK (at least the few I checked), but UK can easily connect to the MY servers if that's in fact where they are hosted. I don't quite know. Is a wicked fun game though once you get to the mid-range to high end of the game."
