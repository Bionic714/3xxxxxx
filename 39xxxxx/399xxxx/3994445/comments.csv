great otherwise"
,jwsonic,2008-01-26T05:47Z,"Good call on the broken archive, it got corrupted somehow. I've obtained another, uncorrupted copy and I'm seeding that. If yours is messed, try redownloading."
,herschel,2008-01-30T02:53Z,"Sorry, don't mean to complain, but I've re-downloaded 3 times now, and #5 is still broken."
