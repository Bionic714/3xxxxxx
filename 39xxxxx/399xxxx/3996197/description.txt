15 CDS AAC    Synopsis
Guilt, sacrifice and redemption in a freezing Derbyshire winter in this tense psychological thriller from the acclaimed author of 'Black Dog'. 'The sun had dropped over the edge of Irontongue Hill so that the snow-covered moor was in shadow ! but Marie Tennent would never see the dawn.' Marie's was not the only body lying undiscovered under the Peak District snow that January morning - nor the first. In 1945, the wreckage of a bomber was found on the Hill, full of dead crewmen. The missing pilot was declared responsible, but why would a decorated hero desert? The only other survivor refuses to talk. A young Canadian woman has arrived to uncover the truth - the pilot was her grandfather. DC Ben Cooper is intrigued. Perhaps he can help? To his boss DS Fry, investigating two frozen bodies found on the moors, her colleague's interest is entirely unprofessional. But the past has a way of influencing the present and before either knows it, a long-cold trail in the dead of winter has grown dangerously hot !
