Anyone want singles 2 cheats? (some also work for singles one)

Extra Money
First, go to properties of the following file: C:\Program Files\Singles2\config\game.cfg and take out the read-only attribute. Before you start a new game, go to your installed singles folder, then to the ""config"" folder, and find ""game.cfg"" file. Make a backup first, then select the file properties and take out the read-only attribute. Search for ""money"" and change the values to as high as 999999. These are the default values:

moneyEmptyScene = 100000
moneyStartStory = 496
moneyStartBackyard = 2500
moneyStartApartment = 5000
moneyStartPenthouse = 10000

Save the changes, edit the properties (make the file read-only again), and start the game.

Unlock all modes
Use the method described above to edit game.cfg file. Look for BackyardEnabled = false, ApartmentEnabled = true, PenthouseEnabled = false and change the false for true and you are set.

Uncensored version
Use the method described above to edit game.cfg file. Search for ""pixelation"" then, and make sure that pixelate = true, and that fullPixelation = false. This works for the international game version."

Then right click the the icon again in the Singles 2 folder, and Create shortcut>desktop.

,shahmatt,2008-04-12T12:34Z,"Hi. Thanks for your response in the Singles - Flirt up your life thread. I actually downloaded this torrent instead and I made a mistake by posting in the other thread. Sorry!

Anyway, regarding the Booster, it does not work for me. Let me explain how I went about installing it:

I first patched my version to 1.1 (which upgrades the program to recognize the  Extensions folder). I then installed Booster v2.4 created by Steffi1964 (This I got from a link I found in the official website forum). Does not work! I patched it to 1.2, and 1.4 and tried with these patches also,  and still no luck. I think the core problem is that the program does NOT detect the Extensions folder, because it won't recognize any plugin I place there. Basically, I think the 1.1 patch does not upgrade your version correctly. Any suggestions on what I can do?"
,shahmatt,2008-04-12T12:42Z,"In addition to the above comment. I did install into my C drive. I did do clean reinstalls to see if it makes a difference, this included using the patch setup files to uninstall existing versions, and sometimes searching the registry for leftover bits.... 

Thanks for your help in advance.."
,vegeta71,2008-05-05T05:09Z,"hey i'm having a problem with the language of this game, does anyone know how to change it to english, its set on portaguse, i don't mean the full game language i mean  the voices of the characters, how do i change it to english?

,ExiledKlown,2008-10-21T08:40Z,"Hey, I downloaded the first Singles game and it worked out great and everything (and thanks for putting it out there :]), but when I downloaded this one, pasted the crack into the correct spot (I think!), I get this error code: An error occurred when initializing DirectX (Library ""d3dx9_24.dll"" not found). Please install DirectX9c February 2005 update from CD.
Grrr. Now what do I do? Thanks."
,freakabee,2008-11-17T04:04Z,"ExiledKlown, and others who have this problem, I had it too. It basically tells you what to do in the error message, and I tried it and that worked fine for me.

You just go to the folder that you downloaded with this torrent (not the folder you installed the game into) and you will see a DirectX folder inside of it. Open that, and run DXSETUP.exe that you find inside the DirectX folder.

Install it, and you'll probably have to restart your computer for the updates to take effect, but after that it should work fine. It did for me at least, and I was getting the same exact error you have.

Hope this helped ya"
,deviousl15,2008-12-14T15:55Z,hey can u seed it its stuck on 75% thankx
,ExiledKlown,2008-12-16T06:47Z,Thanks freakabee for the help. I ran DXSETUP.exe and I didn't even need to restart. I clicked my game and it immediately started! So happy. Thanks for the help and thanks EmoxChick for the sweet torrent. ^^
,ExiledKlown,2008-12-17T04:57Z,I'm getting more help here with the game then anywhere else I see. I'm back to ask how to I get the Booster to work with this game? The game version says 1.0 but I try to update and it says it successfully updated but the game still says 1.0. Can somebody help me please? Thanks.

,Michelk,2010-01-14T11:18Z,"hanniie :)

""StarForce"" is a software copy
protection system designed to stop people from making and playing pirated
games. When you install a game on your computer that uses StarForce,
StarForce is automatically installed with no user agreement or mention in
the game's EULA. There is an official removal tool available that will remove the StarForce drivers permenantly. get it from the following link:

,mrqnr,2012-07-01T12:35Z,"redwytche: ""skip the crack and instead install patches 1.2 and 1.4""
Yes. This is true.

But there is another problem. Its description and solution are here: http://forum.deepsilver.com/forum/showthread.php/67022-Solution-found!-Singles-2-patch-1-4-and-StarForce

The installer of the patch 1.4 has a bug. It does not copy the file Singles2.exe. It copies only two other text files from the patch to the game folder.
It is verified. Copy exe file manully to the game folder, as it is described in the solution on the DeepSilver forum.

After this there must appear an inscription on the game screen, that the version is 1.4.

People, who earlier were able to conquer the StarForce after installation of the patch, still were playing in old version of the game. :)"
