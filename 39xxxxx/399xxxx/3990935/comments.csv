I don't think that this official release do it justice; there's hardly any introductions and some of the medleys are recorded from several places and put together (Afterglow originally was part of the first medley) and you can hear when they switch concert.....that's not good.

The best recording I've heard from their 2007 tour was their concert in Berlin, it even beats the one in Rome :P

And if you have 3 Sides Live and The Way We Walk, this is really not going to compete with those.
Nice up anyway, appreciate the FLAC format. :)"
