,Hubird,2008-06-09T04:59Z,"The albums:

Grand National
&
John Butler 

Are VERY poor quality and only 128kbs. Do not bother download them. The others are all 192. "
,Hubird,2008-06-09T05:27Z,"Album ""Sunrise Over Sea"" is missing track 13 - Sometimes

The two live albums:


Live at St. Gallen is 2 discs but the creator of this torrent was lazy and mixed both discs together.

Living 2001-2002 is also 2 discs and both disc are also mixed together in the same folder.

No track numbers are present in the file names to easily distinguish between them.

I don't mean to sound ungrateful but if you are going to do something, do it properly."
