,foreveralone,2009-03-30T10:32Z,"for get what i said the xbox emu installer is a trojan

if i didnt have avast i would be skrewed right now when i extracted the xbox installer my explorer.exe froze and olny it froze and my cpu usage jumped to 100% on my dual core and the dwm.exe jumped to 64% (causeing the 100%) so i had to shut down dwm with task manager and in the ooo 5 secounds before dwm restarts i had to delete the whole folder and empty my recycle bin and i know its a trojan because avast olny flaged the xbox emu installer none of the other emu installers were flagged 
i think this guy/girl should go burn in F***ing hell
i reccoumend a imidiate ban"
