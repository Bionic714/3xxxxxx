,NisseP,2008-01-24T22:01Z,"wow... could be interesting to hear ... is this some kind of brain-washing material ""how to brainwash"" ??"
,NisseP,2008-01-24T22:08Z,"btw..... many many years ago i attended a ""first introduction"" to the Scientology Church.. They gave a lecture about secrets in the subconcousness and made me think i actually could get in touch with stuff like that. Me and a friend (who got in a bit deeper than me) went there a few times after the introduction... In the beginning they gave the ""courses"" for free... and i started to think that this is very odd courses they give - i don't believe this... (among the stuff we made was this ""bull baiting"" - where you are supposed to sit and tease and annoy one other person and try to find out their ""bad"" spots. They said that when the other person starts to laugh or get angry - then you touched their bad spot.... That a shit!... So if it told the other person that they played with dolls when they sat on the toilet and masturbated - and they maybe laughed because they thought it was to stupid... that was supposed to actually be true - because they laughed... no way!
Well.. it ended up like this... they told me (and my friend) that the next class we should take would cost money and i hate stuff that cost money - at least when i hardly have any at all.. and if something like this should cost.. i don't like that..so i quit... I manange to tell my friend to quit too and she did... even if she was in a bit deeper.. 
The idiots from the S. church phone a couple of times but i never went there again... Even 10-15 years after they sent letters and tried to contact me again... do they never give up..."

^ Great Scientology E-book archive, including FULL COURSES, and interviewer direction. 

The bad part of Scientology its its love of copywrights and money, Most of its supporters are good people who believe they are helping the world. Props to any mid-low lvl members of the Sea org. "
