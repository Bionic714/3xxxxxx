Please go to http://www.ipodtouchfans.com/forums/showthread.php?t=30044 for Directions etc on how to use this Jailbreak..

This Jailbreak will give you all the Apps + "Wobbly Icons"
Thanks to koog for the original version of this method!

-----------
Using this method you can update your 1.1.1/1.1.2 jailbroken iPod Touch to a 1.1.3 Jailbroken iPod Touch WITHOUT USING IBRICKR, with NO GLITCHES and ALL THE NEW APPLE APPLICATIONS AND FEATURES ENABLED.

Follow those simple steps to get a jailbroken iPod Touch 1.1.3. This method has been tested and found to work. Works on Mac and Windows!


STUFF TO HAVE:
MAKE SURE YOUR IPOD IS JAILBROKEN AND IS RUNNING SSHD AND AN FTP DAEMON.
MAKE SURE YOU CAN ACCESS YOUR IPOD VIA SSH AND FTP.
You can use SCP instead of FTP if you wish.

DRAWBACKS:
THIS METHOD WILL DELETE ALL APPS YOU HAD INSTALLED BEFORE ON YOUR IPOD EXCEPT FOR INSTALLER (You can easily reinstall them later).
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY ANYTHING YOU PURCHASED OFF THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE ON YOUR 1.1.3 JAILBROKEN IPOD.
