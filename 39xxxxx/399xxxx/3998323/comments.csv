,Beton123,2008-07-22T06:19Z,"When some asks you if the blow job that they have just giving you was good, They already know something is wrong. 

burn lazy cunt you, tell the folks where you lived before I found you and tell them about Anthony, your new to become parole officer and how you fuched up this crack, before I have to .

A simple opening of the mouth can expose and tell the world that you are ready for some dick  and recognition but you were expecting only the fame.

In other words, this is a lobbying effort. Us , as the party of Normal Democrats need you to contribute.

Think about your contribution and we will keep in touch."
,Triple_6,2008-09-19T23:53Z,Thanks.
,bluemamoo,2008-10-28T03:48Z,"Loaded without a hitch, didn't even insert mach1lic.dat like your readme said to ...kind of afraid to now, seeing as how it is working.

What does mach1lic.dat do anyway?

Thanks again for the gread upload, i'll make sure to seed it."
,wg020459,2009-01-02T18:12Z,"I'm new to ""Torrenting"". I just downloaded this - what do I do to de-compress or open it. I've never seen .rar"
,dazzamatazz,2009-03-13T19:28Z,Download the latest version from Artsoft and use the licence from this torrent. All works fine and using code with over 1500 lines. Note some of the wizards will not work the licence wont let you.
,brcguy,2009-04-08T04:03Z,"Hey Burn420, Thanks for this.  I have been searching for Aspire from Vectric Software, or VCarve (or any vectric software at all)  Can you help with that?  Please and thanks.  And thanks again for this!"
,Astor123,2009-10-11T00:45Z,"I downloaded the latest 3.0 version from Artsoft and a additional file that makes it work on Vista and used the Licence file from here and it worked just fine, pass 1000 lines of code, on my desktop.

When I tried the same on my laptop running XP it only gave me 500 lines of code.

Anyone know why?"
,BlacklineVW,2009-11-01T00:52Z,"got the same thing as Astor12, over a 2000 en more on my laptop, and on my desktop with windows xp only 500  lines of code

sorry about my engel, i am dutch hahaha

lAnyone"
,1JRH,2009-11-29T16:01Z,"Per Artsoft's website, laptops don't work because...    * (Laptops are not supported because the power saving features of the chipsets disrupt the pulse stream)
"
,1JRH,2009-11-29T16:04Z,"*You must use a Desktop PC if you are using the Mach3 Parallel Port Driver. Laptops are not supported because the power saving features of the chipsets disrupt the pulse stream. Mach3 will only be supported on laptops running an external motion controller, such as one of those found on the Plugins page.*"
,1JRH,2009-11-29T16:13Z,Does anyone know if this will run under 64 bit Windows-7? Their Mach 3 Vista patch says 32 bit.
,Astor123,2009-12-07T02:22Z,"1JRH

You didn't understand what I have said. 

The crack DOES NOT work on Windows XP with the lates version of Mach3 that can be downloaded from their site. 

I have an older laptop that has a parallel port and it has no power saving features on the chipsets to disrupt the pulse stream. Even if it was a newer model laptop that power saving crap can be turned off.

I even tested it on a Desktop PC running windows XP and the first file loaded would go pass the 500 lines of code but when I loaded another file it would bet stuck on 500th line, wierd."
,pupuhd,2010-01-30T01:05Z,"Excellent, thank you."
,rhinobenz,2010-12-07T22:42Z,"anyone have the latest version of MACH3 (v2.63)?

thanks guys"
,_mune,2010-12-09T13:02Z,Thank you. This is just what I have been looking for to test my knowledge of programming. I am a noob and I will remain so unless I do some actual programming. Math Rocks!
,varis74,2010-12-19T21:42Z,thanks for all. have you done with aspire from vectric?
,mmckee81,2011-02-10T17:22Z,Mach 3 does not work on 64bit systems
