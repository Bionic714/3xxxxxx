These tracks have been sampled from the orginal singles. Inevitably there are scratches, pops, some crackle, etc. although I have tried to clean them up as best I can.

All tracks originally sampled at 44KHz, 16-bit stereo. "De-clicked" using Brian Davies' "ClickRepair" version 2.21. Saved as 320kb/s CBR MP3 using LAME.

Enjoy :)
