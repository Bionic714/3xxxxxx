,blacknamber4eva,2009-03-07T18:12Z,Cheers been looking for this for ages... since playing the demo on Xbox Kotor. :D
,blacknamber4eva,2009-03-21T00:34Z,Stopped working on my softmodded xbox... hangs at the first splash screen. Tried two different burned versions. Not sure why it suddenly stopped though?!?
,triplej057,2010-05-04T13:14Z,"This game is great, but it does have problems on a Soft-Modded XBox.

It loads perfectly when there are NO SAVED PROFILES. But after you load it, and play for a little while, and save a profile and a game it hangs on the start-up screen.

One solution is to delete your save games and profiles for this particular game, then it loads and plays perfectly!!

Maybe someone more knowledgeable can comment, but it seems that it won't load correctly if there are saved games and profiles.

,triplej057,2010-05-04T13:17Z,"Obviously it is not a very playable game if you can't re-load profiles and saved games.

Maybe someone can suggest a work-around? Because it works EVERY TIME when you delete the existing profile and saved game,"
,bongripper,2010-10-07T21:05Z,"any word on a fix for this?

hangs after saving game still."
,noamlol2,2011-07-02T02:50Z,does it work on 360?
