,selflove,2008-02-20T08:22Z,Anyone know the quality of this rip?  Is this really a TV rip that was put onto DVD and then converted to XviD?  Is there a skip at skip 56:42?
,selflove,2008-02-20T22:19Z,This is another TV rip that has a skip at 56:42.
,selflove,2008-02-22T05:42Z,"The skip is at 56:37 for this rip.  A couple of other rips have the skip at the same scene in the video.  I have one rip without any skips but the video quality was about the same quality as this rip.  I got mv4u's ""proper"" rip but that also had the skip, but the quality is much better than all other rips that I have seen."
