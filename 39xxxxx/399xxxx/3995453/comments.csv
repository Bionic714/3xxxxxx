A Jack Jones fan from the late sixties, the seventies were prime time!  Never knew of this album and just ordered it NEW from an Amazon client (LP).  Selections are from the best albums unavailable.  Jack says he owns all rights to ALL his music.  ""A Song For You"", The ones with Susan George, Harbour, The Full Life, so many. Really good stuff, and I Could Have Been a Sailor.  Well done, Earth247.  People should know what an extremely rare treasure you've offered.  256KB not bad.  I needed the best HIFI so ordered.  Man, so much of the best from Jack is unavailable.   "
,Libertywithout,2008-12-05T09:47Z,Placed order of this vinyl (new) but Amazon storefront reported they don't have it.  Was this uploaded from vinyl or CD?  Any chance of a FLAC upload?
