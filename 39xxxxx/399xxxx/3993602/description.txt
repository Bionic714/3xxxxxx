HISTORY OF THE WORLD, PART 1 - 1981

  Mel Brooks lampoon of various historical eras: The Stone Age" (featuring Sid Caesar) offers a nice parody of the "Dawn Of Man" sequence from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968) ? while the brief but hilarious "The Old Testament" sees Brooks himself as Moses accidentally lose a third of God's original 15 Commandments! "The Roman Empire" ? the longest segment ? features Brooks veterans Dom De Luise and Madeleine Kahn, plus a wonderful conclusion involving John Hurt as Jesus Christ. "The Spanish Inquistion" is, again, brief but surely one of the film's highlights with its tastelessly inspired depiction of this infamous period as a Busby Berkeley-ish production number. "The French Revolution" highlights two established presences in Brooks' films, Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman.
