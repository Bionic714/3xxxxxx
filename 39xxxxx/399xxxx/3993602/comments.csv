[T],JayRay,2008-06-11T19:48Z," Excuse the Negative Quality Numbers (at the upper right, just below the title) but we have an Uploader here at PirateBay who gets jealous everytime someone uploads a title he has uploaded, or wants to upload. So to retaliate he starts messing with the Quality numbers. Those numbers are there to help you the Downloader. But he is now making them useless. And mine aren't the only torrents he's messed with.

Thanks:
JayRay"

[T],JayRay,2008-07-23T19:12Z,"lareth2209:

From what I understand, Mel Brooks intended to continue the story up to present time in part 2, but got side tracked. Spaceballs, was actually supposed to be a segment in part 2 but grew into its own movie.

Thanks

,t0rrentialdownp0ur,2009-12-09T00:39Z,Thanks for this great movie.
,teslonelf,2009-12-25T12:19Z,"The reason there is no ""Part II"" is because it was a continuing ""historical joke"" from Mel Brooks.  A sequel was hinted at in a few of his other movies, including 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights' and 'Spaceballs'.  There are also rumors that Mel Brooks put it in the title to stop the numerous and unrelenting question, ""What is your next movie going to be?"".

I have always loved this movie, it is my favorite of all of Mel Brooks movies.  I have yet to finish downloading this copy, but I wore out the VHS copy I had, so it will still be better than what I had.  Thanks for the upload!"
,GimmeGimme416,2010-02-23T15:23Z,Impressive collection of movies you have.  Thanks for this one.  I've seen it several times and still laugh when I see it.
,BinkyDeath,2010-05-12T00:34Z,"I'd heard different versions of why it was called Part 1 - the one I heard most was that History never stops getting made so it was a joke that you could take different ways.
I've heard the other reasons people have already stated here about why this was called Part 1 as well.
There were always rumours there being a Part 2 - but it hasn't been made.

HOWEVER - in 2009 there was info released that stated Part 2 was finally going to be made. Mel's latest directorial role since Dracula, Dead and Loving It in 1995.

Is this true??

Naaaahh.  ;-)  Check the date on the reports if you find these claims people.  They're all dated April the 1st.  If you check out the IMDB page that claims to be Part 2 you get redirected to a film called April Fools Day.  lol

Which makes me wonder - how did the guy who posted above me believe he's seen a film that hasn't been made and that it's not as good as Part 1???  :-S

I'm in the middle of downloading various stuff by Mel so I'm gonna get back to it... enjoy the film guys.  :-)  'Tis a classic! :-)"

,araj80,2012-08-06T18:42Z,whoever seems to think there's a sequel must've been smoking the mighty joint.
