[T],DaRkFib3r,2008-01-26T22:12Z,By the looks of things you still havent learnt how to read either. So don't waste your time commenting..fking looser.
,ROKKETTARO90,2008-01-27T01:38Z,Do you really wanna rip music videos?? please read the mvid scene rules...or please don't say on your nfo that your source is hdtv..because it isn't true!
[T],DaRkFib3r,2008-01-27T10:00Z,"Ended up finding their site and thats all good and well, never knew about it before and by the amount of shit around the net most people havent either. 

I do state they are from HDTV because they are, the quality of Free to air HDTV may not be up to the standards of cable broadcasters in the USA or other countries but it does not change the fact thats it from where it is.

I'm not part of ""the scene"" nor am i in any of there release groups, i only do this because i use these videos myself and thought it be nice to give something back to the community. They may not be up to the standard of the scene, but i keep the quality of the releases consistand and most people who have downloaded my torrents know the level of quality they expect."
[T],DaRkFib3r,2008-01-27T10:35Z,"I'm happy to get some constructive feedback rather than ""your files are only shits"" which does not really give any details to your issue or any suggestions to improve the releases.

In the end people wouldn't seed my torrents if they didnt like them; which they are. So i must be doing something right."

 I think your videos are soooo GREAT and I always wait for you to put them on the site...
Great quality and good size better than DVDRips....
 And also I suggest that you should crop the 4:3 videos so we can watch them in full screen, for example britney's video ""piece of me"" should be cropped from the right and the left to look better....
I've spoken sooo much! Again THANKS for your great and hard work and for bringing to us the best :) !

(And Ignore the bad comments because they're just assh*les!)"
[T],DaRkFib3r,2008-01-28T04:12Z,"""4:3 videos so we can watch them in full screen, for example britney's video ""piece of me"" should be cropped from the right and the left to look better....""

Yep will be doing that soon with new releases, looking at using some better software as i'm having issues keeping the correct aspect ratio with the stuff i'm using atm."
,laith_omnea,2008-01-28T13:05Z,"OK DaRkFib3r :)
Thanks for everything... Keep it up!
YOU'RE THE BEST! :)"
,_Wintermute_,2008-01-29T14:17Z,"Thanks DaRkFib3r! Keep up the good work, and keep 'em comin!"
,scandalous2005,2008-01-30T05:01Z,"Great job man!  I just want to tell you, forget about these assholes.  No matter what you do, there will always be someone hating you for what you're doing, no matter how good you are.

Keep them coming!  (Like Timbaland's ""Scream"")"
,coldtear,2008-02-01T16:39Z,"Dont crop to 4:3...
