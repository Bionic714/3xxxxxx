,tonneke65,2008-01-26T06:32Z,still looking for a version with dutch subs
,korbiekwan,2008-01-26T09:14Z,"Good Luck with those ""Dutch subs"". This is a DVDscreener, made for award consideration. If you need/want subtitles, you will have to wait until this film is released (or in the torrent world, close to it) to retail DVD...or...someone with too much time on their hands makes a custom version from this rip.
This is an excellent copy. Downloaded it from another site, burned it, watched it, it's outstanding quality.
Hope that helps."

,permand30,2008-01-29T16:09Z,"Nogen der ved om den er kommet med dansk tekst? Hvorfor ikke lægge ud med Dansk,svensk,norsk og finsk.? Er jo flest brugere her fra skandinavien. Ville være rart! På forhånd tak. Hvordan laver man et upload?"
,glosss,2008-01-29T18:13Z,kvalite?
,isjcinu,2008-01-30T19:59Z,This file won't play with VLC am I doing something wrong?
,Thengol,2008-01-31T16:57Z,"TY Team FCR, looking forward to more from you. "
,Thengol,2008-01-31T16:58Z,"To Isjcinu: Haven't gotten it downloaded yet, but this is most lightly a mirror of a DVD-R, which means you have to have a program like Daemon tools to read it, or Nero to just simply burn it straight to a DVD-R. 
"
,Thengol,2008-01-31T17:03Z,"One more thing: Remember to share! Upload for a while...will make everyone happy, except Hollywood. "
,isjcinu,2008-02-01T00:38Z,Thanks Thingol. I do have Nero I'll try that!
,Thengol,2008-02-01T05:25Z,"Thxs to Himod, nice quality, just mount image and burn! Easy! Good movie too"
