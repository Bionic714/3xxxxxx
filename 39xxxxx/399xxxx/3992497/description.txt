                         -------HOW TO INSTALL------

          
            


1. After downloading everything, open daemon tools.exe and install it(you may need to restart your pc)

2. Now that daemon tools is there, right click in the icon(should be at the botton right conner of your screen)
go to virtual cd/dvd ROM => device 0 [x] empty => mount image. Somewhere in the button of this new window 
the files of types are set to - ALL IMAGES -, click on it, scroll down and put it to search for ALL FILES
now look for the torrent folder and double-click in the file COD4MW.mdf it should open or if not look in your new dvd driver(s)
and open it from there.

3. Right at the beginning the game installer will ask for a serial, go get it at http://www.serials.ws/index.php search for call of duty 4. if it ask for punk buster its ok, if its there or not it wont affect anything, you can install it if you want. in the end of the installer it will ask if you want to register the game, put no.

4. after the game is fully installed run the 1.4 patch from the torrent.
then to keep updating download and run the 1.6: 
http://files.filefront.com/Call+of+Duty+4+Modern+Warfare+v16+Patch/;10492517;/fileinfo.html
then the 1.7: 
http://files.filefront.com/Call+of+Duty+4+Modern+Warfare+v17+Patch/;10829906;/fileinfo.html
After that COPY the iw3sp.exe from the crack folder to the game folder replacing the original iw3sp.exe from the patches. FORGET ALL THE OTHER FILES, i found a better way to make this game work without hamachi.

5.Download xfire:  http://www.xfire.com/download/now/ create an account and sing in.

6. Almost done, now go to epcgaming and look for call of duty 4 cracked servers. TRUST ME YOU WANT TO BOOKMARK THIS PAGE. then look for a link to register.

7. All you have to do now is click the xfire icon next to the server name you want to join and start playing!!!
