Thanks for providing yours by the way :)"
,psdude,2008-01-26T02:49Z,"oh almost forgot saying:
 1. Daemon tools wont find COD4MW.mdf unless you look for it in all file types.

2. While installing COD the installer will ask if you want to install punk buster, do not install it. it will just bother you in a further step.

3. when iw3ps gets damaged copy and paste the one from the torrent *do not move it* it may get damage several times during your first time running the game."

you said you cant find COd4.mdf with daemon tools maybe because you are not searching with all files, there is not need to use other software just daemon."

help..."
,psdude,2008-01-31T17:28Z,"Re: str8loco21 

you didnt read the the hamachi multiplayer README?????

someone in the other side of the network you are in has to be hosting the server or in other words.. running the dedicated server.

if this is not the case then the game wont connect. 

thats why you have to go add a new favorite with the ip of the host pc. right now im hosting a game of 10 people i see no more people are trying to play in the multiplayer..."

Tnx for this torrent but I can't play online.

I've installed DAEMON Tools, and mounted the mdf-file. I installed the game (without Punkbuster). I copied the crack over the original exe-file. I copied the shortcuts to my desk. I installed the patch 1.4. I copied also iw3mpHAMACHI 1.4.exe to the right folder. Then I installed HAMACHI and joined several servers I read in this topic. 

But when I want to join a server in the game, the  serverlist is complete empty. I've also tried to add several servers by IP-adress, but I can't connect to them (I see a question mark symbol before the IP-adress of these servers).


What am I doing wrong? 

Tnx for help!
