Outrageous Fortune is one of New Zealand's top dramas. The Wests are a one-family crime wave with a proud tradition in thievery, larceny and petty crime, until now. When patriarch Wolfgang West is sentenced to four years in jail, his wife Cheryl decides enough is enough; the family are cleaning up their act and going straight. Can the Wests live up to Cheryl's resolve and stay out of crime? It's not easy to be a saint when you have the DNA of a sinner.

Outrageous Fortune follows one cheerfully trashy crime family's attempts to stay out of trouble: matriarch Cheryl, determined to save her brood from following in their father's footsteps, eldest son Jethro, an ambitious lawyer-to-be with a few secrets, Jethro's twin Van (identical except in the brains department) who only wants to be like his dad, 18-year-old Pascalle, who wants to be Rachel Hunter, 15-year-old movie buff Loretta, who is blackmailing her teacher, and Grandpa Ted, who may have Alzheimer's - unless he's just playing it up to annoy people.

Then there's Detective Sergeant Wayne Judd, the West family nemesis; the Hongs, a wealthy Asian family who may or may not have Triad connections, Caroline Darling, Loretta's deputy principal, who has been having an affair with Jethro since he was a 15-year-old student, Munter, Van's best mate and partner in crime, and Wolf himself, who does not intend to take his wife's sudden wave of righteousness lying down.

Outrageous Fortune is a family comedy-drama about the wrong sort of people trying to do the right thing when the rewards for going straight are neither immediate nor bountiful. Outrageous Fortune is a bold, fresh comedy-drama which is by turns bawdy, action-packed, satirical and trashy - but only ever a heartbeat away from reality.
