I was actually looking for Kullervo (can you believe, this is the only torrent in the 'Net which has Kullervo). Found it, and it's a great version. Thank you, thank you!

Reg some of the tone poems... esp Pohjola's Daughter: some instruments seem to be absent... I cannot explain why the strong trumpets don't even squeal! Apart from that, the others all are very good. 

Great collection, thanks for sharing. At 192 kbps, good quality too."
