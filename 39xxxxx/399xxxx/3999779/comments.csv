French & spanish are widely spoken round the world, unlike finnish. The difference between you and us is that we don't need another language to communicate with the world..."
,nasutin,2008-01-29T17:49Z,So why did you wrote in english if you donÂ´t need another language?

I donÂ´t like the qualitygrading... I just tried and clicked on the plus, just to see what happened so count one plus off, because of my curiosity...
