ArtyTorrent Music Production Pack 28-Oneshots-Ride Cymbal-WAV samples 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my sixth pack of drum and percussion oneshots. (Kicks, snares, hi-hats, claps and crashes already posted). More percussion hits to follow.
Included here are 126 ride cymbal samples for use in dance music production.

All samples are 44KHz normalized and trimmed WAVs (some featuring stereo reverb) for use with all major samplers and sequencers. 
Programs for FL Studio's DirectWave sampler are additionally included for users of that app. UnRAR the dwp programs into a directory containing the multiple sample folders to load them up.

These ride cymbals are from the following sample libraries:

Chicago Fire - Deep House, Drum n' Bass and Old School.
Vengeance Essential Club Sounds 1.
Vengeance Essential Club Sounds 2.
Vengeance Essential Electro.
Vengeance Essential House 1.
Vengeance Minimal House 1.

Check thepiratebay.org for more music production packs in the future.
