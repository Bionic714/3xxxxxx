,r0tt3n,2008-01-24T06:11Z,"Well, the scene... if you don't know what that is, then you probably shouldn't know... and a non-scene rip is a rip of a movie that didn't come from any group recognized by the scene, and proper means something was corrected about it.  So, it means it's an unofficial correction to an unofficial rip.  Hope that clarifies things.... slightly..."
