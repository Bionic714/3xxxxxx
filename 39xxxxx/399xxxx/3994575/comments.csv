I just got myself Mick (Simply Red) Hucknall's ""Tribute to Bobby"" Bland & I was very surprised
contrary to some critics I thought this would be a dog....but it actually blew my expectations out the window....I'm so sold on it...great production and vocals & truly Mick owned as the versions are interpretations & growers...check it out as it is up here."
,gjt1462,2008-07-15T08:06Z,"Totall agree with you gazzjazz,old Micky boy does a great job of interpreting Bobby's songs,a fine set of lungs on that boy...who was it that said white boys can't sing the blues...hmm..not me,that's for sure !
Thanks for your BB uploads..superb and great quality @320k..you don't have any more of his work do you ?
Cheers.."
