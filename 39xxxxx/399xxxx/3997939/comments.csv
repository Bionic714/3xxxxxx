,SaraWindy,2008-01-28T12:25Z,"There are more things in haven and erth then in you're wildest thougth's. 
Opan you're mind to the world of possebiletie's, 
but only with a helthy share of sceptesisem.

At least that is my thougth. 
I think that people should be alowed to belive what they want, not what they can prove.
(sorry abot the bad english wrigthing)"
,draguun,2008-01-29T15:09Z,"Definitelly exists ""magick"", not the literally definition you read in dictionary, what humankind thinks as ""heavens""& some use this in their advantage, now is equivocally understand as ""planes"", ""dimensions"" or ""universes"". "
[T],splattergod,2008-02-17T23:38Z,"Very cool collection, indeed.
Alas, for the most part,
Pearls before swine...
but there are some who appreciate the effort, such as myself..
People will continue to argue the merits of magic/k, never realizing it is simply a state of mind...
not actual ""hocus-pocus"".
Perhaps if people actually read, instead of getting information regarding the occult sciences from hysterical religious zealots and hollywood tripe they would not fear it, as much.
People always vilify, fear and attack that which they do not understand.
Have always found it amusing that the same people who deny the existence of magic/k, etc are the same that have no problem believing in the slain and risen fable, believe in an invisible man in the sky, etc...
Cheers"
,RavenTheBlack,2008-06-02T10:25Z,"As the late Crowley once said, "" Magik is the science of tomorrow."" One day when religion and science quit going at each other like bickering children then may find they have a lot of common ground. I only wish a list fo the documents included in the package was listed in the discription. "

,bethmattsix33,2008-08-27T19:20Z,"Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will.

(Illustration: It is my Will to inform the World of certain facts within my knowledge. I therefore take ?magickal weapons?, pen, ink, and paper I write ?incantations??these sentences?in the ?magickal language? ie, that which is understood by the people I wish to instruct I call forth ?spirits?, such as printers, publishers, booksellers and so forth and constrain them to convey my message to those people. The composition and distribution of this book is thus an act of Magick by which I cause Changes to take place in conformity with my Will.)

In one sense Magick may be defined as the name given to Science by the vulgar.-Aliester Crowley"
,Olding72,2008-11-23T11:49Z,"Thank you for this.  I have been searching for a few of these since I was a much younger man.  I have hereto only seen eliphas Levis works as footnotes,  soon I will have some of them.  Thank You.  I've been wanting a few of the Regardie titles as well.  
No Crowley.  Not a great loss, just a flitting thought.   
And again thank you."
,androidslayer,2008-12-19T05:24Z,"Yeah, you totally searched for books on magick just so you could say it's stupid and doesn't exist. Epic loser."
