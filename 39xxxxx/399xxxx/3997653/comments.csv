i heard it was very different, and well worth checking out..."
,SeedsofEvil,2008-09-26T00:22Z,"yeah the directors cut is alot better, it's 116 minutes and basicly all the really juicy fight scenes americas stupid censoring department said had to be taken out, there are two versions the 94 minute version and the 116 minute version, now the original is good but the 116 minute version has a alot more gripping action sequences"
