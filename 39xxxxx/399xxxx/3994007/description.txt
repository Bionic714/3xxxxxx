This is the first release from the small indie company MakeMyDayMusic in Sweden and it contains the debut single "Do what you like (but don't do it here)" with the music collective "Hold your horses, Bob!". The title is said to be a Springsteen quote, but the music is not Springsteenish whatsoever. Rather some experimental Beck Hansen-like rock.

1. Blues for a hip king (mp3@192 kbit/s)
2. Peace is a state of mind (mp3@192 kbit/s)
3. Put a peephole in my brain (mp3@192 kbit/s)

Spread it around, if this is their debut they're bound for some good releases in the future.
