Voliminal: Inside the Nine is a two-disc DVD by the band Slipknot. It was released on December 5, 2006 (December 2 in Australia and United Kingdom). The new 2-disc DVD set features a film on the band over 80 minutes long made by band member Shawn "Clown" Crahan (#6) on Disc 1. The majority of this film is shot on hand held cameras. Disc 2 contains all of the music videos from their album Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses), including the unreleased "Vermilion Pt. 2" video as well as interviews with most of the band members unmasked and other live footage. Lead guitarist Mick Thomson (#7) has stated that this DVD focuses more on the band's days of touring in support of their new album behind the stage and on the road, not just a live show. He said "You will see more of what our days are like," and also that the video "will be like nothing ever before and more funny shit than the last DVD."

The only torrent I could find was on Demonoid, so I bought a copy so I could fix that.  And, you know, so I could watch it myself.
