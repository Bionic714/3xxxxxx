,dapriate,2009-03-29T08:27Z,"Amazing DVD, amazing upload. Greatly appreciated. Jony Boy: You have to mount the dvd with DaemonTools or Alcohol120 or just burn it to dvd."
,KayZ_98,2009-04-28T14:47Z,"can i ask a noob question? why is this iso over 5GB if it's a straight dvdrip, when standard dvds can only store 4.7GB? i had seen this before, is this due to dual layer dvds?"
,samuraibunny,2009-07-03T20:26Z,"Yup, dual-layer."
