,Cabal666,2008-01-28T02:40Z,"Just wanna say the FXG Team, does it right the first time. So count on whatever you download from them is top knotch. I myself have downloaded a few flicks from them, with the recent being 'TRADE', quality was outstanding. So stop doubting there hard work. Now I'm gonna keep it real....all you stupid fuks out there who do doubt the FXG's work, you fail to rememebr one thing....these guys/gals don't ask for nothing in return and it costs you NOTHING...let me say it again, it cost you NOTHING at all to get these flicks whether it's from FXG or anyone else for that matter. So stop the bitchin and negative remarks. It's as simple as this, you either download it or not, the choice is yours. If it's a fake or bad rip, so what???, sooner or later you'll get it. And the best part of all dumb asses...IT'S FUKIN FREE!?
We should be paying these guys, but fuk, if ya had to pay I would hate ta see what you'd be sayin then. I'm happy with my downloads 99% of the flicks I download are perfect, but again, I don't download CAMS! Go figure...lol
FXG YOU ROCK!!! and I appreciate and thank you very much for the flicks. Nuff Said. "
,Lugubrizione,2008-01-28T18:16Z,"dmcintyre, files delivered as *.RAR is very nice. if there's an error during download, u can delete and re-download just that small part instead of the whole movie, image or whatever. Not everyone has a fast connection.

WinRaR is free (well, nag-ware) and there are other alternatives, heck I think even Xp has a built in tool able to handle those files. 

If you are unable to see why it is useful, then go take a basic computer skill class. "

That's to watch on a computer, though, not on TV. You can always recompress it again then to burn on a DVD if that's what you want. Not much quality is lost in recompressing a movie these days.

But, um, wait, isn't this movie in English..? Of course, virtualdub will work with any language subs.

Oh yeah, for some of you out there having problems with sound/picture playback/burning or whatever. Download Divx, you'll get a player and mostly all the codecs in general. But I recommend you also download a 'GOM' player too. Plays everything. Last thing, although downloading the Divx stuff is essential, you must download a AC3filter. 
Divx "
,ExecutionerX,2008-04-25T07:08Z,"Got cut off...
Anyhoo, having these three are great. Even if you just get the Divx stuff and the AC3filter all your movies will play in the windows media player. But with the GOM player I never use WMP. And for a SUPER burner, and I can't stress this enough, get 'CONVERTXTODVD'. Pretty fast converter/burner and even breaks your movie down into chapters like an actual DVD."
