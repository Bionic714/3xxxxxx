When the game becomes a huge success, they, along with a billionaire\\\'s help, form the Professional Baseketball League where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change cities. Coop & Remer\\\'s team, the Milwaukee Beers is the only team standing in the way of major rule changes that the owner of the Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to institute.
