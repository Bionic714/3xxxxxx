That means that your brain evades the submissive, right-wing propaganda that broadcasts 24/7 on every channel.  Support the artists, not the exploiters!  STRIKE STRIKE STRIKE!"

(or not, if your culture isn't into that sorta thing) Art is culture, not marketing! DON'T STOP THE PRESSES! Read, Watch, Listen, Learn, Think! ... now go down to the corner store and buy yourself an ice cold refreshing Coke and a Xavier: Renegade Angel T-Shirt."
,BloodLogic,2008-03-04T04:41Z,"Interesting satire, Zendraloth, and I accept it fully. I'm sure you could satire the key-phrases of Galileo or Locke just as well, in a similar attempt to make the ideas standing behind these words look like nothing but pitches and slogans. Obviously a good introduction to anarchist theory would be the works of Mikhail Bakunin, Alexander Berkman, or Emma Goldman, and not just a three-sentence post made by some anarchist-pirate. And you're right about the activity of socially-conscious individuals being misdirected. They'd rather cooperate with the oppressive system in guaranteeing their means of living, than cooperate with the working class that must fight a social war against the owners of the factories, the banks, the factories, and the farms. After all, the point of uploading and massively distributing these files is two-fold: (a) to promote anarchist theory as expressed in the .HTML document pamphlet that comes with every torrent, and (b) to have a degenerative effect on the income of the capitalist class as a whole. As long as you don't pay for it in a store, that means the deathsquads of thirdworld dictatorships will lose some of their salary, and the armies of world powers will have fewer taxes with which to launch invasions of neglected nations (Haiti, Colombia, Venezuela, Burma, Cuba, etc., etc.). Abolish state and capitalist power. Isolated authority anywhere is a threat to liberty everywhere."
,loopholezero,2008-06-21T16:15Z,"i don't really appreciate the use of filesharing to promote political bullshit, or any other bullshit,for that matter. it's no better than inserting in the torrent .url files linking to porn sites.  it's spam, basically.

maybe what you're trying to push here is all good, but the means by which you do this undermine the message.

that being said, thanks for the torrent, bloodlogic :)"
,BloodLogic,2008-07-12T13:42Z,"The ads of thepiratebay are javascript-based, meaning they're CPU-heavy, some of them have annoying and loud audio, and many of them seem to link to sites that only want to screw you out of time and/or money. But the ads of thepiratebay are what sustain and feed it. Without them, they wouldn't be able to afford servers or support them for all the time they've offered.

Anarchism and the Social Revolution are what sustain me. Without the eight-hour day, freedom of speech, the right to unionize, or a political philosophy that fully explains the actions and motives of all social forces, or any of the other countless achievements of revolutionaries then I wouldn't have the will or desire to do get upload torrents with massive quantities of free content. The free culture cannot happen without the free society. While thepiratebay can only live through ads, I can live only through Anarchism.

Thanks for the comment, though, and I hope you enjoy the torrent. There are plenty more where that came from!
