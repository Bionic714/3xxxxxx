Show Notes:
- 'Bloc Party' was over 'Points Of Authority'.
- Chester brought out his son Tyler on 'In The End'
- The band stopped 'Bleed It Out' after the drum solo and sung a birthday song for Rob. After that they continued the song.
- This was the same setlist as the night before, but featured 'Papercut', a fan favorite, being added to the setlist, with 'Valentine's Day' being moved down to after 'Breaking The Habit'. 
- I've been there :)
