originally posted on Mininova using a demonoid tracker;

original post follows:
The Perils of Penelope Pitstop was one of the two spin-offs of Wacky Races. (The other being Dastardly & Muttley in their Flying Machines.) Every episode, The Ant Hill Mob (Clyde, Dum Dum, Softy, Yuk Yuk, Snoozy, Zippy & Pockets) must protect Penelope from 'The Hooded Claw' and his henchmen, The Bully Brothers. 'The Hooded Claw' is really Penelope's guardian (Sylvester Sneekley) in disguise and wants to wipe out Penelope so that he can have her inheritence. This is one of those cartoons in the late 60s and early 70s that were short-lived, but was one of the best spin-offs created by Hanna-Barbera.

All of these were ripped from DVD's rented in Japan. They are all in English, with no subtitles. I ripped the bonus features as well, which include interviews, and various clips thrown together. As with the other two Hanna Barbara series I ripped, I also threw in the Japanese version of the theme song as well [...];

since the tracker can no longer be considered active (it was an old demonoid tracker anyway), i took the liberty of creating a new torrent using TPB one;

it took a very long time for me (and others as well) to download the dvd rips so please seed after downloading;

all credit goes to the one who uploaded this first (unable to find a user name on the mininova site), not me;
