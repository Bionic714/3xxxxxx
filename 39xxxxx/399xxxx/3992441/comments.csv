thnx"
,xj0hnx,2008-03-27T07:26Z,Would have been nice for you to mention that it isn't in english.
,Draelren,2008-04-03T16:18Z,"1) Typically vray is for max.

2) mental ray is separate from vray and they can't be linked.

3) 1.5 is the last version cracked, this is for probably a revision pack.

4. This is not in english."
,thyeon,2010-03-22T04:23Z,"can i use tis also in revit?,.
i prefer 2 use revit than 3d max."
,thyeon,2010-03-22T04:25Z,"do you have a mental ray for revit architecture?,."
,odafos,2011-11-01T18:42Z,Typically it is for Max??? I don't suppose you are aware of its wide application with Cinema 4D. That is what I am looking for AND in English. It would be nice to find one...
