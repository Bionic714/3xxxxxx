these mods are just little snipets anyway, more about quantity than quality here. Remember that adding components could compromise site security, and I don't know how someone would check anything like this for bad code, not like you can scan it with av or check for spyware without acutally looking at the code and know what ur looking at. Anyone have any input in that area? I've heard of some ""free"" templates reporting statistics to other sites without users knowledge, and I dont have grounds to suspect foul play here, but it would be nice to hear from anyone who is knowledgeable about these things."
