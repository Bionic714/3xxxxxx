,Beastilio,2009-01-06T22:18Z,"Remaster sucks, not original. Sharon Osbourne is a B*TCH!

""In 1986, Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake sued Osbourne for unpaid royalties, eventually winning songwriting credits on Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman. The 2002 reissues of these albums are derided by fans due to the replacement of the original bass and drum tracks of Daisley and Kerslake with new ones by Osbourne's then-current drummer Mike Bordin and bassist Robert Trujillo. Fans and critics generally felt the move was dishonest, especially as no indication of the changes appears on the exterior packaging or sleeves of the altered albums (although stickers indicating this were later added.) Osbourne's wife and manager, Sharon, explained the re-recordings in a press conference: ""Because of Daisley and Kerslake's abusive and unjust behaviour, Ozzy wanted to remove them from these recordings. ""We turned a negative into a positive by adding a fresh sound to the original albums."" Daisley and Kerslake deny the allegations of ""abusive behaviour"" and continue to battle for royalties owed them for their work on Blizzard of Ozz."""
