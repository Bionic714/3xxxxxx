This version WILL work with 10.4 and slightly older OS releases.  THIS IS THE OLDER VERISON.  If you like this app enough that you would actually want to PAY for a license, but don't want to put your info into this ""licit"" copy.  Here's a link to this same OLDER version of Delicious Library off of their official website: delicious-monster DOT com/downloads/DeliciousLibrary.dmg
