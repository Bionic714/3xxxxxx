,BloodLogic,2008-02-01T05:10Z,"hey hey hey!!... down in front!...  Okay, yeh, the downloadin' speed isn't so good at this moment, sure, yeh, gotchyeh.  Get this, everything I upload is 100% unpaid for, stolen, and most important, stolen, so it might work for only six hours out of twenty four.  Gimmie a break.  You're getting free movies, and everyone can check my user-profile to see that I've uploaded forty things, each one a complete season or two, and all of them now with plenty of seeders and leachers.  Yeah, and they're all in chronological order, like I finished one before starting another, so come on, deal with it.  You know I'm going to finish it, come hell or high water.  (p.s. the document ""The Libertarian Socialist Revolution"" includes info on how to protect yourself while downloading by using PeerGuardian2 and BlockListManager.)  And oh, by-thy-way, if youwant more television, complete seasons, always at yer service.:)
