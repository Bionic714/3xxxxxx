[A Florentine Films Production] {Subject: History}

"Jazz music objectifies America. It's an art form that can give us a painless way of understanding ourselves. The real power of Jazz and the innovation of Jazz, is that a group of people can come together and create art, improvised art, and can negotiate their agendas with each other. And that negotiation is the art. Bach improvised all the time, and he did improvise, but he never looked at the second viola and said 'Let's play the Ein Feste Burg.' They were not gonna do that. Whereas in Jazz, I could get together, I could go to Milwaukee tomorrow, and there'd be three musicians in a bar at two thirty in the morning. And I'll say, 'What you want to play, man? Let's play some blues.' Well, all four of us are going to start playing. Everyone will start copping and playing and listening. You never know what they're gonna do. So, that's our art. And the four of us can now have a dialogue. We can have a conversation. We can speak to each other in the language of music." -- Wynton Marsalis, First Interview of Episode 1

IMDB Description:
-- Ken Burns's JAZZ is hands down the best documentary I've ever seen on any subject. The history of jazz is of course a rich topic to investigate, but aside from the content, it's the style of production, the seamless editing of source and interview footage, and the way the story is told that make the entire whole nothing short of engrossing.
-- Having just come off a documentary binge, I've noticed several aspects of production that oftentimes drag the program down. Shaky camera work, interviews shot in poorly lit rooms, and premature cuts to irrelevant footage are just a few things that make me want to hit the "stop" button and rub my eyes.
-- JAZZ has none of these faults. It's a crisp production that pays close attention to cuts and voice-overs. It has its own rhythm, where the head shot of the interviewee cuts to a voice-over narration of black and white footage as the source audio is faded up at the right time. You dig?
-- Also, the interview monologues are priceless. What else would you expect from jazz musicians who speak such a mellifluous, easygoing jive that hits on-point every syllable?
