ArtyTorrent Music Production Pack 29-Oneshots-Bass Kick Drum 2-Hip Hop-WAV
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my 7th pack of drum and percussion oneshots. (Kicks, snares, hi-hats, claps, crashes and ride cymbals already posted). More percussion hits to follow.
Included here are 193 kick drum samples for use in hip hop/RnB production (or other genres if you need booming bass drums with a lo-fi sound).

All samples are 44KHz normalized and trimmed WAVs for use with all major samplers and sequencers. 
Programs for FL Studio's DirectWave sampler are additionally included for users of that app. UnRAR the dwp programs into a directory containing the multiple sample folders to load them up.

These bass drums are from the following sample libraries:

Zero-G Hip Hop and RnB.
Sony Acid Street Beats.
Noviss Hip Hop pack.

Check thepiratebay.org for more music production packs in the future.
