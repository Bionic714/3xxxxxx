                  thanx"
,freqazoidiac,2010-08-17T07:45Z,"You upped this in 2008, it has a massive seed swarm, was able to download this within half an hour here, pretty darn good. The quality looks fabulous and this Movie is harder to find intact than I thought it would be. Thanks for offering this, and jesus fucking christ, why does no one give comments like ""THANKS"" ??? TPB should be like demonoid where your seeding is tracked and rated."

 They could implement that at any time and just look at their tracker and kick all the lame-asses who don't seed anything. 
that would probably get rid of any law enforcement agents on the tracker."
