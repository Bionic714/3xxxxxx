Classical acoustic guitar by the Nordic Guitar Quartet. The CD names is Images. The last track contains a recording of a brick being thrown through a church window during the recording. Lots and lots of dynamics there!!!

1-3 Vivaldi, Concerto Grosso op 3 no 8
4-9 Bach, From Orchestral suite no 1 BWV 1066
10 Ravel, Pavane pour une Infante defunte
11-15 Machado, Dancas Populares Brasileiras
16 Brouwer, Cuban Landscape with rain
17-24 Moreno-Torroba, Estampas
25 Extra track, brick being thrown through a church window.

As far as I know, this cd was produced by the Nordic hifi Club, and is no longer available. Therefore I'll make it available here for those who like guitar music, and for those who want a test track with incredible dynamics. Don't turn up the volume too much the first time!

Enjoy!
