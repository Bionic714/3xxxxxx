However, this one has poor audio-quality; extremely low & no sound in the left speaker."
,pirate_guy8,2008-05-30T02:06Z,"seems to not be working for me.
anyone else had this problem?"
,pirate_guy8,2008-05-30T02:16Z,ignore my last comment- its working in VLC. my media player must be broken.
,Snake.Plissken,2008-06-08T23:21Z,The compression is sometimes really too visible.
,Snake.Plissken,2008-06-09T00:27Z,"Don't waste your time with this one, it's not worth it.
I've found another 700MB release (not available on TPB) which is just perfect and way better than this one."
,TooMuch4U,2008-07-08T18:26Z,It's working for me. Both audio and video.
,TooMuch4U,2008-07-08T18:35Z,"Oh, and Finnish subtitles to this version from here:
