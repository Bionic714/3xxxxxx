DVD ripper feature

    The most common DVD protection systems are CSS and Macrovision.

    DeCSS: the original DVD-Video protection (CSS) is to limit copy and illegal distribution of commercial movies (so called Hollywood movies). However you may think, that you can backup some Hollywood movies you already bought so you can have them in your car or on vacation - without risking to be stolen or damaged by sunlight.

    Please pay attention that in some countries you can' t use a DeCSS system so you should not use the DVDx Ultra Edition.

    DeMacrovision: this original Video-Tape protection (Macrovision) was to limit analog and illegal distribution of commercial movies before the DVD era. However it is still present in some DVD movies so DVDx Ultra Edition can remove Macrovision for a nice copy.
