"Dreamer" is proving popular with you Pirates, so I've added this album

"His California Album" features such delightful classics as "This time I'm gone for good", "If loving you is wrong" & "Help me through the day". The latter is a Leon Russell classic.
HCA also features Larry Carlton, Dean Parks, Ernie Watts & Wilton Felder plus Chuck Findley
With such a lineup you would think this is a Steely Dan supersession.
I've included scanned cover art. MP3's @ 256
Enjoy 
Cheers GazzJazz
