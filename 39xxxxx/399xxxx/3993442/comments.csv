,jizn0,2008-07-10T03:13Z,"My advice to every man on the planet:

1) Download this torrent
2) Open the first track on Demonic confidence
3) Follow the instructions

I just finished day 3 of 21, and I'm blown away by the changes I'm noticing in myself. Even if you only did the first exercise, you will notice a change in yourself, so just give it a shot.

Good places to practice are:
- downtown areas with lots of people
- malls
- college campuses

I can't wait for day 4. Good luck!"

,denip1986,2009-06-17T12:37Z,What is wrong with the other person's speaking?! He sounds like he's heavily retarded (or drunk).
,curlykale,2009-09-06T01:04Z,"Don't download, this is a spoof and not at all funny, that's why the 'BOSS' sounds retarded, drunk. Someone has too much time on their hands, making this crap!"
