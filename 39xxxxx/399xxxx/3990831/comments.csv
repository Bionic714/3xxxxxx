,Reveirg,2008-03-09T17:20Z,Is this compatible with Windows Vista? Thanks
,dartb,2008-04-14T00:36Z,"@ Reveirg:

I think this is just a collection of VSTs, so if you install it into the VST directory of your sequencing program (Cubase, Sonar, Reason, Ableton Live etc.) it'll run fine.

Be careful with Cubase (SX3) on Vista, though.  It just fucked up my installation."
,BIF92,2008-06-26T10:50Z,Oh!!! Thanks You!!!! + to you:)

THANK YOU!"
,fokuzx3,2008-12-20T04:38Z,"the auto tuning program on this is far superior to auto tune 4, worth the download alone.  be prepared to take time in learning these vsts, not exactly newb friendly but worth it."
,dopemcee,2009-01-14T20:50Z,"hey thanks very much for this torrent but i keep getting problems.

,goldenglaze,2009-03-28T19:24Z,"i found the solution to my and dopemecee's issue!!!!!!!! it is vista concerned.
i had some shells loaded but not the ones i needed (5.0 & 5.2)
this is what you have to do:
-go to regedit
-find HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Filter
- right click on the folder and click PERMISSIONS
- then u have to allow the authorizations, also u may try to go on advanced-owner and change the owner...i did both of these but i dont know what made everything work 

now you can enjoy this fucking fine AIR release worth 12000$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

,RasPirate,2009-08-17T06:12Z,"Hey guys ~ I just DL'ed this but Id like to hear from anyone else who has recently installed this on Vista befroe I do.

The download came really fast but I guess Im not used to pre cracked software/torrents so Im a bit shy about this . Any mention of ""regedit"" makes me fidget.

Hows this working for anyone?"
,TacoSteve,2009-09-17T00:22Z,no Maserati plugins or GTR3 Bass Amp plugins? Or did i just not install this right?

Anyone able to help?"
,Daybit,2009-11-02T13:07Z,"Hey guys,
to those having troubles in protools with the ""Select Waves Vocal Bundle Plugin folder"" notification this is what you do. go to the drive you installed waves into, i.e ""c:"", then go to program files/waves and rename the wavesshells folder to ""Waves Vocal Bundle Plugins"", case sensitive... then find and select this folder in protools. "
,RasPirate,2009-11-18T22:10Z,"Works fine in Adobe Audition. Perfectly actually, no probs at all. Thanks, uploader :)

On first look, as a VST, Ozone 4 and/or T-Racks will give you just as bumpin' of a final mix. Nothing jumps out as worth the uber-$$$ they charge for this program however. For simplicity's sake, I'd go with the other VST's I mention above. "

,chonuts,2010-01-02T08:54Z,"For those of you having problems with Waveshells and DAE 5.0.3 hanging/crashing, it's probably a conflict between multiple shells.

To fix the problem, I went to C:\Program Files\Common Files\Digidesign\DAE\Plug-Ins  and deleted the Waveshell files that were either crashing Pro Tools or causing it load really slowly. In my case, I deleted 5.0.3, 5.2, and 5.3 both the dpm and rsr files. I left Waveshells DX 5.7 and now Pro Tools opens lightning fast with no problems.

I also had to delete the same files from C:\Program Files\Waves\Waveshells. I deleted 5.0.3, 5.2, and 5.3 from this directory also. I read somewhere that there is a conflict between these two directories when Pro Tools launches, and deleting these shell files worked for me.

Good luck!"

,paidpirate,2010-10-05T21:47Z,"Party People!.. I feel your pain and I am happy to share the FINAL SOLUTION.  :)  If you're getting ""plug-ins not found"", Waveshell 5.0- 5.2 missing, etc.etc;  first uninstall waves.(optionally use a good registry cleaner like ""Ccleaner"". (yes, it's free) to clear your registry. Then...go to  Control Panel>User Accounts>Change User Account Settings.. Here you bring the slider all the way down to Never Notify.. ( WHY? you ask? Well, The Account Control prevents any program from accessing folders without user permission, even though Waveshell  was able to locate the plug-ins folder, it was not able access it). Cick OK, then restart your computer. Right-click the Waves setup.exe and select ""Run As Admin.. After installation you should see the pop-up box asking to select your plug-in folder. Do so. Whenever you Start your DAW., again right-click> Run As Admin.  This should remedy all related problems.. Hope this helps..   TRUE LOVE, People..."
,lepoulpyz,2010-10-22T09:01Z,"Hi there,
It works fine (cubase 5.1 + windows-7-64bit)

In my first installation i missed 70% of plugins! 
I came here to find a solution, and tryed all what i found here :)
So now I cant say which solution is the good one because i tryed many things, but let me tell you what i did.

- First I uninstalled all plugin and my sequencer too (cuabse 5.1 halion) 
- then used ""Ccleaner"" to clean registery
- I have turned off UAC (""go to Control Panel>User Accounts>Change User Account Settings.. Here you bring the slider bar down to Never Notify"")
- (i think it will do the same but i did this too) i have gone to regedit to find HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Filter. ""right click on the folder and click PERMISSIONS"" then allow the authorisations, then go on advanced-owner and changed the owner).
- I restarted my comp.
- i installed Cubase with administrator right (""right-click"" Run as Admin).(and not updated the programme)
- i installed plugin with administrator right too, in ""steinberg\vstplugins\cubase 5\vstplugins"" "
