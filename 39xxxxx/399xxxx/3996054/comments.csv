,skycracker,2008-01-27T12:50Z,What sequence of installation did you use?
,skycracker,2008-01-27T12:51Z,Update to1.02 before or after installing the expansion pack?
,svensk_huvudverk,2008-01-27T15:56Z,"update after install, you can't do wrong"
,-LonelyWolf-,2008-01-28T14:42Z,How can I patch flaming Cliffs to 1.12b ?
,skycracker,2008-01-28T18:53Z,"Updating to 1.02 not only removes starforce, but also cripples the game. All you get is a ""1.02+"" version, but you can't fly the Su25T FC campaigns, training missions are messed up and you get random PC crashes all over."
,svensk_huvudverk,2008-01-28T23:35Z,"ok. i have not play the full game before so i dont no,, anyone have a serial maybe?? and thanks skycracker for telling"
,svensk_huvudverk,2008-01-29T08:09Z,anyone no any other good jetfight games? im start to get tired of ww2 games
,Msciw,2008-02-05T10:24Z,asking for serial and updating to 1.02 is a bad idea any solutions?
