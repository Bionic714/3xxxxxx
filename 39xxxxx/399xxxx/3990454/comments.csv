,svantebe,2008-02-09T23:07Z,"Does anybody get this to work? I burned it as an .iso file but in my Business Navigator it says ""Medium cannot be read"". Any clue? "
,curioustom,2008-07-15T19:56Z,"This one is better than the .iso.
It starts showing ""reading navigation data"" in my 120d, but then it stays this way.
Don't try it on DVD-R : I've figured it won't work at all."
,curioustom,2008-07-16T18:59Z,"I wasn't able to make it work :
the screen turns to ""Reading navigation data"", but it stays this way at least for 15 mins (that much I've waited for it).
I've got that on a DVD+R with the lowest possible speed on a verbatim disk."
,corveax,2008-07-17T16:28Z,"ROMANIA IS IN IT?
THX IN ADVANCE "
,curioustom,2008-07-18T11:47Z,"Dunno about Romania (wasn't able to make it work).
Anybody that got it to work please share what media have you used and the speed you've written it with."
