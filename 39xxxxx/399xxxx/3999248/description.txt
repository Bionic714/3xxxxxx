About the Video:

This was copied from my well used VHS to DVD, then ripped using CloneDVD. There\\\'s about 5 to 10 seconds of silence at the beginning - this is normal.
Enjoy, and see you on the river!

About the demo avi:

This is a short clip the producer made available online. Check it out before you download the whole thing.

The Intel 4.1 demo file will look much better if your PC has the drivers to run it.

*  These files use Intel\\\'s Indeo Video Interactive Version 4.3 drivers.  If you don\\\'t have them, your system will report an error that says something like \\\"no suitable decompressor available\\\". 

-----------------
From the Video Producer:

[i]Extreme kayaking on steep creeks and rivers all over North America.  World class freestyle, four first creek descents and outrageous crash n\\\' burns from BJ Johnson, Clay Wright, Katie Nietert, Colby Mackley and Tracy Clapp.

No narrative, just great, kickin\\\' music! [/i]
