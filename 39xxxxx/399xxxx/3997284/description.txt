Episode:	2x01 - Seinfeld Vision

Tina Fey stars, writes, and produces this new workplace comedy that is a behind the scenes look at a frenetic television variety show. Single Liz Lemon is living every comedy writer's dream. She's head writer on a demanding, live TV program in New York City whose life is jolted when a brash new network president interferes with her show and bullies Liz into convincing Tracy Jordan, a wild and unpredictable movie star, to join the cast. Now Liz must manage the unmanageable so that the show -- and her dream -- can go on.
