Klaus Wunderlich. 
For people with musically fine-tuned ears and broad accept of music.


With Hermann Mutschler on drums and Peter Grzeschik on guitar Klaus Wunderlich is well accompanied on his three different organs: Hammond H-100, Lowrey H-25-3 and Wersi W-248-S. In addition he plays synth-bass and percussion.

Bearing the title "Sudamericana vol. 3 - Latin festival" this album is the third in a row with a foolproof name. The contents are latin standards arranged in Klaus' "New Pop Organ Sound".

One of the tracks is the one sampled by "the Avalanches" namely "Let's do the Latin Hustle". Walter Wanderley's version of "Summer Samba" is easily matched and surpassed.
