Gory slasher mayhem from Evil Dead co-writer Scott Spiegel, this claustrophobic thriller is set entirely in a small supermarket, whose owner is preparing to go out of business. This doesn't sit too well with the film's resident maniac, who busily butchers the night crew using the tools of the trade (hooks, axes, knives, power tools and so on). The victims include Spiegel's pal and Evil Dead director Sam Raimi as the butcher-shop buffoon who meets a nasty end on a meat hook; even Raimi's favourite lantern-jawed star Bruce Campbell puts in an eye blink cameo as a brutish cop. The film sports some clever, audacious gore effects from KNB FX Group
