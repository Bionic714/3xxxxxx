Synopsis:
Groucho stars, in this 1940 release, as S. Quentin Quale. The plot involves a fight between the boys and the villain for the deed to land needed by the railroad. The film opens with Groucho conning Harpo and Chico while being conned himself. The climactic train ride is brilliant. (J. Bradley Main).
