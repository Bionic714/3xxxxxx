The Transformers: Evolutions is the title of what is intended to be several comic book miniseries published by IDW Publishing, following the same idea of DC Comics' Elseworlds series. Each series will create a new continuity in a different time era during which the Transformers will exist. In other words, the Transformers can exist at places and at points in time that would not be possible in the current 'IDW-verse'. As of 2007, only one series has been produced: "Hearts of Steel", which is set in the United States during the Industrial Revolution.
