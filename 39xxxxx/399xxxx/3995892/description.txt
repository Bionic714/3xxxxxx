ArtyTorrent Music Production Pack 26-Oneshots-Clap WAV samples 1
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is my fourth pack of drum and percussion oneshots. (Kicks, snares and hi-hats already posted). More percussion hits to follow.
Included here are 413 clap samples for use in dance music production.

All samples are 44KHz normalized and trimmed WAVs for use with all major samplers and sequencers.
Programs for FL Studio's DirectWave sampler are additionally included for users of that app. UnRAR the dwp programs into a directory containing the multiple sample folders to load them up.

These samples are divided into the following categories:

Chicago Fire - Old Skool, Electro, Deep and Progressive House claps.
Vengeance Essential Club Sounds 1.
Vengeance Essential Club Sounds 2.
Vengeance Essential Electro.
