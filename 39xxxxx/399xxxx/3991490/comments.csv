,JasonP27,2009-02-03T01:46Z,"1.) Install Bandstand.
2.) During installation you will be required to give a serial. Open the supplied ""BANDSTAND_KEYGEN.EXE""... you should be on the Serial tab.... click Generate button to Generate a Serial.
3.) After installation, run the Bandstand Registration Tool
4.) Copy your System ID from the Registration tool.
5.) Paste System ID into the Keygen tab of the BANDSTAND_KEYGEN and click Generate.
6.) Go back to the Registration Tool under (2. Authorization) and click Paste from clipboard"

,cockn1pples,2009-12-30T12:04Z,so does this work?? guess ill download and see
,clikaroo,2011-07-14T12:16Z,"@no4162, I know your comment is ancient, but for the benefit of others reading these comments...

 DUH, no doubt it registers as a trojan, most bloody keygens will because the architecture is similar. These warnings are FALSE POSITIVES! Again, duh! 

If you're that much a noob run the bloody thing in a virtual machine emulator. Otherwise simply turn off your antivirus stuff, use as directed and then delete the keygen so your virus software (and you) won't trip out over the obvious. Where's the shaking head smileys PB? :)"
