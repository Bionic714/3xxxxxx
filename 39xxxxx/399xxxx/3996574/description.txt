Rips are from various sources, including 8mm,16mm and VHS.
Some of these episodes have not been viewed for nearly 30 years or more, as only a handful were syndicated. Most were not in very good shape and required a bit of clean up to make them presentable

All of the 4-part episodes were put together into single avi files and the 4 single episodes were left independent.

This listing represents the "supposed" creation order ~ but this is strange given the fact that the "Tricky Trap" single episode was supposedly the sequel to a four-parter later in the same season [From Hopeless To Helpless]. This is, however, the entire 124 episode run.

* ~ a LOT of cleanup work went into this project to even get some of them watchable. So appreciate and Enjoy
