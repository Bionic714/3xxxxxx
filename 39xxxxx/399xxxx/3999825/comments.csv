,Hierophantasmagoria,2008-02-14T08:48Z,"This is quite possibly the worst done, label-wise, discography I've ever downloaded. Good content, horribly presented."
,diganaswapar,2008-03-04T00:35Z,"What the hell is up with people putting torrents into one giant rar? Dudes, 1) rar is a proprietary format that's hard to open under Linux (use 7zip instead if you really need compressed archives) 2) it doesn't compress anything, since mp3s or oggs or whatever you're distributing are already compressed 3) it makes it harder to pick and choose which albums you want to download, so you have to download all the damnn thing at once.

Don't do this. Bittorrent doesn't need no stinkin' rars."
,sandbags,2008-03-27T04:40Z,"rar is only really good for things like splitting a dual layer disc iso into 2 so it will fit on a standard disc. For that it's rad. But yeah, not for music..... "
