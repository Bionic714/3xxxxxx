A really touching and fascinating story,
made entirely by Native Inuits in Canada.
The film has a slow pace and allows itself to build up but the story is gripping and fascinating.
However, I do not recommend this film for those who can not enjoy a good art-house film.

""The telling of an Inuit legend of an evil spirit causing strife in the community and one warrior's endurance and battle of its menace.""

 This film is based on an old Inuit folk tale that is 500 yrs old or more.

 Well worth the watching if you like well made stories, and rich cultural stuff."
