http://imdb.com/title/tt0072662/

alright all you culos out there, I was away from the scene for a long time but look forward to me being very active starting now,    

I always liked Luigi Cozzi, sure he wasn't the next Hitchcock but great at his own particular style,   this one isn't the traditional Giallo who done it,  but I think this movie is definitely a classic of the genre and a must see."
,avicenna,2008-01-28T10:27Z,"wow....one day after 20+ cocksuckers grabbed this great movie and we have 1 seeder left,  fuckin unbelievable,   you fuckin pussy cunts out there need to seed or else!!!   Don't disrespect me like that, I have a lot of great movies in my collection that I'm willing to sacrifice the time and effort to share, all you punk's that dump my torrents   I'll rip all of your shitbags wide open!!!!"
,Mattapooh,2008-01-30T13:04Z,"I'm still seeding this.  I grabbed two of the Naschy DVDs you had up before (no seeders on the Loreley one, unfortunately), so I'm looking forward to whatever else you put up.  Too bad everyone else is being a fucking cunt about seeding your stuff, though."
