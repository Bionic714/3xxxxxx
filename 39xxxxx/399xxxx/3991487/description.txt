These are the BootCamp 2.0-Drivers from Apple including the new 64bit-drivers shipped with the brand new MacPro\'s since january 2008. The torrent contains all files on the leopard-installation disk under Drivers/. the cool new things are in Apple/x64.

It is reported that the 64bit-drivers only work on vista 64bit and not on xp64. sadly there arent\'t any apple support-documents or an official download on the apple-site. so i thought sharing these files would be a good idea.

cheers
