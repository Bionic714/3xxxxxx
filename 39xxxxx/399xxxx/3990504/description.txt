Adobe Reader Lite Extreme - an unofficial, slimmed down version of Adobe Reader. It contains only components necessary for PDF files rendering - and nothing more! It needs much less RAM and it is much faster than the original version of the program (faster than Foxit, on par with Sumatra PDF). Perfect for weaker PCs!

Enjoy!
