
1145 CHESS ENGINES TORRENT
==========================

IF YOU LIKE PLAYING CHESS AGAINST A COMPUTER OR ARE FASCINATED HOW COMPUTERS PLAY
AGAINST EACH OTHER, THEN THIS TORRENT IS FOR YOU! 
I HAVE COLLECTED 1145 ENGINES FROM INTERNET, SOME OF THEM ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND NOW!
ALL CHESS ENGINES COME WITH THEIR LOGO AND OPENINGBOOK.
YOU CAN USE ARENA, SHREDDER, FRITZ OR WHATEVER CHESS PROGRAM TO LOAD THESE ENGINES.
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN CHESS PROGRAMMING, HERE YOU WILL FIND A LOT OF SOURCE CODE.
THERE ARE PROGRAMS IN C, C++, DELPHI, VISUAL BASIC, ADA, JAVA AND ALSO FOR LINUX.
I HAVE INCLUDED A SELFMADE CHESS ENGINE DATABASE IN EXCEL FORMAT (EXCEL 2003 & 2007).

HAVE A LOT OF FUN!
