,spellweaver,2008-01-26T08:33Z,"Well, here we are again, another of that great uk comedy, as promised here is No.2 of the 6.
Hopefully there won't be too much trouble uploading this, although my isp will cap my speeds down to about 2mbps evening time in uk (this is because Richard Branson wants another island, and i refuse to buy it for him).
Anyway, all good comments are welcome, any probs, let me know."

Porridge, A Fine Romance, Goodnight Sweetheart, Vicar of Dibley, Keeping up Appearances, Lovejoy, Darling Buds of May; all completed dvd boxsets, all for sharing, just knowing which to share next."

,spellweaver,2008-01-27T10:32Z,"peeps, i have got to close down for a couple of days, it's 27th Jan today, i'll be back on line Friday 1st Feb, torrents will resume, as they won't be touched in any way, sorry about this."

,Ice1,2008-01-29T00:15Z,"spellweaver-you rule, man!!!Thx again!"
,spellweaver,2008-01-30T20:31Z,"You are all very welcome, glad to be able to upload torrents now (after 2 fluff ups lol), well, i'm in the process of setting up anpther pc, and hope to get it on line, so i can up more than 1 torrent at a time.  If successful, i'll start a new series of something (gotta be a comedy or sci-fi, as these are our favourites).  Meanwhile, i'll get Blackadder 3 ready for uploading, sorry they are rar files, but thought it easier, as it don't take quite so much space on my hard drive.  Keep torrenting all, and thank you for helping me seed.
Mike"
,johnd69,2008-02-03T18:35Z,If you're gonna upload a torrent you could at least SEED IT! :(
,spellweaver,2008-02-05T20:03Z,"It is being seeded, i'm uploading it on 2 pc's.
Don't know why you aren't seeing it, many others are getting it ok.  Only thing i can think of is, Virgin cut my speeds back every night, i'm not awake to see how much by, but both machines are running 24/7.
As this one is on 90%, i'll get No.3 ready for seeding (assuming people still want the complete collection)."
,Pooti,2008-02-05T21:31Z,Of course we want the whole collection.I don`t care if it takes time to download.Keep it up:-)
,johnd69,2008-02-06T13:17Z,"Thanks spellweaver. I'm now seeing a full copy. Love this series, so of course the others would be much appreciated! :D"
,f236ggp,2008-02-24T18:28Z,"any chance of ISO file?
