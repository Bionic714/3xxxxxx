This is my personal collection of emulators that work for me and that I have a lot of fun with, so I thought I\'d share them in torrent form all in one place.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Emulators I found that work 100% are:

* Game Boy Advance

* Nintendo 64

* Playstation 1

* Playstation 2

* Sega (multiplatform)

* SNES

* MAME (Multi Arcade Machine Emulator)

Emulators that are in development but still work pretty well or are worth trying out:

* GameCube

* PSP

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also included are 7zip, the open-source compression/decompression program, and the web installer for DirectX, which most all the emulators require.
