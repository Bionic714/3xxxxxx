,sandrolas,2008-02-08T07:54Z,please somebody seed this torrent im waiting for somebody to come seed it for 5 days please seed it
,hcvang,2008-03-10T23:15Z,"sandrolas, if you've been looking for these cartoons for five years, and you 'really want them alot' then why dont you buy them on DVD?

filesharing is fine, when you cant get the stuff by legal means, but this is just bullshit. The whole series is out on DVD, and it's not expensive either - you got no excuse.

,doaivu999,2008-04-01T21:38Z,"if anyone is willing to seed this, i will seed for a full month, but my upload speed is just 50kbs max, so i will upload this on rapidshare and megaupload if someone is interested..."

,BobPage,2008-08-08T12:32Z,Please seed... I only got 10 % availeble...
,SoheiFox,2008-10-15T21:04Z,"You actually CAN'T get this on DVD anymore, and the original uploader should seed until there's a few permanents at least.  The ""I'm gonna take my ball and go home"" attitude when there's not instantly 80 seeders only hurts the fans of the shows.  It wins you nothing but spite.  And spite is empty."

,snakeprime,2009-04-05T16:15Z,"Guys, this torrent is most likely dead...
I've been downloading for weeks and it's stuck at 70.9%.
It's not even the complete series!
It only has 32 episodes out of the 65.

Episode 6 gets bugged around 7.30 minutes

I just added 2 episodes; 20 & 21
I found these at a different 2p2 and refreshed the torrent. When you get them, the torrent will be stuck at 74.3%
I will only get episodes 21-26 from there from this torrent. that p2p doesn't even have this torrent complete.

What I will do is get the series as complete as I can.
So far I've been able to track down most of the episodes and the only ones I can't find are 36 & 56.

If I can't find episodes 36 & 56 in a week from now, I will upload the torrent as is with episodes 01-65 minus 36 & 56.

If you happen to have episodes 36 & 56, send me a message, make a torrent or anything and I'll add them to make the series complete!"
,cavdex,2009-04-13T12:11Z,"Okay, I'll try to reseed this torrent. I say ""try to"" because my PC crashed just one week ago, and I don't know if it can be fixed. Although I think it can. My cousin will take a look at it today.

I've got 100%, in other words the first 32 episodes of season 1.

BUT... I DO expect other people to take over seeding when they've got 100%. DON'T hit and run, please.

(If you guys don't see a new seeder within 24 hours, it'll mean that my PC can't be fixed, and we're all f*cked.)"
,fhilbert,2009-04-15T00:57Z,someone please help seed  this i'll carry the torch for awhile after i finish i promise. i've been stuck on 82.5% for a few weeks now thanks in advance for any help
,cavdex,2009-04-18T14:01Z,"Okay, the first thing my cousin said when he checked my harddisc was ""Oh, crap!"" so that didn't sounds really positive. But he'll try and copy or clone the disc or something.

Will take some time because he's a very busy guy, but there's still hope the torrent can be recovered from the disc and I can reseed this torrent.

Be patient. I'll keep you guys posted."
,ezboard,2009-07-31T14:12Z,"blah blah blah. I thank the uploader for uploading this, but it doesen't seem to have the same hash as it should.. I'll start upping proper filmation ghostbusters later."
