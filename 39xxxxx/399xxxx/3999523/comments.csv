,dirtdogmcgirt,2008-03-25T05:52Z,"missing Dillinger's ""Irony is a Dead Scene"" but still a great torrent bro."
,WoW-PDIN,2008-03-29T19:46Z,SEED PLEASE I NEED MY PATTON FIX
,jimbolic666,2008-05-12T22:05Z,Irony is a dead scene isnt an essential piece in Mikes music career. If theres something missing its because this isnt a discography consisting of Mike Patton stuff but a Pack. The rest enjoy it.
