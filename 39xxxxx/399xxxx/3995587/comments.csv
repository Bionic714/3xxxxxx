,Momradn,2009-01-24T19:35Z,"For the best video performance, I suggest you use K-Lite Codec Pack (Download: http://filehippo.com/download_klite_mega_codec/). It's an ""All-in-one"" media player with the look of Media Player Classic. It play EVERYTHING! It plays both what VLC play and what it doesn't play. It has a built-in HAALi Media Splitter so that you can watch high-quality HD movies with in ie. mkv format. ;-)
