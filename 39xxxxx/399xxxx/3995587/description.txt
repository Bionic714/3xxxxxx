Geared towards the experienced tournament paintballer, "One with the Gun" provides viewers with over one and a half hours of the skill and training secrets needed to be a world champion. Just some of the techniques featured include:

    * Snap-shooting
    * Running and Gunning

    * Break-out Shooting
    * Physical Training
