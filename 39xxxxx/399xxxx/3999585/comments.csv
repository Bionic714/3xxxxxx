,FLICK_THE_MAGS,2008-02-15T04:43Z,Thanks for this one - The prog works - I have a problem with the elite conversion tools - needing an activation code despite the patch.
,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-04-15T06:51Z,"there is no patch with this.. just the trial app, and full instructions on how to install and apply the patch :-) but no patch.

hmm... program works kinda good, won't play a damn thing on my second (or third) monitor, but hey, it plays music!!! maybe because i don't have... THE PATCH?   oh well, thanks for the upload though bud... good work."
,ngv1956,2008-10-01T19:14Z,"The patch doesn't work on ""vista"" and the key-changer freezes up the system, and on my pc Win-XP when I change the application for the one provided, it freezes up too, any advise?
thanks for the upload."

However, I did, but the company uses USB hardware activation, and this USB dongle needs to be in the computer at all times when using the software. When, like me, the dongle burns in a fire, you're in deep shit.

According to their website they say that if the key is damaged it's not a problem to get a new one. Well, maybe it's not a problem for them, but they charge 150$ for it, on top of the 250$ I actually payed for the damn program to start with.

In other words, don't bother paying for this program or anything else from Tricerasoft, they will screw you over anyway..."
