 Bob Dunlap goes back to the bench to give you hands on instruction on the design and manufacture of coil springs. Now you can make those springs for the odd jobs that always seem to crop up. Obsolete guns can be saved and used again. We'll show you how to figure out the size of the spring you need, how to wind it and how to temper it to get a long lasting professional part.
