,cnc45,2008-01-27T18:14Z,I am sorry but does not work with Vista....i have fatala error....is any idea how fix it this super program ??
,therpandrus,2008-01-27T22:12Z,go to sibelius software home page ... or try using a working super operating system...
,cnc45,2008-01-27T23:59Z,"sorry my friends it is  not working..... I have experience with install software and this not working...somewher is problem......anyway...I installed 4.0 and it is wor well but without sound.
Is possible tahn version 5.0 or 5.1 can use laptop keyboard for compose music without any extra MIDI devices ??"
,cnc45,2008-01-28T00:20Z,"here we go::::f playback doesn't work 

By default, Sibelius assumes that your playback device is General MIDI compatible, which almost all soundcards and many keyboards and sound modules are these days. If you don't know, the easiest way to check is to play back a score containing different instruments. If this doesn't work, it may be that: 
You get no sound at all. This means your soundcard or MIDI device or speakers aren't working or aren't plugged in properly, or that your computer can play back through several devices and it's set to the wrong one.
You get different sounds but they're the wrong instruments:
If the right sounds came out, your device probably obeys the General MIDI standard and your life is going to be all laughter and sunshine from now on
If the wrong sounds came out, you'll have to choose a different sound set to suit that device - see Sound sets above
If your device isn't compatible with any of the supplied sound sets, and you don't want the bother of creating your own sound set (see 4.13 Edit Sound Sets), you'll have to tell Sibelius which sounds to use for each staff - see 4.2 Mixer."
,cnc45,2008-01-28T00:36Z,"I foud!!!   disable kontakt silver player and
use your eg.Microsoft GS wavetable synth and you must clink beside TEST on use----YES and it is working and you have nice sound........"
,therpandrus,2008-01-29T00:26Z,"This update is actually the full program. It's not a patch, it is the whole thing. Uninstall everything before installing it: Sibelius 5.0, Sibelius 4, Kontakt Player, etc. (don't worry about config files)
If you want to get the sound files you need to downlad another torrent that has a full .nrg file. See http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3758280/Sibelius_5_Hybrid_DVD_(with_working_windows_keygen). This other torrent is Sibelius 5.0 installation DVD.  This is what you can do:
-Download and install 5.1
-Download the .nrg and mount it with deamontools to install the sound banks from it.
Remember that the sounds are not requirement to run Sibelius, it is a very big file (3GB+). You can always use the Microsoft synth (but it sucks)
On the other hand, there seems to be a bug in Sibelius (still in 5.1). You cannot save playback configuration unless you install the synth and sounds from the cd. So it is even more recommended.
Please, do tell us if you have issues, but please (really please) first you should RTFM !! This version ""should"" work with vista, but you never know, so xp is recommended (by me at least) if you really want an stable production environment. 
Enjoy!"
,flowerfaerie087,2008-02-03T17:50Z,"I've done everything now but when I try to open the program it gets up to 'initialising playback system', waits for a few minutes and then stops responding and has to close.  T__T"" I was so excited as well!!  "
,yulatheterror,2008-06-20T09:55Z,so does this work on vista or not
,fisha,2008-06-22T09:59Z,I'm sorry but how do you dowload?
,yulatheterror,2008-06-29T05:34Z,does this work on vista
,Subduer,2008-07-10T13:56Z,"Everybody who's asking if it works on Vista (fucking read idiots!!!)

,hwrdmltn,2009-04-12T02:20Z,"For you idiots that can't get this running, unplug your computer and accessories, put it back in the boxes you received it in, and return it to the store or place of purchase - you're too stupid to own a computer! Spend your money on simple things instead like soda pop and ice cream because you have too much money that you must have stole - your not smart enough to have earned it! This torrent works just fine - read the fucking text files and DO exactly what it says! Can you say ""follow instructions""?"
,hwrdmltn,2009-04-12T02:22Z,"And to therpandrus, Thanx!!!"
,ThomasDunn,2009-04-22T10:51Z,"Hi. I downloaded the software and ran it as admin then it said I need a registration key? 
Is there anything I can do?"
,wesleyroyer,2009-05-03T07:53Z,Does this torrent include the Sound Essentials?  The last Sibelius torrent I downloaded was Sibelius only and I got really shitty sound quality from Microsoft's default MIDI.
,jsdrum1,2009-06-03T16:03Z,Anyone working on Sibelius 6 torrent?
,fiddlecamp,2009-08-13T22:40Z,Hello -- I downloaded Sibelius 5.2 - works great but can't seem to print.  Help?
