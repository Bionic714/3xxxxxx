,Zeph001,2008-01-26T05:16Z,"/me laughs at the above comments. What? No high res covers, subs and special promotional code that gets me a free Ferrari with the colour of my choice to go with this? And where are my free high class hookers for downloading this from you? Jesus! The nerve of you to upload a movie without an IMDB link. Loser!

Thanks. It's an incredibly dumb chick flick. I just happen to be a sucker for it."
