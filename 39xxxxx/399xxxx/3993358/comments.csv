I also have Brigade Combat Team, but unfortunately it was written with a Sony cd-r back in 2000, and they used some proprietary format (non iso).  That drive is long gone, and I have to figure out a way to read this disk.  I USED to have point of attack, but I havent run across it yet.  I'm still looking."

And the Scenario editor is corrupt or something.It wont read any files."

the series is awesome.  I will continue to help seed for the next two years. 

all you have to do is unzip and drop nomandy44 folder in your c:/programfiles/hps/ folder.  

if this is your first hps title, then create a blank hps folder in c: programfiles

good luck.  "
