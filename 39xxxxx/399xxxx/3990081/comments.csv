Try this site:

,ultrasonicpheasant,2008-01-30T15:35Z,"Just download Media Player Classic or VLC, it'll work fine."
,radradrobotank,2008-02-28T10:19Z,"Thanks, uploader.

This file has AC3 audiom which is why it won't play in Windows Media, etc. Like some others suggested, just use VLC. Windows Media and Real Player are crap anyway. VLC handles a huge variety of file types and codecs, and will solve most of your video player problems."
