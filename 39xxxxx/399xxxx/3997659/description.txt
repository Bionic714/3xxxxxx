Disc One

For whom the bell tolls
Battery
Fight fire with fire
Motorbreath
Master of puppets
Fuel
One
Whiskey in the jar
The unforgiven
Hit the lights
Mama said
Sad but true
Die, die my darling


Disc Two

Welcome home (Sanitarium)
Escape
Ain\'t my bitch
Jump in the fire
Enter sandman
...And justice for all
Fade to black
So what
Wherevey i may roam
Harvester of sorrow
Turn the page
The memory remains


Disc Three

Ride the lightning
Until it sleeps
Disposable heroes
Seek & destroy
Blackened
Creeping death
St. Anger
Loverman
The unforgiven II
Nothing else matters
