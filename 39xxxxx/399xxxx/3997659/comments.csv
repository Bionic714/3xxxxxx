,FlamingAnt,2008-02-14T03:08Z,thanks for the up but would it hurt to have put orion in there?
,atom224,2008-02-15T19:01Z,"excellent job here !  great songs and great quality, thanks for taking the time to make & share."
,R.Lindblad,2008-02-19T09:40Z,THNX  XD
,805566,2008-02-20T00:06Z,"@Diz FUCK MCR and all you slit-my-wrist emofags. (early) Metallica is mean stuff, which anyone would notice upon removing balls from anus and earning the title of rock fan.

Awesome choice of tunes. Please continue to seed."
,gilbypoleadamson,2008-02-24T16:35Z,"These mixes could have been so much better, if your a true Metallica fan or even someone who doesn't Metallica, don't download this. "
,mazca,2008-03-11T20:14Z,"Thanks friend. Still making my mind up about whether I like Metallica overall, haha - this will surely help. ;)"
,dgx,2008-04-09T01:10Z,Fantastic download! Seeding now :) Enjoy!
,lovax,2008-04-29T12:56Z,"@ gilbypoleadamson
You were gonna say that if you took the time and effort to compile such a compilation, you would have put a slightly different collection of songs on it?
Fcuking moron, my ass.

Great collection! Keep seeding!"
,double_b26,2008-05-02T12:37Z,alot of great songs in there... although i think i could shrink it down to two awesome discs.
,ticktock_man,2008-05-08T16:22Z,"""thanks for the up but would it hurt to have put orion in there?""

no shit. fuel, loverman and st. anger is on there but orion isnt? HAHA"

The Worst Album I ever heard. 

Hard rock sux so much. Hiphop 4 Ever"
,gruta,2008-06-04T10:55Z,"lol hiphop is for the ones that cant learn to play a guitar, or sing, or have musical talent.

they can just talk fast, hiphop sucks"
,butterbean,2008-06-05T20:44Z,"wow this is great.but,one song could be on one of the cd:s,for the memory of cliff burton,and it´s ""orion""."
,butterbean,2008-06-05T20:50Z,"oh...forgotten to mention i got all the cd:s in orginal,if someone should start to yell.and i was there at the concert 86 solnahallen just a few hours before cliff was killed in that that accident at döarp in sweden,i will never forget him.R.I.P"
,perfectforever,2008-08-11T12:20Z,Help! New at this.. downloaded file but when I play the songs they keep jumping to the next one in the middle of the song? 
,SlavidQuarente,2008-08-22T21:47Z,This is pretty stupid; if you want the Best of the Best just grab the discography and only download the first 4 albums
,paranj,2008-08-23T20:30Z,"Hats off to you man. Thanks a lot. Superb quality and a good collection :). The quality really is good. One gripe though, is Metallica hard rock? zOMG i neve knew. Anyways, that is not a serious mistake :) 

Will help seed i think. Already crossed 1.1 mark :)."
,chookymeister,2008-09-03T17:52Z,"you dont hav call of the ktulu in there, so i hate you"

the greatest metal band ever..."
,narutoxela,2009-03-13T01:18Z,"Thanks!!!!


fast download!! :)  733kb/s!!!!!"
,CitizenRaven,2009-07-08T10:23Z,"At best, this is a collection of the most basic Metallica songs out there. There is much more to the band than One, Seek & Destroy, and Nothing Else Matters. Not garbage by a longshot, but not that original either."
,shiboleth,2009-07-18T02:57Z,"@ Everyone,

 If you want the best metal years of metallica..this is the torrent you need....it s not the alternative  years that full of crap song..only pure metal at its best....http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4996216/Metallica_-_Greatest_Hits.....by Masterkosmos..."
,shiboleth,2009-07-18T03:02Z,"@ razor21,

 your wrong Black Sabbath is the greatest  metal band coz   they are the one who pioneered it.....Metallica now a days are not kind metal  anymore......alternative metal now  he he he"
,martian_neighbour,2009-09-12T03:11Z,why would you include the covers you made yourself you idiot !!
,holden77,2010-06-05T13:10Z,"I hate Metalica but i know if i download this it will piss James Hetfield off, when I'm done I'll leave a stack of CD's outside the record store."
,schmitty84,2010-07-12T14:45Z,"I don\'t understand why any song from St. Anger is on here. Even James said it wasn\'t a good album.  Also, why are cover songs they performed on here? I love turn the page by metallica, but it doesn\'t belong on a greatest hits cd. Did you just select random songs from all of the years or what?"
,tarikfx,2010-08-01T08:14Z,looks promising
,DaNtsu,2010-09-07T17:58Z,"you could have told us which are covers so you dont have to download and find out yourself -.-
i dont want your fucking covers."
,shawnemaher,2010-09-13T13:22Z,"OK you lot, I've noticed some bickering with people saying there is better metallica songs out there and so forth, well look, if you read the info he clearly stated ""This is my Favourite songs with Metallica"". Not what you lot think is the best but what he thinks is the best. Now he's covered a lot of ground with this many songs. Have some appreciation for the torrent. If you don't like it, go to another torrent"
,Zasz1,2011-10-20T20:39Z,Great quality Great songs! Thank you!
