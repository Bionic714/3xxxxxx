,artytorrent,2008-01-26T03:36Z,"I have lots of bass samples (and a few choirs) in various sample formats, but I don't intend to upload them for a while. I don't really use Kontakt very much, but I dug these out as a favour for you, Drax.
Just to confirm for other potential downloaders, this sample pack is made of two Kontakt 2 instruments. If you already have the standard Kontakt 2 library, you already have them."
,drax12,2008-01-29T08:22Z,You answered my request and made my day.  Hope I didn't sound ungrateful.  I use synths too; but real strings will always be cool  (including electric guitar) I hope more people can use these.  Best bass sample I've heard was called coolbass from fruityloops but they cut it off short!! I use one-shots 'cause I'm a control freak; loops feel like I'm just a remixer. Thanks again.
,artytorrent,2008-02-02T06:32Z,"Hey, I know exactly what you mean about using loops. That's why I don't like construction kit sample CDs. A monkey could arrange a track when the parts are laid out like that! It takes time and effort to make tunes as useless as mine! :D
I know that ""CoolBass"" sample. I've just uploaded a bunch of Electric Bass Guitars that might just be as useful, as they have a bit more sustain: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4007975"
,Jad-B,2008-05-20T18:40Z,"The "".nki"" files are 'Native Instruments Instrument Files' 
These are instrument files for Native Instruments samplers, i.e. Kontakt/Kompakt Player. Typically found in a subfolder called INSTRUMENTS under the LIBRARY folder

Just so you know.


Peace

,StrangeBones,2009-11-21T15:28Z,"Hey, Arty, you've got some excellent samples on here! Since Demonoid is down until whenever, I guess I may have to come over here and provide some ""competition"" for you!  I have loads of wav samples that I'd love to give back to the community.  
Preeshy-ate all you do!!!"
