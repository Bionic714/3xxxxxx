ArtyTorrent Pack 21-Kontakt Violin + Cello WAV samples
----------------------------------------------------

Posted as a quick response to a request from drax12. Includes the Kontakt 2 NKIs and samples for the full frequency range of the Violin and Cello ensembles. The WAVs can be loaded into any sampler, of course.
At some point I'll upload the full Kontakt 2 DVD set, so this is just a taster for people will low bandwidth.
