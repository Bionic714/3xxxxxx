Kohan: Immortal Soverigns for Windows XP

---------------------------------------------------

I have verified that this works on my computer. Here are the steps to install it:

---------------------------------------------------

1.) Mount the image found in the torrent using Daemon Tools, or whatever program can handle .cue sheet files.

2.) Once you've install the game, make sure to replace the kohan.exe file in your installation folder with the cracked one found on the CD image itself in the "Crack" folder. (Make sure to always make a backup of your original file, just in case.)

3.) Hopefully, at this point, you should be able to run the game. If not, I have a few tips below that helped me run the game.

Tips:

- If it doesn't work for you, try making a shortcut that links to the kohan.exe (do not run the game using the autorun menu on the CD image) and change the compatibility mode of the shortcut to run the program in "Windows 98 / Windows Me" Mode.

- After making the shortcut, run the shortcut while the CD image is mounted on a virtual drive (IMPORTANT!)

- At this point, the game usually works for me, when I run the game through the shortcut I made while the CD image is mounted. If it still doesn't work, I'm not sure what else to do... hopefully, somebody can help you out if you post in the comments section. 

Good Luck and Enjoy this great game!
