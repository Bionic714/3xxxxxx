,pinkfluffybunny,2008-03-20T17:10Z,"I can't seem to get Daemon Tools to mount the .cue  file at all. It keeps popping up a ""Stream read error"".
I've even tried re-downloading the whole torrent. 

Any ideas on how to get this working would be greatly appreciated. "
,Talthanis,2008-03-21T18:43Z,"I would try getting the newest version of deamon tools, or re-downloading your version.

Can anyone help me with step 2, I don't fully understand how to do this part and I can not fins a ""Crack"" folder. 

Thx"
,Rubiksfaq,2008-03-23T09:31Z,"For Step 2, mount the ISO on your virtual drive (if it isn't already, from installing it). Then, through ""My Computer,"" right-click on the virtual drive with the CD ISO loaded on it, and choose ""open"" or ""explore"" the drive. Directly on the CD ISO, there should be a folder called ""crack."" This is where the cracked .exe file that you need to play the game w/o a CD is located. At this point, just copy and paste this file into the main directory where you installed Kohan at, making sure to at least make a backup of the original .exe first (by renaming it, or changing the extension of the original file).

Okay, I hope this helps ya; just holla if you need anymore help.

,Rubiksfaq,2008-04-23T06:53Z,"To arminfific92:

It may mean that you are working on a computer on which you do not have administrator access. The long and short of it is that you may have to look at the ""user accounts"" option in the Control Panel (may be different with Windows Vista) and check to see if you using a true administrator account or a limited account that has certain features cut off (like installing games or updating them, etc.) If you're using a limited account, you may have to ask the person with admin access to help you install the game.

,arminfific92,2008-04-23T15:29Z,Ohh all right thanks Rubiksfaq
,mus5tlm,2008-05-03T12:04Z,"im having troubles. I installed, replaced the kohan.exe with the cracked one, made a new shortcut and set it to run in compatability mode with 98/me. I am logged in as an administrator, but when i try to run, the screen flicks to black, then back to the desktop again and nothing else happens. Any tips anyone?"
,Rubiksfaq,2008-05-07T13:51Z,"To mus5tlm:

I'm not sure what's wrong... it could be just with your computer. I would recommend the 3 R's right now:

1.) Reinstall the program
2.) Reboot the computer
3.) If all else fails, Reformat your computer and reinstall your OS.

The 3rd step usually fixes most everything =) Sorry I couldn't help more than that.
