The Samuel Jackson Five, or the SJ5, started up a couple of years ago as a failed drum'n'bass-project. After numerous changes in material, instruments, visions and band members, they've finally released our debut album. It has received good reviews and enabled us to do a fair amount of gigs. The Samuel Jackson Five have always been an alternative to the mainstream acts and see no reason to change that now. They let each individual explore and push their own limits, without losing focus on the melody. The outcome is ever changing but often leads to ethereal, experimental, improvised, dynamic music. Or at least thats what we think.

This is superb postrock music from an excellent up-and-coming band, please buy the albums if you like them. They deserve some actual credit for doing this!
