Mysteriez! is a newly born innovation in casual games. 

It's a multiplayer hidden-object game from WellGames.com. 

There's no any complicated story and the world is not in danger. 
It's just you having fun trying to find the required number of numbers on the screen. 
The numbers are hidden in every possible way in the setting of a location. 
The game being so simple is actually quite challenging. In the very first level you are to find up to 32 numbers. 
At the beginning everything goes pretty smoothly but it's only till you find yourself stuck with the last one having no idea where it is. Plus the time is almost out. So, the game is fun.
