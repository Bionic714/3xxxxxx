Veteran pharmaceutical research scientist and member of Adobe's Biomedical Image Advisory Group, Eric J. Wexler shares his experience creating detailed biomedical imaging in  Photoshop CS3 Extended for Biomedical Research. Eric shows how to use Photoshop CS3's selection, analysis, and editing tools to evaluate an image's color composition, modify images for research, optimize exposure with levels and curves, transform images with layers, and compensate for acquisition problems and limitations. Eric also explains how to add reference information to images, annotate and optimize DICOM animations, and share finished images with colleagues. Exercise files accompany the tutorials.
