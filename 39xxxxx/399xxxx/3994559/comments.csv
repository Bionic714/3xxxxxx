,TheNightOwl,2008-02-12T01:41Z,"Question: On Neil Young's website, http://www.neilyoung.com/archives/gh_technotes_vinyl.html, it says (on the second page), 'A special bonus 7"" 45 RPM mono single of ""The Loner"" b/w ""Sugar Mountain"" was included ...'. But ""The Loner"" sounds stereo to me (agreeing with your download notes and artwork). Why does Neil Young's website say the song is in mono?"
,DLedin,2008-02-14T02:06Z,"My guess is that they just goofed. The track is indeed stereo as is indicated on the 45rpm label.
Thanks all for the comments.
