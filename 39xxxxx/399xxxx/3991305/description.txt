Club Dread (2004) 

At Club Dread (an island retreat off the coast of Costa Rica for swinging singles), imbibing alcohol and just about every other narcotic is heartily encouraged. But festivities come to an abrupt halt when a mad killer with a machete begins to slice and dice the partygoers. It's up to Bill Paxton, Jay Chandrasekhar and other members of the Broken Lizard troupe to stop the insanity while keeping their swanky jobs â?¦ and their heads!
