Happy Birthday, NUCLEAR BLAST! The label from Donzdorf, Germany, turns 20 in 2007 ? and "Into The Light" 
is one of the company's first presents, given by no one else than RAGE composer and multi instrumentalist 
Victor Smolski. It was him who composed, arranged and recorded the album, with all in all ten songs based 
on a thrilling, solid Power Metal foundation. But the real highlights are the participants behind the 
microphones: Victor gathered a conglomeration of ten singers whose bands have been signed to NUCLEAR BLAST 
in the past 20 years or still are on the label's roster, among them Hansi Kürsch of BLIND GUARDIAN, 
NIGHTWISH's former singer Tarja Turunen, EDGUY's Tobi Sammet and HELLOWEEN'S Andi Deris.

All together, the NUCLEAR BLAST ALLSTARS created a haunting and remarkable album, reflecting different 
shades of musical emotions ? hard & thrashy ('Bloodsuckers'), heavy & modern ('Eternally'), 
bombastic ('Death Is Alive') or catchy & powerful ('In The Picture').

Discover new shades and qualities of your favourite singers and enjoy this brilliant anniversary album 
together with your friends and NUCLEAR BLAST! As a special gift, "Into The Light" will be released as 
double-CD, featuring a bonus disc with classics tracks and brand new songs. (A compilation CD)

Also, watch out for "Into The Light"'s dark twin "Out Of The Dark", coming for you in the second half of 2007?
