Mr_Cup"
,FatFuckFrank,2008-01-22T15:05Z,who wants to sponsor FFF?
,Mr_Cup,2008-01-22T16:09Z,"I would if I wasn't poor as balls.. But I do have an account at a hosting site and I might be able to hook you up with a domain and a whole bunch of hosting space/traffic. Hell I'd even set it up and maintain if for you. Free of charge. But then again I know jack all about html, php or cms. 

Could always use TPB tracker and just host the torrents at the site which would save time and keep you from getting sued.. Then rake in the money from advertising!

I'm just getting ahead of myself though.

,sweets1970,2008-01-23T05:17Z,"dudes, TPB is the only site we need.  The FedEx method has been proven to be superior."
,Mr_Cup,2008-01-23T12:04Z,"Fuck that... I want ALL of FFF.

But I figure if I can get more free twisted porn while making the dude who gives me such perverse videos some money and a place for fans to hit him up for porn/give $$ I might as well try.. Meh, your doing fine here I guess.. I'll just stick to saying ""Thanks"" from now on then.

,FatFuckFrank,2008-01-23T16:41Z,I can be reached at fatfreakfrank@hotmail.com.....let's give it a try; I'll got a sicker collection that I can post; I keep the tame stuff for TPB
,Mr_Cup,2008-01-25T16:46Z,"I know you don't want a website or whatever, but I had a spare twenty minutes so I thought I'd knock up a mock website..

Yeah it ain't great and I'm not expecting anyone to like it but I have a lot of free time to waste.. (I've got insomnia and crazy depression.) So check it out if you can be fucked.
