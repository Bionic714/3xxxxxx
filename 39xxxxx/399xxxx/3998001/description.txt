Iommi 1st solo album but the record label refused to release unless it was released under the Black Sabbath name...eventually settling on Black Sabbath "Featuring Tony Iommi".


The Band:
Tony Iommi - All Guitars
Glenn Hughes - Vocals
Eric Singer - Drums
Dave Spitz - Bass
Geoff Nichols - Keyboards


Tracks:
1. In For The Kill
2. No Stranger To Love
3. Turn To Stone
4. Sphinx (The Guardian)
5. Seventh Star
6. Danger Zone
7. Heart Like A Wheel
8. Angry Heart
9. In Memory 

This really is a good CD..not Heavy like Sabbath, but more of a Blues/Rock sound.
