,Mattias_1991,2008-01-29T01:05Z,Thank you! You are my god! Really nice. And nice that the other disks will be uploaded to! =D
,pinkcarebear,2008-01-29T04:13Z,Yeah there's one more disc after this to be uploaded. When there gets about 6 or so seeds I'll start uploading it.
,arthax666,2008-01-30T19:56Z,"stuck on 36.5%, please seed so we can keep this for long time online!
thanks"
,digitalnova,2008-01-30T21:20Z,"stuck on 36.5% too, please seed"
,Leathco,2008-01-31T02:36Z,"Thanks for this, was hoping someone would upload it.  Can't wait for the second disc to come up!"
,justin1388,2008-02-01T05:47Z,"The tracker on both the site and my client says there's 2 seeds, but whenever I connect to the torrent the seeds drop to zero. This is happening to my friends who are trying to download, too. 

What gives? This was only being seeded for about a day and then the pinkcarebear jumped off of it. Damn shame, this has been out since December and this was the first rip."
,mkermac,2008-02-01T20:58Z,"First of all, thank you very much for this, because I doubt where I live Screw Attack ships...

Second, I don't know if this is going to be fully seeded, seeing as everyone is stuck at 36.5%.What's going on? Can you reup it?
"
,bengtsson78,2008-02-06T20:58Z,Yea that would be great Im also stuck and really would like to have this.
,digitalnova,2008-02-07T16:16Z,Plese pinkcarebear seed!!!
,avgnfan99,2008-02-11T21:35Z,screw it i'll seed this.
,avgnfan99,2008-02-11T21:45Z,there its seeding. don't compain about the upload speed though.
,Mattias_1991,2008-02-11T22:34Z,Thank you for seeding. At least now it's moving. 
,justin1388,2008-02-13T15:40Z,"avgnfan99; just caught on an hour ago that you started seeding this!

i'm 36.7% with 10kb/s down and ~40kb/s up right now. eta is 2 days 7 hours, but i'm hoping you'll hang in there until i finish. "
,avgnfan99,2008-02-13T23:20Z,it's at like 99 percent  so there should be a ton of seeds soon.
,digitalnova,2008-02-14T14:47Z,"Thanks for seeding, I will seed as much as I can :)"
,avgnfan99,2008-02-15T18:05Z,hmm should i upload the second disc?
,Mattias_1991,2008-02-15T19:29Z,avgnfan99: Please do that. It would be so damn nice :)
,justin1388,2008-02-15T23:20Z,"Oops, yeah. I slapped myself on the forehead a few hours after I made that post because lots of people finished shortly after.

I'd love the second disc. I forgot how drastically different James was in his early videos and laughed just as hard as I did when I first saw these. Any easter eggs on disc 1 or 2?"
,digitalnova,2008-02-15T23:27Z,"please post second disc!!!!

Trank you :)"
,digitalnova,2008-02-15T23:28Z,thank you....
,Leathco,2008-02-17T05:58Z,Count this as another vote hoping to see the second disc uploaded.  I'd love to see the other half of this uploaded.
,Leathco,2008-02-17T05:59Z,"Couldn't edit my last post, but also wanted to say thanks for this upload."
,digitalnova,2008-02-21T19:58Z,post second DVD please...
,justin1388,2008-02-25T10:20Z,"the second dvd has the best parts of this dvd set -- the Original intro and outtakes.

for us crazy fans who recorded the angry nintendo nerd song in mp3 through line in while playing back the video on youtube, it would be a real treat to have the original video. after watching the extras in the first dvd, it would be nice to see more of james' real life persona in outtakes, too."
,avgnfan99,2008-03-17T17:09Z,"Here's the link to disc 2
