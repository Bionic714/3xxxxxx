,gubbins,2008-01-28T05:35Z,"This is possibly the most frustrating and dated game in the world. 

Hasn't stopped me playing it for the last 3-5 years. :(

Cheers for the up ..

,king_rat,2008-01-28T06:39Z,The DV expansion really cleans up a lot - I think you'll be happy to get this.
,Gouldblum,2008-01-28T18:36Z,extremly nice game if you can live without gfx and are into deep strategy/management games
,snoo333,2008-02-08T02:45Z,"one of the most underated games in past couple ofyear.  

blows medieval out of the water, except for the 3d battles.  then again who cares. 

awesome upload, i will help keep this alive. 

if you dl and like please buy the game.  its only 20bucks.  help support the smaller companies.

,king_rat,2008-02-12T07:04Z,"I'd add to that - if you like this, you might like other Paradox games.

,javfar,2008-04-03T14:50Z,I have a problem: Everything works fine until I try to start a new game. Then the game crashes. Any suggestions?
,king_rat,2008-04-08T07:34Z,"Unfortunately, no - the included readme.txt lays out what you should be doing to get it all to work.  If you followed those instructions, then I don't really know what to add.

Perhaps uninstalling it and reinstalling it according to the instructions could help... but I realize that's not really that helpful of a hint.  Sorry."
,javfar,2008-04-10T11:53Z,@king_rat: thansk for answering. i have reinstalled it several times. I use Vista. Could that cause the problem?
,badanha,2008-04-18T22:01Z,"375 MB for the game and the expansion is this rigth? Can someone confirm please.

@javfar: Yes the problem can be on the OS, since the game is a bit old and maybe it don't supports Windows Vista. Good Luck."
,Negru_Voda,2008-05-12T17:30Z,if this is awesome as it looks.. I'll buy it.. Paradox Games deserve my money.. they truly make my kind of games
,Krikon10,2008-06-06T23:42Z,What's the Deus Vult expansion ?
,king_rat,2008-06-16T09:39Z,"@Krikon10: The expansion is really a collection of bug fixes and interface upgrades - the fundamental game isn't really changed much, but crashes and gameplay are improved significantly."
,Roland19303,2008-07-08T13:34Z,Yes 375 should be about the correct size. This is a 2d game and doesn't contain any complicated textures or anything. 
,Prinz_Eugen,2008-07-12T18:00Z,Don`t u have other Paradox`s games?
,api92,2008-12-08T20:28Z,"Can someone help my ... when i-m playing its comes up some ""fatal error "" its says : unhandled error expception detected Addres 0x0044BC53 Please report! (more imformation in log file)

I'm playing in vista ...

plz help !"
,MePhIsThO,2009-07-01T14:30Z,"I'm getting the same error that api92 reported above (more then six months ago...), but I'm playing on XP.

The ""exceptions"" file says:
""######## EXCEPTION: 0xC0000005 at address: 0x0044BC53: ACCESS VIOLATION  read attempt to address 0x00000180 
07/01/09 09:13:08

StackWalk(): GetLastError = 487""

Maybe the  problem is that I just couldn't update the game to the v.1.05 when I installed it, 'cause the patch says that the game isn't installed in my computer.

What should I do? I'm willing to buy the game soon, but I want to keep playing it until the arrival of the package..."
,Juggernawt,2009-08-19T10:24Z,You can buy it online at Gamersgate.com for very cheap. Digital download so no need to wait for discs

,Seamus152,2012-07-03T22:57Z,I'm sick and fucking tired of trying to play this. I've installed and uninstalled this 43 times. I can't get rid of these freaking black lines making it impossible to read anything when mousing over an option someone tell me how to get rid of this.
