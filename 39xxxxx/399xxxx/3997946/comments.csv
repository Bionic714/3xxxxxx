,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-10-26T16:50Z,"If you look at a torrent and it has no screenshots (for porn) or a link to boxcover/official info about the file ( for films or tvseries etc) first search thepiratebay often someone else has uploaded the same file & bothered to include screenshots or google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia and then copy and paste links to the info you find to help everyone else out who dont know what the file is , please dont be as disgustingly lazy as 99.9% of tpb users and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself it only takes a few seconds per file ( once youve found the info) ,the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now please. see http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/10/01/coica-bill-postponed-its-time-to-discuss-alternatives-to-traditional-dns/
Also keep seeding dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets you upload ,the faster your upload speed the faster you download speed is for recieving data thats how bittorent works !
im not a hypocrite sometimes when i go to post info tpb says database error failed to write..i dont have time to remember to go back to the files i couldnt help out on..so if u spot files needing info please help out.A good place to get help is http://forum.suprbay.org/index.php report fake files or drm files there ,ps if you look at porn remember to respect women theyre gods greatest creation."
