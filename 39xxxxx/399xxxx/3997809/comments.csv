,oraleric34,2008-01-28T12:55Z,"Thank you for your sweet work. I downloaded them all. I must say 90% I didn't keep but there are a few UNBELIEVABLE diamonds in there that it's worth ALL THE WAY! Those diamond tracks I forgot about, but they gave me such a fantastic teenage remembrance ... I can't explain it! Again THANK YOU SO MUCH!"

I almost gave up but now that I see you collect rare vinyls, I'm REALLY hoping you have that track.
Please let me know!  Thanks!"
[V],80zforever,2008-02-05T05:45Z,fem2fem I am sorry. I don't think I have it. Good luck with finding it tough. Just out of curosity was this written by Joseph McKenna? kind of discoish? 
,fem2fem,2008-02-11T18:03Z,"Yes it was written by Joseph McKenna and it's like a disco concerto ... very campy with lots of string instruments.  I have it on audio cassette but the quality is not very good. Would be lovely if I could get the mp3!  Anyway, thanks for replying.  You really know your 80's stuff!  Do drop me an e-mail if you ever manage to find this track. My addy is peachybuns@gmail.com and my name is Liana.
Thanks so much!"
