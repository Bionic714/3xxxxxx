[V],TheExecutive,2008-06-09T00:10Z,"The seeders no doubt use high speed equipment as we do. The problem is in the software....and that as of this typing there aren't any seeders.   I have 2 peers to work with and the download is coming along fine (even if it is a bit slow).

I never heard Chocolate Watchband before, but I read that decades after they broke up the original members reformed in 2000 and they were still touring last year.  How much new material have they written or are they only doing modern versions of all their old stuff?"
