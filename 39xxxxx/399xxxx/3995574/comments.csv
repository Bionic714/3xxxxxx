Please do me a favour after you have listened to this release & give it a rating on a scale of 1 - 5 (1 = crap & 5 = Excellent)

Just to satisfy my curiosity  ;)"

It's got a little extra heaviness in a lot of the guitar work, which is a little different for them, but still the album rocks.  Their latest album ""Born Into This"" is more of a ""back to basics"" album, which is great and is a little better than ""Beyond Good and Evil"", but this is still a great album!!  Thanks for sharing it!!!"
