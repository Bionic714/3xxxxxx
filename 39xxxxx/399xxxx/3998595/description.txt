I am uploading the screen grab from:

You can log on a see a  Macromedia of the same thing I am uploading. Just CLICK ON the link and pick the Hatsu basho 2008 - Jour (NOW the day you want) - Makuuchi. This is SCREEN RECORDED and about 640x480 quality ( so so ) but does included Japanese sound commentary and should be a quick download with a few seeders. 

Hope you enjoy SUMO LITE and if you do, PLEASE SEED!

All I can say is WOW! What a BASHO. And if anyone says day 15 is dull, and no one works hard on day 15, wait till you see today! WOW! 

BTW, would anyone like me to make and ISO for DVD burning of all 15 days on one DVD? Let me know here and I will pop one up.
