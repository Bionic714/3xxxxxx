Do you know if where I can find the Aki Basho 2007 day 10-15 matches? Is there some feed with Macromedia anywhere?

Thanks for your kind efforts!"

[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-01-31T02:53Z,The FRENCH site seems to have all the video gone. I do not read french so I can not be sure. Can someone check and let us know?
,cptnemo55,2008-02-01T00:21Z,"anyone else have trouble with seeing the vids on info-sumo?  I have never been able to, even after registering. 

When I go to view a days matches, it just scrolls through the names of all the bouts but doesnt show the actual bout.  I have tried everything I can think of, but to no avail, and I cant speak french so I cant figure it out or know who to ask for help.

Can anyone help?"
,cptnemo55,2008-02-01T00:24Z,"By the way SciFi, 
thanks for putting these up here - one because I have no way to see them otherwise, and two because I am giving a presentation of Sumo to non-sumo-philes and these files are great to be able to pick out some interesting bouts to introduce people to Sumo with."
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-02-01T00:39Z,"@CPT. I use Firefox. Try that. They play fine for me. Happy you like it. You may want to look also at  http://www.sumofanmag.com/index.php

[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-03-02T03:35Z,"Does anyone else on the planet have access to the broadcast in english? Does ZLO have the new SAT codes? I hate to wait and plan to web grab the LITE off the FRENCH site each day but not the same as full show or even in English. So, anyone, with a week to go, how are we looking. Sumo starved and hungry for more... SciFi-Sumo out!"
,he-hulk,2008-03-04T08:17Z,what would be the odds of you getting some of the web versions from last years bashos and posting the up here???   also looking forward to your next lite series
