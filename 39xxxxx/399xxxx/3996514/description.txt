Arling and Cameron

The second cd on the Basta label by pop-dance mixmeisters Arling & Cameron was originally released in a special fold-out digipak in 1998. It was
reissued in a more standard packaging in 2000. Customers ordering from our website will still receive the digipak.
 
This time they are assisted by cartoonist & designer Joost Swarte, who developed the beautiful CD package. The music is bubbly and danceable, like
A&C's previous "Easy Tune" releases but in various styles, such as cha-cha, drum 'n bass, and Europop. Chanteuse Fay Lovsky vocalizes in pseudo-French
on Jealousie, and another song features Liesbeth Esselink of Solex. Swarte obtained artistic inspiration from the songs.
 
Arling & Cameron moved to another label (Emperor Norton) in 1999 and continued to produce frothy pop that sounds great both on headphones and on
the dance floor.
