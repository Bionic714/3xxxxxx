This is so far the only usable map I could find for Hungary. 
Great work! Keep it up!
(I'm sure the rest of the downloaders enjoy it just as much, but since they got this they spend more time driving than hanging on torrent sites) :D"
,kuzla,2008-04-01T11:11Z,"How do i use this CD?
Burn it and insert it in navigation or what?
"
,E5M1R,2008-04-12T18:43Z,"Yes just download and burn onto a cd,(with some img burning software i like img burn) make sure you use quality cd otherwise it might not work, Note that this cd is for BMW, High NAV Systems Non i-drive (MK I, MK II, MK III MK, IV) and only i-drive 7 series that uses NAV001, NAV002, NAV003.
PS. Since BMW is a clone of CarIn and VDO Daytona, this CD might work in your CarIn VDO device"
