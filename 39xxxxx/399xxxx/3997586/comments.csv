,mother0fall,2008-01-27T17:53Z,"i hope the windows live programs like photo gallery and writer has been assimilated into this cube.  this little app helps big.
looking forward to installing this on a gaming notebook.  if not would you consider putting it on the next generation?
winborgxp is not bloated with irrelevant crud that would  cramp your warpdrive coils- good work. i thought this series was abandoned until it drop out of warp, decloaked into synchronous orbit ready for more assimilation.
no resistance here.

thanks, g."
,mother0fall,2008-01-28T04:21Z,"hellowwww again, yaawwllll...

dont waste yer time readin' the details beybehh, go ahead and download it now!  you will comply- that's an order.  resistance is stupid!
if you're tired of black xp, and windows johnny gives a blue screen at the end of clean-instawwll, then this release is for yaawwll.  not to rant on those guys(?) work, on the contrary, but, WPI aside, this is THE windows xp install to go with.  everything just works like they should, unlike the other two i mentioned which has some tradeoffs.  
how i wish someone would take the best about the xp-unlimited v.2, crossbreed it with winborg (the current edition), include the windows live apps, and produce the ultimate installler- the winborg xp-species 8472 assimilater edition.
you rock, g!!! future generation of klingons will sing to your glory while sipping their bloodwine (hopefully not harvested from humans).

thanks, we love you.  keep up the great work.
mother0fall say so."

,MoonBloo,2008-03-21T17:44Z,"
I want an app that is on the post-install menu, but I don't want the actual operating system.

Will it work if I deselect everything but powerdesk 6, or can those only be obtained post-installation of the whole OS?

Thanks!"

You not original maker of it. Also why did you steal all the setup screen, login and skin from Black Xp 
31 for use in Last XP 22? Then you bad mouth the creator.
Are you guys jelous or just babaies your stuff is garbage but I guess you call it Winborg to trick people."
