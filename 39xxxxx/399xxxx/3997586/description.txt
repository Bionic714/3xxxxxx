for those that dont use ed2k

November 2007 contents:

DVD BOOT MENU:

* 6 different flavours of Windows XP Professional SP2 to choose from - a \'More Info\' option is also available that will tell you what each option installs.
- the choices involve whether you want:
> to use the driverpacks
> to automatically launch the post-install menu (and thus install the default apps)
> to install the WinBorg theme which is the logon screen (just like in the August release) and the name of \'My Computer\' is renamed to \'The Collective\' (easily renamed back). THe alternative is to install the OS without these \'Borg\' elements.

* a Tools menu is now available with a \'More Info\' option for all the tools.
- the menu is:
> HD Clone Professional 3.2
> Hiren\'s Boot CD 9.2
> Partition Magic 8.05
> Bart\'s Ram Tester 1.4

* my version of Windows Pre-install Environment - this option is available from the Boot Menu and when chosen, Windows XP loads up (ie like a \'Windows on a CD\') using a RAM disc to store all the temporary OS files, 33 apps are installed and its just like the normal Windows XP interface - this means you can play around with an old hard disc that has a stuffed OS (ie won\'t boot up) -- even Burning to DVD is available. IF you run this inside a VM (either VMWare or Virtual PC) you can also connect to your network and to the internet if you\'re connected.

DRIVERPACKS:

* Added 13 new packs - Broadband, Input, Misc, Modem, Monitor, PrintersCanonLaserjet, Scanner, SmartCardReader, TouchScreen, TV, USB, Virtual machine, WebCam
* 2 of the 6 options for the OS don\'t use the driverpacks, the other 4 do. See above for more info.
* The full list of included driverpacks is:
- Broadband 7.04.16
- Chipset 7.10.1
- CPU 7.04.1
- Graphics A 7.10
- Graphics B 7.10
- Graphics C 7.09.1
- Input 7.09.23
- LAN 7.10.1
- MassStorage 7.09.2
- Misc 7.11.23
- Modem 7.09.22
- Monitor 7.11
- PrintersCanonLaserjet 6.10.20
- Scanner 6.08.31
- SmartCardReader 7.09
- Sound A 7.11
- Sound B 7.10.1
- TouchScreen 7.08
- TV 7.09
- USB 6.08.31
- Virtual 7.08
- WebCam 7.02.18
- WLAN 7.09.2

SETUP THEMES:

* There are 5 different setup themes. Each option refers to the OS menu options available from the boot menu. Only the WinBorg XP setup theme has billboard text. The rest are just pictures.

* The list is:
- option 1: Blue Sky
- option 2: Infinite Improbability Drive
- option 3: Panic Attack
- option 4: Panic Attack
- option 5: Stream of Beauty
- option 6: WinBorg XP

These have no effect on the final resulting OS - i thought i\'d add some variety to the install screens. I like the panic attack one the best.

THE OPERATING SYSTEM:

* The OS is Windows XP Professional with SP2, IE7, and WMP11 integrated. You should not need to download any further hotfixes, and you should be able to \'validate\' at any time with any OS you install from this DVD.

* The list of integrated hotfixes is extremely long and there\'s so many there\'s little point wading through them all, it would be tedious in the extreme! But.... if you must know the list, click here: hotfix list

* Pre-installed apps and updates:
- Java Runtime Environment 6 update 3
- MS .Net Framework 2.0
--- note: the reason for forcing this installation on you is that a fix has been installed called the Tool-Tip-Fixer 1.0.1 (see addons) - it requires Net Framework 2.0 for it to work. And so do many other applications. Every OS option on this DVD installs this so i\'m sorry if this isn\'t a good thing for you - it is for me!
- Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.10 with the latest version of flash
- the SPTD driver v1.50
- User Profile Hive Cleanup Service
- Kel\'s Visual Styles Pack
- VMware Tools
- Virtual PC Additions
- XVID 1.1.3

* Your control panel will have 56 objects after install, and the apps are all current as of November 20, 2007.

Problems with the release:
- there was a mistake made with reference to input languages, unfortunately, some were removed from the OS. For those who are missing languages from the BASIC group (ie any languages that aren\'t right-to-left, and aren\'t East Asian), please download and install the following fix:
