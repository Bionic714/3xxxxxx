I ripped the AC3 files from the Lamentations DVD via DVD Decrypter
  *file mode > select main movie files > stream processing
  *select only the multi-channel stream > demux

I do have to note that this is not 5.1. There are only 5 channels - there is no SUB/LFE channel. However, if you have the software or capable hardware/speakers, you can redirect the bass from the other channels to the sub. I use foobar2000 and a plug-in called Channel Mixer to redirect the bass to the SUB channel. The plug-in even has a feature that lets me keep the satellite speakers intact, so while I have bass being directed to the SUB channel, the other channels don't lose their bass.

If you're not sure what to do with AC3, foobar2000 can play AC3 and convert it to another format, like FLAC or MP3. But beware - AC3 is technically a lossy format, if you convert it to a lossless format, like FLAC, it will drastically increase the file size. I tried converting the files to lossless and the files quadrupled in size! So it's best to keep them in AC3 if you can help it.

As you can see from the track list, there are two sets here. First they played the entire Damnation album, with the addition of Harvest from the Blackwater Park album. After that, they played a heavy set featuring songs from Blackwater Park and Deliverance. I'd also like to note that Closure has an extended ending/jam.
