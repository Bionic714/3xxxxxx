If you don't mind, wikipedia says v3 goes from #1-89 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man#Bibliography

but your torrent goes from 1-50. Is this deliberate and do you have any plan to release the missing ones?

Thanks again,

So sorry, my bad. I missed the 'part 1' in the title.

I'll be seeding for a bit too, but I'm on a slow ADSL conn myself."
