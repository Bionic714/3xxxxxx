,teenagefreedomfighter,2008-03-28T03:48Z,"Someone needs to take season 2, format it force PC and them upload it. Because 13GB (especially when you only want the second half) is excessive at best. Though i do commend the uploader for putting the effort in to rip and upload this ridiculously high quality version."
,bonobosik,2008-03-28T22:25Z,"teenagefreedomfighter, what exactly do you mean by ""format it force PC""? BTW, if you needed Season 2 only you could just download IT_Crowd.Series2 directory from the torrent."
,jojo02,2008-04-06T19:37Z,"I only want series 2, how can I get that, without getting series 1? I do want all the menus and stuff."
,bonobosik,2008-04-25T00:03Z,"jojo02, you really should consider reading your torrent client documentation"

Would you mind to upload also the 3rd season in DVD full? It is impossible to find it."
