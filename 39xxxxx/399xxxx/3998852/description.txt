These are full DVD9s for The IT Crowd, both series.

I found the first one on some shitty private torrent, the second one was purchased from Amazon.

Nothing has been stripped, so you get all the menus, leet subtitles and extras.

This really is a hilarious show, so please buy a DVD if you liked it.

I would love to use this opportunity to address all the private trackers (feedthe.net, funfile, moviex, waffles, etc) - you suck. All you provide can be found on ThePirateBay, download speed is much better here and there is no bullshit like ratios.

Cheers.
