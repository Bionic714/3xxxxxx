The Bay Area producer/turntablist takes a novel approach to hip-hop/jazz fusion with an instrumental album that could be considered groundbreaking in either genre.  Combining dope sample arrangements with live drums (Zach Hash) and alto sax (Lucas Desmond), Systemaddict then puts on a display of turntable wizardry as he cuts and scratches his way through an incredible array of genres and styles.  It also features appearances from previous collaborators Dnamic (Trifecta) and Tafkapao (Ray Moody Trio).  The result is a must-hear album for any fan of hip-hop or jazz.
