,6-FigurePirate,2008-02-03T20:30Z,"what do we do when we finish DLing it? im guessing we extract all files to a single folder, but then why does it have to be in 3 parts it takes forever"
,daac9999,2008-02-10T17:23Z,"it's in 3 parts because it's easier to burn. Winrar Extracts everything if you extract the first file... Just drop everything ""program files"" folder, and run one of the .bat to run one of the games."
,spookcow,2008-02-11T06:07Z,"Is there any way to use this under Ubuntu 7:10? The Batch file does nothing under wine, and the exe gives me a mount app file system failed error..
Thank you! This kicks ass under windows"

,AtomicPunk5150,2008-07-06T17:12Z,"Hi, im having some problems. i extracted the files to C:\program files\ and ran half life 2. it seemed good 'til the blurry loading screen. after a while the ""loading"" icon disappears and nothing happens, the blurry screen just stays there. ive seen this work on another computer so, could it be that my computer does'nt have what it takes to run the game or have i done something wrong?

Thankful for answers :)  "
