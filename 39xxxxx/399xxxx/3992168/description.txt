ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN - 1976

Nominated for 8 Academy Awards. Won 4.

  Journalism thrillers just don't get any better than All the 

President's Men. Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford are 

perfectly matched as (respectively) Washington Post 

reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, whose 

investigation of the Watergate scandal led to President 

Richard Nixon's resignation. Their bestselling book was 

brilliantly adapted by screenwriter William Goldman, and 

director Alan Pakula crafted the film into one of the most 

intelligent and involving of the 1970s paranoid thrillers. 

Featuring Jason Robards in his Oscar-winning role as 

Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee, All the President's Men 

is the film against which all other journalism movies must be 

measured.
