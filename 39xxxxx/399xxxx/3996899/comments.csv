Ive been downloading your movies for 2 months and i love the work you do .i just got a iphone and uploaded some of your movies and they dont look bad on standart screen mode but on fit to screen mode you can see the pixels and this should be the same on ipod touch too. i checked your resolutions with mediainfo and it's 320x***
*** differs 188 to 240 . have you ever tries 640x*** resolution? all ipods can play it and i know that apple tv plays them too. "
