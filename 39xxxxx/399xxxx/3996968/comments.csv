,basama,2008-01-27T15:52Z,doesnÂ´t work. something wrong with RAR file
,GenyrusSeedeR,2008-02-08T00:58Z,"rar file? dont download rar files guys, or at least dont upload them. people dont tend to seed them long, because they erase the zipped file after they download. thus, no seeding"
,GenyrusSeedeR,2008-02-09T18:27Z,"i wont seed this anymore because this guy gives you fifteen tousand rar files, that you dont need. i suggest you download this movie somewhere else, from someone who knows what they are doing"
