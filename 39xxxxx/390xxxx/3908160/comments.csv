Total rubbish. Simcha Jacobovici is very biased in the doucmentary. Christians should not be suprised. This man is a hardcore Jew. At one time he was the president of the International Congress of the World Union of Jewish Students (WUJS). And he he makes no bones of his hatred for Jesus and christianity. Now a man who hates Christ can only make anti-Christ movies. So I believe Christians should not watch this rubbish that he has produced.

Secondly the documentary does a very misleading thing. Whenever it encounters a potential piece of evidence that doesn't fit into their argument, they find a way of suggesting that it could potentially fit, and then thereafter refer to it as if they've proven their point. For example, they bring up the problem of ""Mariamne"" - who could she be? Her mention in the Acts of Philip in reference to Mary Magdalene was cited as evidence that this could mean the real Mary Magdalene (never for once questioning the historical validity of the Acts of Philip). Then they show you a dramatic reconstruction of Mary Magdalene as the wife of Jesus, and from that point on, the documentary acts as if they've proven without a doubt that Mariamne is Mary Magdalene. They continue doing that with all the pieces of evidence that don't quite fit, without nothing that these evidence are all linked, so if even one of them is false, then the rest of their case falls apart. 

Christians should avoid this movie. "
,zaphodb001,2009-03-12T02:57Z,Don't you think that the above comment really counts as a rining endorsement of this film?
,maxiver,2009-04-26T10:46Z,"Yes! It does. In anycase, the person 'indianchristian' is a neoconvert & hence, no rational words are possible from him. Fanaticism is what he is made of. He is Pathetic converted pig."
