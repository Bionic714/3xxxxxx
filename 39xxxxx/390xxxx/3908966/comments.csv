,JuGGaLoKLoWn,2007-12-22T19:33Z,Is this the complete game with voices and bgm?
,Cortax,2007-12-29T06:19Z,"Hmm, It should be. I cant be sure thu as I havent played this one in a looong time and I played way to many bishoujo games to remember details about them all. But I think there is only one version of this game(either with or without). I advice you check it up on the net, should tell you there if this game comes with voice and Bgm."
,AlfyMasamune,2008-03-24T10:25Z,"Hey Cortex all your games work perfect, you got anymore?"
,Cortax,2008-04-19T15:43Z,"Got plenty more of these games but you should also check out this guys torrents

,chanman64,2008-04-27T03:29Z,"hey gabrielsgrave i'm having the same problem u had, where did u end up finding the crack?"
,rejay,2008-08-13T14:55Z,"aw crap, i'm kinda having trouble finding the crack, can anyone tell me where it is?"
,rejay,2008-08-13T14:58Z,i'm in the same shoes chanman64 is in. did all the stuff gabrielsgrave did.
,rejay,2008-08-13T15:07Z,"Great! I found the crack, thanks for the game Cortax!
BUT, there is a problem. When I start the game, it says: 

Formatting movie has failed
Playing B:\SEKIRA64.avi has failed

The game still plays afterwords, then again, I am kind of concerned if it will affect the rest of the game."
,rejay,2008-08-14T04:04Z,"Found another problem

One of the scenes with the character ""Sheena""
is broken. I tried going back and forth through saving and loading but it gives me this response:

Can not go back to sub-scenario

I knew those errors fromt he beginning would affect the rest of the game..."
,rejay,2008-08-14T08:40Z,"Oh, to be more specific. The message:

Can not go back to the sub-scenario.

Appeares during the Sheena route AFTER exactly after the scene: Try me!"
,piro2247,2008-08-14T09:57Z,"hey, im having the same problem that gabrielsgrave was having... i think its that im new to the software, i got to the install portion, but it asks for a cd, which i of course dont have. can anyone help?"
,Cortax,2008-08-21T01:47Z,"I cant say I experienced the Problem.

""Formatting movie has failed
Playing B:\SEKIRA64.avi has failed""

All I can guess at is that either the file you have is damage/corrupt or it might be you got some codec or something interfering. I havent seeded this torrent for the past 6-7-8 month or so since it had a steady number of leachers. So might also be that the current seeders has a corrupt file or something now....just guessing thu."
,skel03,2008-09-14T08:57Z,ummm... is it in english? havent tried this season before.
,skel03,2008-09-15T06:03Z,"ummm... i cant find the ""crack"" file? where can u find it? 

coz when i mount it in daemon it keeps ask for ""correct cd-rom""  sum1 help?"
,DoC.ToR,2008-11-25T04:49Z,???! How to download this game???
,TheAxis,2009-02-01T01:04Z,"I don't know if it's redundant trying to write this comment now, but I think I have ways to help most of the problems commented here so far. 

For those looking for the crack, once you've loaded the game with Daemon and done a full install (make sure you do a full install), go to my computer and right click -> explore on the drive that Daemon is emulating. The crack folder is in there. 

You can find other instructions in the NFO file in this torrent.

If your having the same problem Rejay did with the 'cant find vid' thing, there is an easy way around that. 

First, make sure you've copied the new exe from the crack folder that you found before into the folder where you installed the game.

In the root folder of the emulated cd drive, there will be an AVI file called SEKIRA64. Copy this file into the folder where you installed the game. In the crack folder you will also see a REGISTRY file. To be safe double click it while it's still in the emulated cd drive and let it do its thing (by double left clicking on the file). Then, copy it to where you installed the game, and do the same thing.  

Hopefully that helps!"
,kev200,2010-07-06T23:43Z,"chanman64 as i am only guessing havent finished torrent yet but i assume it would be in the cd dir
open ur cd in my computer and i think theres crack folder"
,MrQuackers,2010-12-30T08:18Z,"Remember guys. Dont change directories. You have to reinstall and use the registry key and crack again. Just happened to me, and I needed to.

Just a heads up."
,camson14,2011-01-22T18:31Z,i know this has been said alot and i did find the crack but i cannot copy and paste the crack because it says that there is not enough space to put the crack and i do not know where exactly to put it in the first place
,lunn1986,2011-04-21T15:38Z,Can anyone please seed this please? Thanks! =D
,mcbobinite,2011-06-02T01:23Z,what do you mount? the bin or cue file?
,Calamitous_Avatar,2012-01-07T12:05Z,"So what do I mount first, Bin or Cue? Because Bin won't work. Says it failed."
