in my opinion you will never get finished that way.
there's just not enough bandwidth to seed you all at once.
 also you can never seed back everything you have taken.
 i have seeded over 20 gigs trying to get these torrents up and that is not enough with torrents running out of seeds.
 i can just not keep up all the torrents at once. sorry something has to happen."
,carolinawolf,2007-11-26T15:08Z,"sorry but i will have to leave this torrent after i see 3 seeds. i will repost Lonesome Dove The Original  at a later time again. with the title of just Lonesome Dove.

i can not keep up all 5 torrents by myself having to keep going back and seeding all over again. 

you will only get to download one at a time, because i will only post every 5 days or so."
,carolinawolf,2007-11-26T16:04Z,"disregard the link above. i have found numerous new people just now starting to download all the torrents at once. there is not enough bandwidth to seed all the torrents at one time.
i have seeded over 20 gigs because of hit and runs. now these new people are downloading all at one time and downloading 4 gigs and seeding back only a trickle.
after most have finished they just leave with out seeding back.
each time this is done someone has to seed another 4 gigs to fill in what they have stolen.
i will repost Lonesome Dove after the ""Lonesome Dove the Original"" has 3 seeds.
if you haven't started it please don't it will be reposted at a later time as Lonesome Dove . i will only put up one every three days because of the ones that jump on all at once and then hit and run.
when they are posted you will have three days to get them, after that i will not reseed."
,carolinawolf,2007-11-26T20:17Z,"if this stops on ya look for the title ""lonesome Dove"".not Lonesome Dove The Original.  get the new torrent it should start downloading where you left off here.

it will be updated to the next eps. after three days

i have to do this because of the dummies that click on everything all at once screwing up the seeders like they will be there forever for them to USE. 
by USE i mean they never seed back everything they have downloaded.

 try one at a time and see how much faster it is in the over all downloading."
,carolinawolf,2007-11-27T00:21Z,"the new torrent for lonesome Dove is the same file but it was given a different hash mark. so it's not going to work.

I seeded this torrent on this page with over 3 gigabits my self and then there was 3 seeders for a short time.then they quit.
the bay needs to start banning these F--ing hit and runners. you can't post for the bastards."
,carolinawolf,2007-11-27T01:56Z,"Word from the bay can not create a file that already exists . so the new one just Lonesome Dove will not work. I HAVE just upped number two.
