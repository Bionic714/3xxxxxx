not that good looking on a high def screen though, but what can I expect from a DVD

,CaptainMooseInc,2008-08-20T09:00Z,"You can use a program like Alcohol 120% or Daemon Tools to ""mount"" an image (it will make a virtual drive and then the .ISO will be ""inserted"" into it. It tricks the computer into thinking there's a CD/DVD in and you can just watch it like that."
