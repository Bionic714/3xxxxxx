Death, Jr. lets you play as the teenage son of the grim reaper. Armed with a mighty scythe and an arsenal of guns and explosives, you must overcome a variety of obstacles to save the world from demons of Pandora's Box. Along the way, you'll receive help from your friends, including conjoined twins, a foul-mouthed foreign exchange student with no limbs, and the curious Pandora herself. The game mixes elements from first-person shooters and third-person platform games.
