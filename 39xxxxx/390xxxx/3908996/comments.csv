,Yureka,2007-12-13T11:40Z,will you release snow sakura too?
,X-PLODE,2007-12-13T22:57Z,"Well now that i have allot of free GB on my HD i can rip whenever i have the original game...only prob is that i don't order my hgames online and then release within a few hours, that would be suicide xD.

I usually just wait around till i have some business to do with a friend and then he gives any hgame i want. I don't even check the websites for any new games lol

So don't expect me to know wth you are talking about when you all start posting ""GIVE US MOAR SAKURA @_@"" xD"
,Yureka,2007-12-15T01:26Z,"ok lol
just to inform you Snow Sakura was released like 1 or 2 days 
Just want to keep you up to date "
