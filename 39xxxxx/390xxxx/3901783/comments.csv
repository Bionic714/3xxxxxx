,predict00,2008-02-16T11:06Z,DONT DOWNLOAD THIS IT IS A TROJAN if u do then download avg so u can see ur self.
,xdorsih,2008-02-19T00:59Z,"No offense, but AVG is a dumb bitch. Its brute force anti-virus, as in ""what is this? oh, must be a virus!"" AVG cant tell the difference between a keygen and a virus, because they operate on a slightly similar principle."
,koppoken,2008-03-19T14:07Z,Trojan according to NOD32
,r3loader,2008-03-31T11:06Z,"oh lol, trojan too..."
,valamir,2008-04-29T03:08Z,"This is a trojan, sent it to norton to look at it."
,hookerjoe,2008-06-04T06:05Z,well obviously its working for some people but not for others. The real issue is how to make it work despite avg
,Jacxx,2008-06-30T23:30Z,"NOD32 says its a virus, you can stop seeding it."
,thexboy_8,2008-07-05T15:09Z,"People, scan the file at http://www.virustotal.com/ if you want to make sure it's not a Trojan! I use it all the time as just 1 AV isn't enough to make me feel safe. I'll scan this file and post the results."
,thexboy_8,2008-07-05T15:21Z,"Virustotal results

Not sure what to make of it, it's got shit loads of positives. Someone should just post a list of 50 keys for us :-)."
,pass2daleft,2008-07-09T05:09Z,I wonder how many of u motherfuckers work for midway!?
,Sesshru,2008-10-06T00:48Z,"contains a virus, if you can open it, then obviously your virus software sucks balls and you need to update and get something newer"
,psphackerowned,2008-10-31T22:23Z,i dont give a shit if its a virus the serials work fine and have you ever thought the virus protection is picking it up because its illegal 
,MailToad,2008-12-19T15:37Z,"Seems fine, no viruses/lots of keys!"
,dlbrody69,2009-01-06T03:08Z,"Dowloaded and checked with Malwarebytes..the best scanner out there. Had a nasty virus before and nothing cought it except for it. No virus or malware here.

AVG will say anything is a virus, especially keygens"
,dlbrody69,2009-01-06T03:10Z,yeppers! no virus! works perfectly!! Thanks!
,mboatley,2009-01-08T14:56Z,check out www.serials.ws for all the software keys you could ever want. There are thousands!!!
