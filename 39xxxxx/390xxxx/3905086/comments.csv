[T],oddeven,2007-11-24T06:14Z,What can I say?
,ScorpioTiger,2007-11-25T18:05Z,Probably not much. But even though I don't think I'll download I thank you for your efforts. It's people like yourself making rare material available that makes file sharing so worthwhile.
,archmage23,2008-01-19T02:12Z,"This is one of the greatest movies i've watched...
My friend has it but i don't feel like copying it from him.. i'd rather just download it... allthough it's 6.5 GB..... but i encourage people to get this and understand it's message... the description given here is a grave understatement. I mean, oddeven, this film deserves a better introduction from you :] I can also see a connection to Waking Life... and a lot of similar movies.. can't you ?"
,wadester,2008-01-21T08:47Z,What a great resource! Thank you very much. I was wondering if you are familiar with a companion video from My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. The original videotape required the viewer to turn his television on its side to view correctly. Ive been looking for years. Is this it?
[T],oddeven,2008-01-21T12:46Z,"I don't know of a companion video, but Brian Eno made some videos that did require you to turn your TV on the side (unless you had one of those funky Mac monitors that swivvled). They were a bit Warholesque, in that they were basically a one shot sequence without much action.  You might be thinking about these:

Thursday Afternoon (1984) 
Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan (1981)
Which I will try to put up..."

,brie36,2008-05-05T18:24Z,how do you open this file because its an ISO. file? 
,-roAch-,2008-07-23T16:14Z,"@oddeven:

i have been desperate for that movie for a while,
it's hard to come by: can't even find it on the eMule network...

I would really appreciate your effort!
