Another big one...

This is a bit of a cross between Brian Eno and David Byrne's "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts" and "Baraka".  A lot of music and talking heads.  Kurt Vonnegut, Brian Eno, Tom Robbins, Asha Bhosle, etc.
It's a non-linear set-up, so you can view it in a different sequence every time.
155 minutes of stuff.
Plenty of extras on this uncompresssed NTSC iso
