,HuggliBear,2007-12-03T16:39Z,"I guess that the majority will burn this to a dvd and eventually delete it, but I wonder how? Im planning to use a dvd with double layer - 8,5 GB. can I do that?"
,Nightowl247,2007-12-03T20:36Z,"Yes HuggliBear, you can use 8,5GB DL (DVD9) to burn these DVD's to get a 1:1 copy without any quality loss ;o)"
,HuggliBear,2007-12-06T22:44Z,thanks

but if i shrink the dvds to 4.7gb does the video/sound quality  get really bad? what program should i use to get the best quality?


thanks, maxxor"
,Nightowl247,2008-01-05T17:45Z,"Hi maxxor,
I always use Nero to burn with. 
It will automaticly find out that you have inserted a DL DVD and you will have no problems burning it (PLEASE CHECK YOUR BURNER FIRST - Not all burners can burn DL).
If you want to shrink the movies DVDFab Platinum or DVD Shrink are great programs. You can select what you want to keep and what you want to leave out. The programs will tell you what percentage (quality) of the movie you have after shrinking it.
What is best? Well, that is really up to you to decide! I always prefere a DVD9 over a DVD5!
If a torrent has more languages included you can get quite a good quality by only taking the one language or audio codec (ex. 5.1 stereo) you need. But this torrent (Las Vegas) only has english 5.1 and it will not bring you much to skip the 3 subs you do not need as subtitles do not take up much space. By shrinking this torrent you will loose quality for sure!
If you find the DL DVDs too expensive (check online shops first!) I think it is possible to split a DVD9 into two DVD5s with DVDFab Platinum. 
But I do not have any experience how you do that.

""Seed it well and season 2 could be up soon ....."" Like now??? :P"
,Nightowl247,2008-04-12T19:27Z,"@ozi,
well I have season 2+3 which I could upload if people would be willing to help seeding. And by seeding I mean a ratio ABOVE 1 ! I had a ratio above 20, when I removed season 1 from my hd. Take a look at the number of seeders and do the math yourself. This place should be for people who want to share on an equal basis. Just click on the names who have left comments to this torrent and you will find that not ONE single one of them have uploaded anything at all.
Then why should I even bother .....???
If you have a crappy connection or your hd is two small, then do NOT download dvd's! 
Stay with AVI or do a serious upgrade of your hardware and connection or even go out and BUY the movies. Oh yes, we are still a few who do that!"
