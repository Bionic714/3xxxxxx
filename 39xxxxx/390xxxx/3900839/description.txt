a 13 min. documentary on possibly why meat is not healthy for us to eat.  personally, i do eat some meat, though does anyone still believe that cows shot up with steroids and hormones are what the human body processes as a 'healthy' consumption?  don't be vegan or vegetarian if you don't want to; but perhaps watch a disturbing video for a moment, and justify for yourself why you are consuming something that hurts your body when other replacement sources of calories, protein, vitamins and minerals are readily available...

format: AVI

length: 13min.

quality: ok, i don't believe all of what this narrator states, and i do think that some meat is needed, and necessary.  cutting back is perhaps the partial answer.  watch and defend your views maybe...
