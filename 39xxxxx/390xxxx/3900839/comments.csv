If your not a Vegan and just think of cutting back on the meat, Why upload those Ultravegans
propaganda movies all the time??"
,spacey1,2007-11-22T00:02Z,"because i make my own decisions instead of listening to angry, immmature internet commenters.  meat consumption doesn't determine health; ever heard of heart disease?  (you probably will)"
,bbabe,2007-12-20T22:52Z,"why anyone would defend eating something that is  full of antibiotics, steriods and growth hormone is stupidity redefined.  ever wonder why the infertility rate in north america has increased substantially over the past few decades?  it's because of what's been put into the dairy and meat you consume.  
Eat meat and dairy at your own peril.

Go vegan and live long and prosper!

though i never say the word props...
it's all about health, look up how to combine the triangle of grains, legumes, and protein."
,spacey1,2008-03-04T12:34Z,"eating 'white' meat, like turkey, white-chiken, and fish (w/ no mercury) is a great alternative to red-meat.  

we are not cavemen anymore, and it is important to decide what we put in our bodies if you care about your heart and intestines.

i worked with a 300 lb. 40 yr. old man at my work who has just gone the the hospital to have part of his intestines removed because he was so overweight.  It was because of that type of lifestyle.

if you like meat, i would suggest organic meat (even beef, though it costs more), but i eat soy products that taste like meat.

make your own decision..."
