The resolution is really low, the image is extremely pixelated, the colors are washed out, each file is only 100 MB, and there are black widescreen bars stored in the actual file so the video ends up looking really funny when you try to fullscreen it.

If you want to download the whole season I would recommend downloading a torrent which is at least twice this big (the rar compression doesn't do jack... why do people even bother compressing already compressed videos???)."
