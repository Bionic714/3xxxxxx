,Osaka,2008-02-17T20:24Z,"Could someone please rip Swagger and Drunken Lullabies in EAC with Secure Mode and put them up as FLAC or APE, complete with extraction logs and cue's (unless they're already splitted into individual files)....!? 

I've been trying to find them, no luck, even tried eMule - lol
