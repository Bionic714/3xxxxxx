Excellent suspense movie. This one probably disappeared among the "Guns of Navarone" imitators during the 60's. A pity, since it is worth having a look at. Some points in its favor: "Unpredictable" - characters who usually don't die in movies like this die unexpectedly and in unexpected order (it doesn't follow the clich√©s). The spies sent on undercover missions into Germany are actually forced to speak German, and various ruses to cover up the accents have to be made.
