For all you Die Hard fans; this is not an action movie. It's a documetary dealing with the german invation of Crete 1941-1945. Made in 2005, it's rather good.

From the cover: "Whith dramatic re-creations and over 20 veterans interviewed from Crete, England, Australia and New Zealand, including Leigh Fermor himself, The 11th Day is a heart-pounding adventure story about courage, faith and heroism... a story that is all the more remarkable because it is history"
