Coast to Coast - George Noory w/ David Icke 11/20/2007

Global Conspiracy
Author and speaker David Icke returned for a discussion on his new work on the 'Global Conspiracy.' This conspiracy goes back thousands of years, he said: At one time there was a global society of great advancement, but after a cataclysm ended their golden age, they were split into isolated groups. From these various groups, "divine" bloodlines emerged, assuming the "right to rule."

The Illuminati keep people under control via the chemical poisoning of the food supply, and eventually plan to microchip the entire population for complete external control, he outlined. However, he noted that people can break free by not identifying with the "body computer" or five senses. "We've forgotten that we're an expression of infinite consciousness," and become identified with "the small instead of the all," said Icke.

In the 2008 election, both Giuliani and Hillary Clinton are Illuminati candidates-- "puppets of the hidden force," he declared, adding that Hillary is a particularly powerful figure in the Illuminati.
