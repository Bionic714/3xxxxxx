,mrfr0g,2008-11-17T14:51Z,"What retard made this archive???!

The FLIC file formats is known as the extension .FLI and .FLC, used to store animation files. It is similar to animated GIF.

The FLIC animation format was originally developed by Autodesk for use with Autodesk Animator (FLI) and Autodesk Animator Pro (FLC).

WHY THE HELL DID SOMEONE CREATE A RAR ARCHIVE USING THIS FORMAT?!

Seriously, whats wrong with people?

Sorry for the anger. But using the flc format like in this way is similar to using a bucket of shit as a cap."
,Baloo2,2008-12-13T01:51Z,"The good thing is, the quality is rather good.

The bad thing (for non-Swedish viewers) is that the Swedish subtitles are hardcoded into the AVIs.

And I agree, mrfr0g, RAR-ing the files, and then give the package the wrong extension really wasn't a good idea.

And for a trusted uploader, the file info really sucks. Here's some info (based upon my concatenated two AVI files that makes up the pilot).
