Thanks PPKLP!

Maybe i'll upload my splitted version of Alive 97. I just don't know how to name a few of the songs. They are Da Funk, Rollin' & Scratchin' and Alive. The rest is improvisation."
,chilledoutuk,2007-11-21T17:46Z,"I downloaded the 320kbps version off newsgroups but i noticed that the transitions were cut out meaning the tracks would end early and start late. 

I have the Japan version thats one complete file.

Is the cd thats being sold in Europe in track form or is that being done by the rippers?

I don't mind it being cut up but having the continuity ruined but trimming the tracks is pointless.

,DemonWizard,2007-11-21T17:59Z,"The one i splitted (from the Japanese version), the 320kb one from PPKLP and the this one are perfect. No silence has been add to the end of each track. So they will play with no gaps. 

If you use Winamp, this plugin may help: http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details/107818

There are other two there, but i think this is the better (v0.7.2)."
,chilledoutuk,2007-11-22T00:54Z,"I think you misunderstand what i mean.

The japan edition is one complete track of the whole show.

whereas this release is from a source that has the show in track form. 

The problem i have is that the tracks have been trimed for example if you listen to the end of the first track it finishes abrubtly and then when the next track starts it goes straight into the song as though they have edited out a couple of seconds of the crowd in between the songs.

if this is what it is like on the cd then the studio did a butcher job on it and i must have to get the japan version in lossless without any discontinuity."
,DemonWizard,2007-11-22T02:09Z,"Ah, now i got it.

I don't know which one you downloaded, but this release and the other one from PPKLP (320k) are ok.

The one iÂ´ve splitted is ok too, but i did that because at that time we didn't have the oficial version with tracks. Now mine is obsolete. Download the ones from PPKLP."
,chilledoutuk,2007-11-24T11:30Z,"ok apologises it seems it was winamp being gay i have  switched the pre track buffer on and now changes are instant and without gap like mix cd's

cheers for this release."

,aphrospice,2008-05-02T22:41Z,Thank you! I downloaded this off of Soulseek at a 192 and was very disappointed that it didnt play well on my Bose at almost full volume. But this one is like being right there! Marry me?!
,daftpunka,2009-01-24T19:09Z,Thanks much. I've been looking for this in FLAC format for quite some time.
