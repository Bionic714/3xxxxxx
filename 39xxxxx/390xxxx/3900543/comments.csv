,Minerva.TheGift,2007-11-27T16:28Z,"Thanks for the upload, and for all of your other HDTV uploads!  I opened up the main file, and it looks beautiful! That 720p fills up a widescreen monitor very nicely ;) I've spot checked the clip for accuracy, but I haven't watched the whole thing (because I saw it live last week) but a friend wanted me to dl this for them.  Thanks again!  I'll try to seed to 1.000 share ratio, but it's a bit harder now since this is a week old and many diehard fans already have it :P"
