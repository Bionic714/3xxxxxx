,aaron82,2007-11-22T16:35Z,great cd.but the one i downloaded the second cd has 17 tracks for some reason.just wondering if its an offical track.
,ANP_,2007-11-22T20:29Z,"Been waiting for days now...finally! :D A great quality rip also!

Thanks a lot!"
,iPirate_123,2007-11-22T20:49Z,Downloading right now!
,BlackSliver,2007-11-23T01:38Z,"aaron82, look at amazon. The second disc contains only 16 tracks. If it sounds like halo, its maybe a H1 or H2 track or maybe its some ingame rip?

Also theres one track i miss: http://youtube.com/watch?v=biw2yiglKcc"

,hezekiah957,2007-11-23T06:52Z,"According to wiki, track 17 is the winner of a competition, and very much official.  Guess I'll grab this, then get it (LvUrFR3NZZ) from another release..."
,BlackSliver,2007-11-24T13:08Z,"Would any1 like to rapid share the 17th track or post the torrent?
Its very very strange that the track is missing on my disc..."

,Kurazz,2007-12-02T00:23Z,"Thanks alot BlackSliver for the Soundtrack!

As a side note, the so called 17th track is not a track on this soundtrack.  It can, however, be found on the first Halo soundtrack.  It is located at the end of the ""Halo"" track."

,ppahv,2010-05-02T10:06Z,Is there any FLAC version ?
,Dwarg91,2010-05-31T20:28Z,Thank you for this torrent it was of real help to me because my disk was messed up.
,Screamokid,2010-12-20T12:50Z,"ppahv - Why the hell would you want FLAC? It's just an uncompressed piece of crap that can't be played by anything except probably like 1 program, plus because it's uncompressed, it takes up like 10 times more than a standard 128kbs MP3. Even if I wanted anything above 320kbs for listening to music, I'd take WMA lossless file because it's the same thing but the codec is actually known to more music players."
