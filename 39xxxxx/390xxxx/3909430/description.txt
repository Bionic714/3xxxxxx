This is a Demonoid torrent rescue; the DHT-enabled .torrent file has been edited to include new trackers, without altering the hash-number. Presence of either seeds or even peers is not guaranteed, and it may take a long time to acquire the material.

If someone else could locate the .torrent file for disk 3 and upload it (after renaming it to match this set), it would be HIGHLY appreciated.

If you downloaded disk 3 awhile ago, check (on a PC, with uTorrent)...
Documents and Settings > (account-name) > Application Date > uTorrent
...and see if there's an old copy of "Cadillacs and Dinosaurs" in there. Make a backup, then open in a text-editor to make sure it's disk 3. If so, rename it to "Cadillacs and Dinosaurs DVD 3of4 TVrip cartoon collection", and upload it here.

***Use of uTorrent 1.7.5+ or Azureus 3+ is HIGHLY recommended with this torrent. Do NOT disable peer-exchange or DHT!***
