,benihana856,2007-11-22T20:32Z,Thanks a ton. I was super excited that you didn't include the campfire headphase since i already have it.
,mini1337,2007-11-23T21:45Z,"Glad you enjoyed it. My Campfire Headphase version wasn't the BoC, so I left it out. Not one of my favourite albums anyways...

If you ever here of a legit copy of Hooper Bay or any older BoC coming out, let me know."

,3Dom,2008-05-25T09:50Z,"mini1337 rocks! thanks. by the way, the BoC Campfire Headphase does indeed kick ass. You simply need the BoC version. Peacock tail and Dayvan Cowboy are two of my favourite Boards tracks."
