This has to be one of the most off the wall offering's of smut sadism and L.S.D popping party heaven.

Wanda the sadistic Hypnotist is a confusing film but that is half the fun. And its produced and distributed by the Meister of filth Harry Novak himself.

Wanda finds an accident victim and basically has some nasty ole punishments up her sleeve for the unfortunate victim, she's a Olga and Ilsa rolled together on a bad day, and thats saying something.

Wanda loves her chains and L.S.D, and what can make a better party than a sadistic swinging set up!

A little known "counter culture classic" replete with "L.S.D Freak-out" scenes with the Obligatory laughing faces and body paints, a classic
