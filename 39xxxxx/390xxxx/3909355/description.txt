This musical horror/comedy tells the story of a group of old Bible thumpers who fight to get The Sunny Buttocks Nudist Camp shut down. After the judgment that the camp is to be shut down and given to the church, the pissed off nudists make a pact to curse the land of all those that are religious, and proceed to commit a mass suicide. Years later a group of teens is sent to the now renamed camp, Camp CutchaGuzzOut for a religious retreat. The nudists return determined to kill every last zealot. Can the campers sing and dance their way to safety, or will the zombies sing and dance the campers into the ground?

I went into this movie not expecting much at all. This was a nice surprise. By no means is this an award winning film, but this is the kind of movie that you get your friends together with a few brewskies and kick back and enjoy. The songs are absolutely hilarious. Also, you get a ton of funny-ass dialogue. ?With phrases like ?Remember, the children can't praise the Lord if they've got genitals in their mouths.?, ?They?ll come back pissing Holy Water?, and ?Well, Jesus must love hemorrhoids because he sure got a lot of assholes behind him.?, how can you go wrong?

And you get names like Judge Rhinehole, Mrs. Druple (you?ll understand why this is funny after viewing it), Peter Trickle (a nudist), Billy McRighteous, Mrs. Mammarosa, and Fanny Wype, just to name a few. As I mentioned, how could you go wrong. Frickin? hilarious!
