I found another source, and now I'm seeding this up.  There are currently 24 seeders, so this is for the time being a healthy torrent again (and yes, I want a cookie!  :p)

PLEASE don't stop seeding if you see a bunch of peers at over 99% and you're the only remaining seed, its happened to me so many times and it just blows."
