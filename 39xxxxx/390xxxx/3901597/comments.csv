,samp127,2009-11-22T09:26Z,"download BitComet http://www.bitcomet.com/
if i was you i would make yourself a Username (slightly faster downloads) (and the more you download/upload/stay online, the better your rank, the faster your download speeds. but also the higher the seeders the faster the download speeds. any way after installing BitComet (you could use Limewire/BitTorrent(SLOW)/uTorrent etc.) but whatever. click download this torrent up near the top.... and it should ask to open with,, choose your torrent software and download, i would leave it for about 1 / 2 hours depending on size.... unless your reaching 100/500 kbps... when it has finished copy files to My Music/Music folder and copy over to iTunes or sumthin. anymore questions,, just ask."
