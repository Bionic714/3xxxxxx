Timeline: Child benefits records loss
Chancellor Alistair Darling has told the House of Commons that two CDs containing personal details of 25m people have been lost.

Here is a look at events at HM Revenue and Customs leading to the statement on Tuesday.

MARCH 2007

A junior official at HM Revenue and Customs gives the National Audit Office a full copy of HMRC's child benefit data, in breach of security procedures. That information is later safely returned.

SEPTEMBER

Records of about 15,000 people's details go missing after being sent by HMRC to Standard Life. Also in September, a laptop containing around 400 ISA (individual savings accounts) customers' details is stolen.

18 OCTOBER

Child benefit data is again sent to the NAO by a junior official, using the courier company TNT, which operates the HMRC's post system. The package containing two CDs, containing details of 25 million individuals, is not recorded or registered and fails to arrive.

24 OCTOBER

The NAO tells HMRC it has not received the package. An HMRC spokeswoman said the official believed it may have been delayed by the postal strikes or in the NAO's office move and did not report it. A second copy is sent, again in breach of procedures, but this time it is sent by registered post and arrives safely.

8 NOVEMBER

Senior HMRC management are informed that the 18 October package is missing.

10 NOVEMBER

Alistair Darling is informed and tells Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Mr Darling orders an immediate investigation and searches of all premises where the package might be, as well as action to ensure it does not happen again.

12 NOVEMBER

Mr Darling is told by HMRC that evidence has been found which might help to find the missing package.

14 NOVEMBER

The chancellor decides the HMRC searches have failed and tells HMRC chairman Paul Gray to call in the Metropolitan Police.

15 NOVEMBER

The chancellor goes to Information Commissioner Richard Thomas, who agrees that remedial action must be taken before a public statement is made.

12-18 NOVEMBER

Mr Gray tells Mr Darling he feels he should resign. The chancellor seeks the advice of the Financial Services Authority and Serious Organised Crime Agency, while banks are alerted by HMRC.

20 NOVEMBER

Mr Gray resigns following an announcement that Mr Darling is to make a statement to the House of Commons. The chancellor outlines what has happened and announces an investigation of HMRC's security procedures by PricewaterhouseCoopers chairman Kieran Poynter, alongside the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which monitors the HMRC.
