,thehandshakedrugs,2007-11-23T02:33Z,"well Oblivion, It's nice to of you to give your expert opinion about the quality of a download that you haven't downloaded yourself. 

and regarding your talk about quality loss and compression...  do you extract them and compress them a lot, like a thousand times a day? do you do that to all your downloads?  

well, thanks for the upload and good seeding guy's
"
,Oblivion_4,2007-11-23T07:24Z,"good movie! it works.

Krutok compressing an audio or video file with winrar will cause audio/vidoe files to lose their overall quality, because winrar is not a lossless compression. I am not trying to insult you just trying to educate you. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression

It's not my fault I am an audio/visual freak. I guess I should be thankful to He0n though because this movie won't even be officially released for another four days so......

You ohers crack me up, the endless child-like attacks on each other. And then people wonder why the US is at war, why so much crime.. etc
You really need look no further than these comments to see man at his best/worst."
,seldon131,2007-11-24T03:25Z,"Ok, lets clear this up. The splitting the file up thing is related to newsgroups, any recent program to handle rars can handle multi part ones with no extra effort on your part, click the first one and it'll open the whole thing.

As for winrar being lossy, no. Absolutely not. If winrar were lossy, what would happen when you rar up a program? There aren't bits in executable files that you can toss away like with music or video. When you rar something, even if you split it into 300 parts, it will come back exactly the same way, zero change, bit for bit.

Now, back to futurama, my head hurts."
,drunkb,2007-11-24T05:01Z,"How can there be so many friggen morons on a site like this? I would have thought most people here were more computer literate than this. RAR is  a LOSSLESS format!

Just because it has different compression levels doesn't mean it isn't lossless. It just means the algorithms compress better,  but it takes longer to compress or decompress for higher compression rates.

The output for ANY compression level zip is bit for bit identical to the original NO LOSS! The only difference is how long it will take to compress or uncompress.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't *think* that video files get smaller when you rar them. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure of that.

And cutting them into pieces? I *Really* don't get that, like what's the point? And not just video files either, why would you split *anything* into pieces? Does it make it download faster or something? I dunno.

Anyway, if it works that's all that matters so I'll stop bitching and download it, lol."
,Sanguin69,2008-10-31T23:05Z,"arata75: The reason movie and game releases are split into several smaller files is because of transfer errors.
Before a release reaches a torrent site it has first gone through several FTP-sites and the file transfer protocol, unlike torrents, doesn't have a built in CRC-check. This means that if a transfer error occurs, the whole file has to be resent. So if you were to send a whole movie as one file and it got messed it up in the transfer, you'd have to start all over again. 
When you download a torrent, it too actually splits up the file into several smaller pieces and calculates a CRC for each piece before it's transferred. The CRC is then checked by the recieving party to verify the contents. It's all built in into the program and transparent to the user. 
FTP-sites on the other hand is old-school and relies on an sfv-file, which you will often see accompanying releases. This file contains a hash for all the files that are being transmitted and is used, like a torrent, to check the data recieved to verify the transfer was error free.

There are several good reasons why FTP-sites are used higher up in the food chain, but I think this is enough technical talk for one day.

If you don't know what CRC is, look up ""cyclic redundancy check"" or ""hash function"" on wikipedia.

You're kind of right about the compression though. Movies don't get a lot smaller when RARed as they are allready compressed as they are, but you do save a little space and it's a good, standard way of splitting up the files."

Its the newsgroups that distribute in rar files, you download each rar as a binary stream. Because I'm pretty sure the newsgroup protocols aren't written for large file transfer it gets split up, and each is checked with a hash (also, CRC is outdated crap, MD5 is the shiznit for file verification at least)"
