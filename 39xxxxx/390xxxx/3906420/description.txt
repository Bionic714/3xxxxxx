I Ripped These Off Vinly LPs and Love Them A Lot, Specially The Judith Blegen With Gerald Schwartz. This Has Never Been Put Out In CD and when the Vinyl LPs Die Then The Music Dies Because The Corporate Entity Wont Issue Them In CD Probably Becaause of The Legal Crap.	Enjoy and Please Comment so i know this is up because this is one of my first cracks at setting up a Torrent...someone give me some applause if this thing shows up on here.
