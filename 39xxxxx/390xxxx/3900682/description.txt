This film was actually on the video nasties list in the UK back in the 80s (British DVD releases might still be cut). There?s one scene where a naked woman is murdered in which she gets a certain amount of blood on her breasts, which was always a big no-no as far as the BBFC were concerned (where the blood is meant to be coming from is unclear). The rest of the deaths are brilliantly inept, and include a great, bad eye-popping and a fabulous, completely unconvincing head-being-ripped off

It?s every parent?s worst nightmare. Imagine you?re a surgeon. Imagine your beloved son has some kind of ill-defined but fatal heart condition.

I know what you?re thinking: ?Transplanting the heart of an ape into the body of a young man sounds like a *great* idea. What could *possibly* go wrong?
