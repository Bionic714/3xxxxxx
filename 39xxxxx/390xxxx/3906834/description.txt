So the story goes, the bassist and guitarist of Humanifesto were discussing how NOFX's Fuck The Kids EP is one of the best things they ever did, but how it would have been so much cooler if it'd been super political, like most old-school punk of that style. 

A few days later, the bassist shows up to rehearsal with new lyrics for all 13 songs from the original NOFX EP, and a little while later, the band entered the studio for one 6-hour recording session and emerged with the product you're about to download.

Covering topics ranging from Rwanadan genocide to homophobia, shitty pop-punk to veganism, and a whole lot more, this is 9 1/2 minutes of pure old-school political punkrock.

The band even got Fat Mike's thumbs up after sending him a copy of the recording. So here it is. The torrent includes all 13 mp3s, the full lyricsheet, and the album artwork.
