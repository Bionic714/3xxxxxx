I wonder who gave you the unholy idea of coding this in VOB format??? Ripping DVDs is all well and good, but you should have taken the SECOND STEP  TOO! Which is storing it in normal, regular AVI format. This, you can do you without visible quality loss. 
I mean OH MY F0 ..CK ...NG GOD
29.5 GIGA is in this crappy format, this could be reduced to 20 to 25 percent of the size. A normal MV should be no more than 50 MB maybe 60 if it's long.
Good software is ALLOK converter, get it here!?
Be of good cheer. 

PS reducing it will be good to you, about 22.5 GIGA good and good to the bandwidth. You can also go and spent 50 euros on a external HDD ... ;)"

[V],thegoldman,2008-11-06T14:24Z,"Hi, thanx everyone for the torrents...

Well guys, personally I feel VOBs are for extreme quality and they look good only in original DVDs ;-) , but yes, I will still say that it's a good idea to upload them in their original form so that we can encode them ourselves as per our requirements. 

So I want to thank bluebrian for this torrents and guys, what ""zploek"" is trying to say is correct too, we can save disk space by properly converting it to AVI format without any significant loss in quality (but yes, he must be a little polite in his way of talking)....

So guys, I am going to download some songs and remove that black bars (if any) and re-upload them soon on TPB. I promise I will do that. I have all the proper tools and everything else to encode the videos...

Just one thing I would like to ask you all people... Which is the resolution best supported for you? 4:3 is better or 16:9 is better for you???

And what if the song looks better in 4:3 like Britney Spears - Break the Ice is better suited for 4:3 screen? 

If you can answer these questions, then please answer them else I am anyway going to convert at some great resolutions, quality you will definitely love...

I suggest you to check some of my torrents and feel free to criticize (but yes, a bit politely) and I will re-encode some videos of this torrent in the same quality...

thanx everyone for this torrent..."
