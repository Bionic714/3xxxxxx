,prisoner.of.the.dark.sky,2007-11-26T17:19Z,I donÂ´t think this half-nigger is for real and this torrent is not genuine..
,sonnybr,2007-11-26T22:43Z,"the torrent is real but I can only seed at night (9:00pm ~ 11pm GMT). I hope other people will get 100% soon so the torrent can download faster.

Btw, this ""half-nigger"" only decided to create this torrent because I think this is a fantastic movie and hard to find and I wanted other people to have it too.

So, take it or leave it. "

,Lord_Asriel,2007-12-12T23:59Z,"Hey, why is the movie format was split in 2 and also it was flip upside? What shall i do? I'd really want to watch it..."
,samsungrg,2008-04-21T04:10Z,"A somewhat weak and rubbishy religious storyline. How awful and decadent secular Western civilization truly is. Oooh casual sex.... sinful. Find your salvation you unbelievers. Repent!!!

Kill infidels and Jews and collect rivers of honey and 72 virgins NOW."
,samsungrg,2008-04-21T04:23Z,"Oh, and this movie sucks! Not enough of Mimi's tits on show for my liking.

And for the record... I'd rather live in a neighbourhood full of hedonist ""free-love"" bed swapping swingers any day than live in one full of self-righteous anally-retentive god botherers, or beardy-weardy Jew hating 'Mooslum' terrorist lovin' koranimals."
,Dr_Theopolis,2008-08-31T19:39Z,"To those of you who misakenly thought that this was supposed to be a ""pro"" religious film, all I can say is that I don't think that you watched all the way to the end. samsungrg specifically. You were absoulutely right about it having a ""weak and rubbishy religious storyline"". That is exactly what the film is trying to illustrate: That religion is a weak storyline full of rubbish. The TRULY disturbing part is that this film is 100% acurate in depicting the absurdity of what christians actually believe. I don't want to give any spoilers but the story is not complete until the very last second of the movie."
,Dsterf,2009-10-25T16:44Z,"The Rapture is the ridiculous notion of the Christian End Times.  

This is a predication of the events leading up to the earth?s demise, and the 2nd coming of Christ.  The rapture story is cobbled together with pieces culled from many different sections of the bible, and glued together in an attempt to create some kind of sequence of events.  

As just another Armageddon fable, the Rapture doctrine is a total crock?

The movie demonstrates this very well.  It is certainly not pro-Christian.

This film is likely to offend bible thumpers, and please free thinkers.  Stay with the film to the last 30 seconds, it is worth it.

The only thing wrong with this flick is that Mimi Rogers wears way too many clothes for a swinger?"
,DaveT1081,2010-08-28T21:00Z,Seems to command a lot of attention from people you'd think wouldn't give a rat's ass...
,biblecodereader,2011-05-16T14:36Z,picture good  sound good...video portrays Christianity in a negative light... it twists the truth and presents believers as deluded idiots... A demonic video at best... For the truth.. check out Chuck Missler on you-tube.
