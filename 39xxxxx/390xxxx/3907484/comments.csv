The team suite edition is for cutting egde software developers, architechts, testers only not for you knockelheads not knowing how to install a program.

By the way the team suite costs about 20 000 dollars. and there are maybe, maybee! 10 developers beside me who even know how to use it here on this site."

,SmallMatchSellingLighter,2009-04-12T17:11Z,"How I had to install: I simply double-clicked on the rar file in that list of rar's (zmvss2k8.rar) and it unzipped to show an iso file (zmvss2k8.iso).
I didn't have disks so I simply extracted the ISO to a temp directory in my documents. I then double-clicked setup and it went without a hitch....  NO PROBLEMS HERE,  works great and no 90 day warning!!!!!   Full version,, Not trial    AWSOME!!!!!!"
