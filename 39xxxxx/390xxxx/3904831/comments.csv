,bizzybody,2009-04-05T10:04Z,There are subs out there on the intarwebs. ;) Someone should collect them all for NGE Renewal and post a torrent for the whole lot in one download.
,bizzybody,2009-04-05T10:11Z,"P.S. The original DVD Renewal set has no subtitles and only Japanese audio, so any NGE Renewal sub files are fansubs. http://www.mania.com/neon-genesis-evangelion-renewal-evangelion-dvdbox_article_75523.html"
