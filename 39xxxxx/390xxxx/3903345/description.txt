Quality documentary about the 1939 winter war between Finland and Soviet Union.

Its mostly english. The few lines that there are in finnish I have translated in subs.

Worth watcing if interested in war history.

Quote from doc "There is a known case where a finnish soldier stopped an enemy tank with a crowbar".
