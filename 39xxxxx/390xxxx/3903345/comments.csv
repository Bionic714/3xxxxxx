By the way, it seems like your torrent about the Danish/Norwegian front is gone."
,timant1,2007-11-22T02:01Z,Try it again now. I had to make different torrents about these for private trackers and seems that I there is some problem in some of them im working on it now. I uploaded it again and will seed.

,timant1,2007-11-23T22:03Z,"Maybe it gave a bit too much ""room""so to speak for that womans puukko thing but when they were fighting  in trenches there was a lot of hand to hand combat. Of course ""puukko"" was just one tool one could use, more propably soldier used his rifle to hit enemy in a situation like that.

The whole ""puukko"" thing is just a american (and elsewhere too) stereotype about every finnishman having one in his pocket all the time. Urban legend like all finnish people are born in sauna etc."

This doc. had quite a lot media hype around it when it came about 2 years ago. That was because it was made by americans and it was targeted to american audience. I think that explains why the productional values are much better than historical ones.

If you want to watch doc. about Talvisota with more focus on strategy of warfare try this one:
