,johndmes,2007-11-22T18:14Z,"@lorenzox -
Guess you've been hiding under a rock.
This is one of three expansion packs to Codemaster's Overlord.

This one adds single-player content (a new campaign)."

,Jatga,2008-07-05T12:08Z,"Okay, I have the same problem that the game starts but when the minions come it crashes, without any error. So I tried running orginal Overlord, but it crashes too, BUT it didn't crashs before, until I installed 1.4 patch... so I'm going to uninstall and re-install but I close my network so it can't upgrade don't know if that helps, but I don't know anything else...  So Help please, If you got anything better..."

,IBob000,2008-08-02T21:02Z,Do I need the origional for this?
,killller54,2008-10-13T23:19Z,"i'd like to tell u 1 thing. it works, but still, the official version for the PC comes out at 14 nov, and the one that's out is for PS3. it still works for the PC, but i don't know, if the expansion content works. nice torrent, btw a little slow, but still. i guess i'm the only seeder :)"
,killller54,2008-10-14T14:29Z,"well, i played through the game, and guess what, there was ABSOLUTELY NO CONTENT of the expansion: Rising hell. i had the original game before, and played through it to the end, and i tried this game with the finished, and a new one, and beither had any signs of the abyss portals."
,killller54,2008-10-15T18:54Z,"no, scratch my latest comment. it seems that i accidentally checked the release dates of the console and PC versions wrong, as i thought the PC will be released at 14 nov 2008, but it was actually released at 14nov 2007. sry again, a simple misunderstanding. 

but i still can't see any of the raising hell expansion features. no abyss, what-so-ever "
