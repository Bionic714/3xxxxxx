,Lorthazar,2007-11-30T11:27Z,Thank you so much for this. I have been looking to back up most of my books for some time now and this is just what I needed. DLing is a bit slow but I plan to seed when I am done to help others.
,chaosmastr,2007-12-01T04:29Z,"I love what you have and will seed for along time for others.  I was wondering if you had the original ""Beyond the Supernatural?""  I've been looking for it for a long time.  Keep up the good work."
,Lorthazar,2007-12-01T09:04Z,Sorry don't have Beyond the Supernatural one of the ones i have been searching for as well.
