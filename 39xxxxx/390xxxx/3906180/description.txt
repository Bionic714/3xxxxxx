Hey all! V1.0
Over the years, I've collected nearly all the Palladium books, and nearly all of the PDFs. This is my collection, including a few custom made character sheets. This is unfortunately, not all of them, and two of them kinda suck, but it's the most comprehensive collection I've seen on the net. If you've got either a better file than I've got, or a file that I'm missing, please feel free to share it with me and I'll add it to the list!
