,bubs521,2008-03-14T03:16Z,please seed !!!!!!
,TYHThanatos,2008-07-12T20:17Z,"if this is supposed to be season 1, 2, and 3 it is crap imo...
you can't squeeze some 45 episodes into anything less than twice this torrents size....
that said, I have not watched any of these episodes (and more than likely neither has the person reading this, else they wouldn't be downloading all 3 seasons at once) so there may be less than 15 episodes per season...."
,TYHThanatos,2008-07-12T20:19Z,"okay, my last statement said....there are 10, 12, and 15 episodes in each season respectively and they are all 230mb...unless these episodes are less than 40 minutes long (though shouldn't they be a full hour if they are commerical free) it still isn't that good...."
,MisterPlumBer,2008-07-19T15:38Z,seed plz:D
,TYHThanatos,2008-07-22T07:50Z,"bah...I apologize for my incompetence...the episodes are only 30 minutes long so they are, in fact, good quality...

I am still downloading season 3 but I will upload 15 kb/s (not much, i know, but it is all I have to spare with all the other tv shows I am seeding) for then next 6 months or so...."
,sterls27,2008-09-04T02:39Z,Outstanding quality!!  Definitely worth the download.  And thanks a TON!
