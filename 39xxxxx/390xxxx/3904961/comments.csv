,0.0.0.,2008-01-25T07:38Z,"I would be cautious of this download. Run Adaware SE 2007 and find Win32.Trojan.Agent. Google Search on Dangermouse1964 seems to indicate that uploader is an ok guy but, 'something ain't right here. This is only an opinion, and that ain't worth shit. No offense Danger, maybe your off'ng has been tampered with. This is an .exe file and key does work, and program works. Danger, if your such a newbie, Mac user, how did you upload such a motherfucker!?  Aw hell, this 'll all cost a nickel a click after awhile anyway."
,Dangermouse1964,2008-02-11T15:50Z,This has not been tampered with at all and contains no nasty stuff everything i upload is 100% quality whats the point puttin shite on to give yourself a bad name and just because i am a newbie uploadin is a doddle and its a pc not mac
