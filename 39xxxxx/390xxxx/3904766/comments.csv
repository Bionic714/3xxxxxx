,Notcow,2007-11-27T04:37Z,"alright! thanks...
so this is all of the clothes from thesimsresource.com?"
,SilverArrows,2007-12-09T22:14Z,"No, it's not all the clothes from TSR. It's windkeeper's buy mode objects from TSR. I thought that was obvious from the title."
,wenylady,2008-01-10T00:26Z,Thanks you. Do the members make it a pay item or the site? I could never fig that out. I know some people post there stuff in torrents along with TSR. 
,SilverArrows,2008-01-10T22:31Z,"I'm not sure, I think the FAs do have the option to make some items free. As far as I'm aware, the FAs @ TSR get paid by how many premium downloads they get, so it makes sense for them to charge for as many items as possible. Although they only get a very tiny percent of TSR's profits. According to NeptuneSuzy about $500/year, whereas TSR makes well over $1m in profit every year.

But yes the featured artists are complicit, as TSR offers them money in return for providing pay content."
