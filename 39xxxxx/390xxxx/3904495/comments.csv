Is the same torrent, but it has more seeders.

You didn't even removed the nfo."

I just hope that you (rubychichi) and everyone else just enjoys this great record, and i don't really need to take credit for it. But next time:
- make sure you change the Filesize
- remove the NFO file
- change the comment field in the ID3-tag.

LOL...."
