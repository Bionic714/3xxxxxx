,stavrokaps,2007-11-28T17:41Z,It gets stuck on 60.4! PLEASE SEED I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO DOWNLOAD THIS!!
[T],Dark_Swordsman,2007-12-08T20:04Z,"oh i can put it in iso, i didnt realize. but you didnt have to be ignorant about it and use fould language, but hell i work in a place where we all say hi by flipping each other off anyway too."
[T],Dark_Swordsman,2007-12-08T20:09Z,"i will be posting an ISO soon, but for those of you who downloaded this already, all you have to do is open the nrg with Alcohol virtual drive and when you get inside, you can copy all the files and the installation files and everything.
this was made into a nrg because i had a game drive software that i used to make it that way. i had no idea that nrg files were that much of a pain in the ass to some people. I didnt know because I have Alcohol 12% and its virtual drive reads things that Nreo virtual drive wont. sorry about that, people. I didnt know some people hate nrg that much."
[T],Dark_Swordsman,2007-12-15T16:24Z,"Dudes...if the torrent is stuck, let me know, ..i redid the torrent because my computer was down a while back...i been looking at who is downloading and seeing how far along they are. "
