,Jesuszilla,2008-06-24T23:24Z,"Paul F. had a solid set...bout the only one I thought was garbage was the guy that ranted on about ""So this is the way its gonna be-I didn't sign off on that"" for 5 minutes with no actual joke, I hope that was a joke-like he told the crowd to laugh so I would feel like I had to be there. And as much as I like David Cross he's starting to sound a little bitchy."

You can't expect everyone to have your specific comedic tastes. Stop acting like your opinion is correct and just enjoy the comedy that you enjoy. Perhaps it is your first time interacting with people of differing opinions, though, so I'll give you a break."
,ajpoopieschitz,2008-11-12T05:00Z,"Squeek, they arent saying their opinions are right they are just saying what they like and why they are downloading this wtf is wrong about that? so people arent supposed to communicate unless they have the same opinion? just seed and let the big boys tak ok sweetie?

,ryoran109,2009-08-27T01:58Z,"Personally, my favourite is David Cross, but I also really like Patton Oswalt, Doug Benson, Hard 'n Phirm, Chris Hardwick, Brian Posehn, Mindy Kaling, and Andy Daly, so this CD looks pretty solid. Thanks for the up!"
