,epletull,2007-11-24T00:53Z,"how can the crack only be 240 kb? haven't tried it, but it seems kind of fishy"
,tomaslover,2007-11-24T00:57Z,I've just updated and it works fine ...without crack..
,epletull,2007-11-24T01:00Z,"well, I'll be damned... works like a charm... though I think I will run a complete virusscan right about now, just to be sure"
,zinkywinks,2007-11-24T05:26Z,"i tried that loader, didnt work for me... sigh"
,kroonprins,2007-11-24T12:25Z,"Does not seem to work for me either.
@epletull: how did you make it work?"
,rjh419,2007-11-24T13:28Z,"Try reinstalling the patch update then just copy the crack ( fmloader ) into the installation folder. Now, you should have 2 EXE files in there - click on the FMloader file... MAKE sure you leave the EXE file named ( fm ) in there but do not use it to open the game itself... hope it works !!!"
,o1-slc,2007-11-24T13:46Z,"Thanks Poland1 !!

,kroonprins,2007-11-24T20:22Z,"I have Vista and first I also got the ""can't find cd""-errors. But when i run the fmloader.exe as administrator and set the compatibility mode of fm.exe to XP, these errors disappear for some reason."
,zinkywinks,2007-11-25T00:25Z,hmmm... i was wondering if it was cuz of vista... guess i'll give it another shot
