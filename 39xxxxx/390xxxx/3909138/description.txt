Guided By Voices, September 2nd, 1994 AUD recording by Scott Nuckles / \"Chapter 18\" of DtS.

This may have been Jim Greer\'s debut on bass as evidenced by Pollard\'s quote \"Give it up for our new bass player Jim Greer\"

Lots of classics from the forthcoming, \"Scalping the Guru\" LP / Alien Lanes LP, Bee Thousand, and a few rarities from the EP\'s of the same era.  This is a great setlist.  The vocals are a bit muddy...but no worries as we all know the lyrics anyway  :)

Once again BIG THANKS to Scott Nuckles / \"Chapter 18\" from DtS for taping this and sharing it with us!

Long live GBV!
