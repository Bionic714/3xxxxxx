A documentary movie about what's probably the most violent gang in the world, MS 13.


Join host Lisa Ling in a chilling installment of National Geographic Explorer that travels from Los Angeles to El Salvador to explore the innermost workings of the most feared gang on the planet. A powerful offshoot of the once insignificant Mara Salvatrucha gang, MS-13 has rapidly evolved into a formidable criminal empire. In the 1980s a law was passed that called for non-U.S. citizens to be deported to their country of origin after serving life sentences on stateside shores. As a result of this law, countries such as El Salvador that had never experienced serious gang problems were forced to watch helplessly as those who learned their violent trade in the U.S. returned home to spread their violent agenda. Now, as twenty-year old MS-13 member Jester comes forward to shed illuminating light on a culture shrouded in secrecy, host Ling and her fearless film crew will embark on their most dangerous mission to date. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide
