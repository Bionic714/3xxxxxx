Amiga PD CDs - 17 Bit Collection A&B

This is the first two CDs of the 17-Bit Collection on Amiga formatted CDs, designed to run on an Amiga with an A570 drive or CDTV. 

These two CDs contain a wealth of early Amiga Public Domain greats: Scene Demos, Music, Utilties, and Games.

You can also use the CDs on Windows systems, all the software is in DMS format so could be converted to ADF with DMS2ADF and then run on an emulator if you must. There's no index in Windows though so you'll be flying blind!

I was able to burn these images onto CD using an NEC burner but couldn't read it in Windows using the same drive, but a Lite-On drive would read it... My A500+ with A570 drive can read it though.

If this is popular then I'll post the next 3 CDs in the series which feature increasingly more AGA stuff, so remember to leave comments if you want more :)
