,KlingKlang,2008-02-03T14:37Z,Is it possible to run them on CD32?
,judgecal,2008-02-25T20:59Z,Sorry for the late response. I don't know much about CD32 apart from it was kind of an AGA Amiga console that ran off CDs! You need a floppy drive for these to work though as each disk is stored in DMS format and is unpacked to a floppy disk so that'll run in an Amiga. The individual programmes aren't run directly from the CD itself. Did they bother making floppy drives for CD32??
