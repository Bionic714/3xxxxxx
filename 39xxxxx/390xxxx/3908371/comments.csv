i have 18 people trying to download 3 and the seeds drop off and don't finish.
when i see some seeds i'll come back and seed this one i can't upload everything by myself. with all the hit and runners."
,carolinawolf,2007-11-25T21:07Z,"ALL 4 ARE UP
Hang  on I'm trying to seed all 4 eps so it may be slow going until we get a few seeds up.
no fear i will keep it going.
if you can please jump on and help seed some of the others if you have them.

I have Lonesome Dove The Original in 4 eps. i plan to seed when these are well seeded."

,carolinawolf,2007-11-26T16:02Z,"disregard the link above. i have found numerous new people just now starting to download all the torrents at once. there is not enough bandwidth to seed all the torrents at one time.
i have seeded over 20 gigs because of hit and runs. now these new people are downloading all at one time and downloading 4 gigs and seeding back only a trickle.
after most have finished they just leave with out seeding back.
each time this is done someone has to seed another 4 gigs to fill in what they have stolen.
 i will repost Lonesome Dove after the ""Lonesome Dove the Original"" has 3 seeds.
if you haven't started it please don't it will be reposted at a later time as Lonesome Dove . i will only put up one every three days because of the ones that jump on all at once and then hit and run.
when they are posted you will have three days to get them, after that i will not reseed."
