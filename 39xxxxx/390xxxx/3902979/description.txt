Searching for a way to express the thoughts and emotions of themselves and so many, Endless Array was formed in 2002. The band is made up of three best friends that grew up together having an instinctual and unconscious understanding of each other's creativity, ability, and style...and a vocalist with the experience of life and the desire to bring forth his revelations. This combination of styles, experiences, raw talent, youth, and an unstoppable drive to express their emotions and thoughts in the best way they know how, has resulted in one of the freshest rock bands to emerge in recent years.



Writing and building from the beginning...their hard-hitting, emotionally charged debut album -'Between God and Man'- was born.  Produced and recorded by John Briglevich at Sonica Studios in Atlanta, GA. and mastered by Rodney Mills, the album fully depicts the emotion and energy that the band set out to capture.
