,sweet_hannah888,2007-12-08T20:58Z,it is working or not?
,Notcow,2008-01-11T03:54Z,nope.
,Chaos_rde,2008-01-30T21:25Z,"whoever said this is a Virus, just because it's a fucking older version needs to be shot 9 times in the face, curbstomped, and creamated, then have their ashes pissed on by Ozzy. I downloaded this and it works fine."
,Durik2,2008-03-01T16:17Z,"Before installation of spysweeper itself, file spysweeper 5.5.exe, try to copy file (runtime.exe) into c:\windows ... This runtime.exe is trojan! Tool.Passview.origin.

Be aware!
I'm shure that spysweeper is OK, but he pack the trojan into installer file."
