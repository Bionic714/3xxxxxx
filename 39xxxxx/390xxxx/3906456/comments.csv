,GreenZeal,2008-06-25T00:11Z,This film has been overdubbed and is not the original soundtrack.  I have tried messing around with the subtitles but to no avail.  I suggest if you are not looking for this movie with a commentary you download a different torrent.
,bhobson333,2008-08-14T04:11Z,WTF?  Why is this the best-seeded version of this movie two months after only one comment and it is very negative?
,DogNo7,2008-10-19T06:27Z,"Fnord!

I have just rechecked this file, and the audio is original.  It has been an actively downloaded torrent averaging about 30 seeders and 30 leachers since it was originally seeded.

I viewed the file on my Xbox, and on Windows Media Player.

The audio track you refer to with the comments IS in the file, but most players will automatically pick the first (original) soundtrack rather than the commentary.

This was a rip I did a while ago, using the original divx encoder from divx.com.  As such, it is conforms 100% with the Divx standard, which allows for multiple audio tracks.

So I don't get labeled as a dillweed, I will simply provide the following advice:

If you hear the commentary of the film rather than the original soundtrack, press the AUDIO button on your Divx compliant DVD player, or if viewing on a pc, choose the other audio track using the controls in whatever program you use to watch video.

Most people will just be able to plug it in, double click or whatever, and have everything hunky dory.

Take it easy, and enjoy the film.

,DogNo7,2010-06-10T18:12Z,"To date, this has been my most successful torrent.

Considering the age of the torrent, and it has had consistently > 25 seeders, I think it is fair to say it is a success.

,aardvaarks,2011-08-08T04:30Z,I first tried it with Real Player and it has two old men talking all the way through the movie. Ugh. Then I tried with VLC player and it works fine. Nice download. Thanks.
