Ok, here is Crescendo as I promised. Aside from the bug at installation that causes it to appear in Japanese, however there is a TXT along to help which I also copied and pasted here. No big deal thu, the game is in english and works.

This game appears to be in Japanese when you install it, but once you start it, it's in English. Just choose the topmost choise on the autorun menu to start the installer.
