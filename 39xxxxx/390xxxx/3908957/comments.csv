,Cortax,2008-04-19T15:40Z,Im afraid I cant help you Void_freedom as the problem you mentioned has never occured for me and your the first to mention this since I uploaded this torrent
,RedHeaDude,2008-04-28T01:51Z,"If you don't mind, I'd like a step by step explanation of how to install and play this game. I usually install it successfully but get lost from there. 
I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. "
,RedHeaDude,2008-04-28T02:32Z,Fact is that it never stopped being in Japanese like you said...so I cannot get it to work. Am I supposed to use daemon or what? 
,the_greedy,2008-05-28T15:04Z,Can someone tell me how I install it please or what I need to do.
,john104,2008-07-09T12:56Z,"Download Crescendo_NoDVD.rar from:

[http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php?t=72992]

and copy the extracted file to C:\Program Files\DO\CRESD. Doubble click the the file and patch. Doubble click CRESD.EXE and the game should strart, at least it did for me. I hope this helps.

P.S.: Some text and menue commands will be in Japaness."
,Lovalin,2008-08-10T11:22Z,This is an amazing game. It has an incredible story that is entirely unexpected for an h-game.
,Cortax,2008-08-21T01:42Z,"Of course the game is in Japanese but the text should be in Enlish, I assume that is what you are refering too. As for installing, you must be doing something wrong here....this game shouldnt need a crack."
,Xchaoslord,2008-09-18T08:40Z,"HOLY S#IT! ...it's so beautiful...this game T_T.
After you finish one ending, there will be extras on the main menu. Go to Extras, then Music, then play the ""The Sky of a Sunset"". The piano piece is great. This is the reason why I practice piano in the first place :)! I'll seed this game till I die XD!"
,Takashi-kun,2008-10-12T11:41Z,"yeah like i am currently having the same problem,
both the CD images don`t respond to deamon tools and if a No-CD crack 'is used i also get the GGD error message since it`s japanese i can`t really fix that problem so...does anyone else here knows a system similair to deamon tools?"
,robertoII,2008-10-24T15:50Z,"i'm currently having the same problem (probably) as Takashi-kun. the image won't show on daemon tools.

can you give a step-by-step  explanation to help us with installing this game?

should i use a different software other than daemon tools?"
,robertoII,2008-10-24T15:53Z,"to those who have downloaded and successfully played the game, can you guys tell us how you guys installed the game? please make in clear and specific for us.

much appreciated."

,Cortax,2009-01-18T02:04Z,I wonder what it is that makes this game seeming to work for some but not others. From what I read here I have seen both successful and failure to install/play...and its something I might expect with cracks but I never used any myself so.....just odd.
,pwncakes,2009-02-17T18:49Z,"to those who are getting an error message after installing (and are using Vista) download: http://www.hongfire.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=75664&d=1189160562 (thanks john104) unzip the file, right click the exe and select run as administrator, then select patch, it'll say it cant find the file and if you want to search for it, browse for wherever you installed the game, select the exe file CRESD, it should then patch the file (if not select the patch button again"
[T],Hgames,2009-03-08T14:22Z,@ kingHearts I have all of those except transfer student. http://thepiratebay.org/user/Hgames
,bobon21,2009-04-25T13:21Z,"hey i got the US release of this game. no japanese text there at all. its available here in tpb but it's in cd (2 in fact), not dvd. problem is, no crack seems to work for it. anyone have an idea how to make the crack work? it's annoying to keep loading the disc image everytime i want to play."
,Dymoon,2011-01-27T10:01Z,"it's odd how i made it to work, i practically copied everything from the cd in the computer and installed from the copy and it worked but when i installed from the image it didn`t start. hope this helps."
,dbellringer,2012-03-18T19:32Z,"Game works great
1 thing, is there a way to play it fullscreen on windows 7. Whenever I do it just does a small window in the middle with a black border covering most of the screen"
