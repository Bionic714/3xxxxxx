This one is slow as hell... Just telling ppl like it is.. Is telling the truth ""bitching""?  ...better to wait 1 week or something and then dl it instead of getting stuck all the time...   that was my point of the msg..  

+450 leechers and only 1 complete source...

Hehe... I rather buy it from this side in such case: http://www.discshop.se/shop/ds_produkt.php?lang=&id=45310〈=se&subsite=movies&&ref=

It costs about 10-11Euros there ;)

Cheers!"

,jokily,2007-12-02T11:13Z,B-movie er ikke værd at bruge tid på at hente ned. den slutter midt i handlingen så de kan lave en 2er... buuuh bad movie 
,traxen,2007-12-03T02:10Z,"Ja du Jokily... Om man är så dum att man inte fattar att filmen var i två delar så förstår jag att du inte kunde hänga med i den här filmens handling.

Well then Jokily... if you are so dumb that you didnt get that the movie was two parts, then I understand that you couldn't follow the story."
