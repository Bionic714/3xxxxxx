,Thisiscjfool,2007-11-25T18:03Z,"Does this have swedish subtitles? And a better question, is the quality good? What is the A/V 1-10?"
,Thisiscjfool,2007-11-25T20:10Z,"A-10 V-8. There was a watermark near the middle of the screen, and the overall visual quality wasn't near dvd at all. Also, it went into black and white a few times during the film. Watchable though. The audio was perfect, and if you don't mind swedish subtitles that aren't on a track, so you can't take them off, then I suggest watching this."
