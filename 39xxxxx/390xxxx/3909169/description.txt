The Dark Years refers to a difficult period for the UFC where they were almost shut down.  A Congressional posse, led by Senator John Glenn, was hot on their ass.  The UFC was hit hard ? they instituted rule changes, and they stopped selling Tapes of the shows.  Nevertheless, they refused to completely give in to the pressure - and continued with seven Televised Pay-per-View events:  

     UFC 23,   UFC 24,  UFC 25,  UFC 26,  UFC 27,  UFC 28,  and UFC 29, 

During that time of turmoil, the events were seen live on pay per view, but they have never been released on home video or DVD in any form,  Hence the name ? The Dark Years.
