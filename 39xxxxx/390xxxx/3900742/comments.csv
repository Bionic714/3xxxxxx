,supermaroc85,2007-11-22T21:42Z,Hi can somebody tell me what r5 and r1 is??what does it means?im not that good in this yet:)
,Oblivion_4,2007-11-22T21:52Z,Good movie! Thx for the upload moviebobo
,vtroll,2007-11-22T23:15Z,"supermaroc85

From wikipedia: 

R5 refers to a specific format of DVD released in the Former-Soviet Union, which is in DVD Region 5.

In an effort to compete with movie piracy, the movie industry chose to create a new format for DVD releases that could be produced more quickly and less expensively than traditional DVD releases. R5 releases differ from normal releases in that they are usually a direct Telecine transfer of the film without any of the image processing common on DVD releases, and without any special features. This allows the film to be released for sale at the same time that DVD Screeners are released. Since DVD Screeners are the chief source of high-quality pre-DVD release pirated movies, this allows the movie studios to beat the pirates to market. Bootlegged copies of these releases are often distributed on the Internet via torrent sites.

R1 is Region 1 = Bermuda, Canada, the Cayman Islands, United States and U.S. territories

Now with that out of the way, I'd like to say that the amount moronic comments on this torrent over the past 3 years is insane. I think my favorite one is the guy who screamed this was a fake because it was posted 2 weeks before the street release date without even bothering to download it. Manufacturers start shipping DVD's to retailers 1 month ahead of schedule.

Anyway, excellent comedy. Great quality torrent."
