,kjellboy,2008-02-05T03:04Z,"This may be a dumb question. But do i need Action Replay to DS? Or is this a software that installs Action Replay on NDS? 
Sorry for the dumb question. But great upload =)"
,demon15050,2008-02-24T20:11Z,"THANK YOU!! 
I LOST MY CD!
its somewhere under my bed... lol
and kjellboy
you need a usb for action replay.."
,xSilverDragonx,2008-07-02T21:08Z,"Heh, you're welcome. ^^ Yeah, actually I just came back to this page because I've now lost mine, and am I ever glad I uploaded it. And Kjell, you need the actual Action Replay itself and the Mini-USB cord to use this utility; there's no way to just install it on the DS. "
,xSilverDragonx,2008-07-02T21:08Z,Also I now remember my old username. o.o;
