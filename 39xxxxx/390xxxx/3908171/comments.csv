first to get a full copy,of ep 3 hit and ran.  http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3908048/Return_to_Lonesome_Dove_EP.3
i have ep. 1 and 2 to seed also."
,skamfer,2007-11-25T10:24Z,"Thanks for this one. There are many who hasen't understood about filesharing e.g. minimium ratio is 1:1.
do you also have the first part of Lonesome Dove?
I will start dl later tonight and be sure i will seed when finished"
,carolinawolf,2007-11-25T11:00Z,"yes i have all the parts, as soon as i  get people to stick around to help seed i will post the parts 1 and 2 also."
,skamfer,2007-11-25T15:57Z,"Thank you for that. I see there are ""several"" with 100% but they are not seeding too much (2 - 5 kbps). As it is now it will take me about 24 - 36 hours to get 100%. Will seed to atleast 1:1,5.
What i meant about rest of the serie is if you have the first part of Lonesome Dove or is it only ""Return to Lonesome Dove""? I thought there maybe was a part called Lonesome Dove?
Again Thanks alot."
,carolinawolf,2007-11-25T17:02Z,yes there is a lonesome dove. but that's another story. { i have them}It's on two DVD-Rs the way this is going with people dropping off and or seeding so slow.don't think I want to get stuck trying to up two DVDs. it comes in 6 or more parts.
,carolinawolf,2007-11-25T17:10Z,wait i have found it in 4 parts {Lonesome Dove}  {not bit torrent} i may give it a go after these are up a day or two.
,carolinawolf,2007-11-25T18:55Z,Will post Lonesome Dove The Original.  in 4 parts if i ever get these up and seeded.
,carolinawolf,2007-11-25T21:07Z,"ALL 4 ARE UP
Hang  on I'm trying to seed all 4 eps so it may be slow going until we get a few seeds up.
no fear i will keep it going.
if you can please jump on and help seed some of the others if you have them.

I have Lonesome Dove The Original in 4 eps. i plan to seed when these are well seeded."

,carolinawolf,2007-11-26T16:04Z,"disregard the link above. i have found numerous new people just now starting to download all the torrents at once. there is not enough bandwidth to seed all the torrents at one time.
i have seeded over 20 gigs because of hit and runs. now these new people are downloading all at one time and downloading 4 gigs and seeding back only a trickle.
after most have finished they just leave with out seeding back.
each time this is done someone has to seed another 4 gigs to fill in what they have stolen.
i will repost Lonesome Dove after the ""Lonesome Dove the Original"" has 3 seeds.
if you haven't started it please don't it will be reposted at a later time as Lonesome Dove . i will only put up one every three days because of the ones that jump on all at once and then hit and run.
when they are posted you will have three days to get them, after that i will not reseed."
