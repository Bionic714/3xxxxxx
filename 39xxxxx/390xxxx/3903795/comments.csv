,bachrocks,2008-05-25T13:12Z,"""only old cr_p till impressionism."" 
I hate that word, ""cr_p"" and I am one American who loves abstract expressionism as well as dark age greek pottery.
""Americans are to dumb to understand Europian modern art.""
Well, at least one of us can spell. It's EUROPEAN!!!"

"" ...thats all the teaching company videos.  theyre suppose to give you the ""lecture room feel"" so you feel like youre in a classroom learning from a teacher.  I kinda like it because i'm use to learning things this way.

If one feels like "" Europian "" art is too lofty an art form and another fellow "" kinda ain' liking a dumbass "" it is perfectly fine  .... after thanking dohduhdah for his generosity in time and resources.

My humble opinion of modern paintings: 
The result of poor vision, schizophrenia or lack of skills. The talent lies in the ability of explaining such a work that could be copied in 10 minutes by a child. PR by clever investors help the propagation of this art form often after the death of the poor wretch.
Thank you dohduhdah
