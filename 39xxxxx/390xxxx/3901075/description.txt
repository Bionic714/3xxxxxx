           Counter Strike Source: Private Mod v1.0 

_____________________________________________________________

This is a small mod for your favourite cheating-game ever. It
was made for purposes of learning how to make a CSS mod, in
other words, for the purposes of education ONLY!

IMPORTANT: This is NOT an official mod. There's no official
webpage where you could download it, no STEAM support, no
modding team behind the project and it definitely won't be
updated. Everything is provided "as is", use it on your own
risk.

MORE IMPORTANT: You're not allowed to use this mode in public
nor to promote it nor to change or update any of its parts.
The mod consists mostly of the new skins, models and animati-
ons downloaded from http://www.counter-strike-dl.com/ and it
represents a COMPILATON of the best materials which can be
found there. Of course, some additions were made by myself,
like the scripts, and the updated "cstrike_english.txt" and
"csd.ttf" files.
