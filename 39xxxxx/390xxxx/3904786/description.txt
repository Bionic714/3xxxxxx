Goldfrapp has announced that its next album, \\\"Seventh Tree,\\\" will come out on Feb. 26 via Mute, but warns that it may surprise fans of the group\\\'s previous studio set.

\\\"It\\\'s very different to [2005\\\'s] \\\'Supernature,\\\' so it might come as a bit of a shock to some of you,\\\" said Goldfrapp\\\'s Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory on the band\\\'s MySpace page. \\\"We had fun making it and loved doing something that is in complete contrast to the last album, even though sometimes it took a bit of courage to steer as far away as we did on some of the tunes.\\\"
