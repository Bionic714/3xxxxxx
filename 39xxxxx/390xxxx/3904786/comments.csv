,Burger666,2008-02-07T04:05Z,"This is an incredibly gorgeous album, more similar to Felt Mountain than the two in between but perhaps not as dark. 

Thanks seventhtree for the preview. I will be spending my hard-earned on this for sure."
,twojawas,2008-02-17T12:05Z,Very poor quality. Lots of popping and cracking in each file.
,mikecrash,2008-02-19T19:33Z,"I just listened to this, no poor quality effects, in fact, Awesome audio! 

Def one of the best albums I have EVER heard. In the top 5, for sure. Get it!!!!! "
