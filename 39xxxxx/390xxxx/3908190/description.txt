Silat: Martial Art of Malaysia
airdate: 11-23-2007

Few martial arts match the exoticism of their country like Silat.
Beautiful, yet deadly, Silat was born in the jungles of Southeast Asia.
Practiced in secrecy for centuries, and with its strong ties to Islam, 
Silat is one of the most intriguing and least understood fighting systems
on the planet. Now our hosts Jason Chambers and Bill Duff are going to 
face the world of Silat--and their fears--head on. They'll train in 
weltering outdoor training compounds...in the shadow of the world's tallest
twin towers...and jump through rings of fire in preparation for the ultimate
test--a pitched battle against six Silat masters.
