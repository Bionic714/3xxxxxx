A psychiatric patient is released and goes on a killing spree in this early 1980s slasher with Freudian themes. Banned in the UK for more than ten years
The first scene of Nightmares In A Damaged Brain sets the tone for the rest of the film. A man wakes from a confused nightmare to find himself in a bed full of blood and gore, on the end of which there lies a severed head that suddenly opens its eyes.
