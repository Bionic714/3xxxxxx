sorry, but I don't have that yet...When that episode will be playing on the NGC, I'll record it for sure..no problem...Because the show is not playing everyday, I think only twice a week (tuesday and wednesday). I have to check the EPG (TV guide) for the actual airing

can you please add the ""Gare de Lyon train accident"". I've be looking for that for a long time. And also would be great to have the ""Eschede train disaster"".
Thank you,

Costin"

i dont have those 2 yet, when they will be playing, ill record it...as i said before, the show is only in the air 2x a week (or 2x a month) at NGC...tuesday, i recorded the london subway inferno, and wednesday, this one...the rest that played this week, I/you already have it (wich is the tunnel inferno at france/italy, the skywalk collapse and the mexican disaster/explosion with the gas in the sewer.

You can check the official website of NGC for the schedules of this show.

,Dani25,2007-12-01T05:50Z,"The next episode I am gonna record and upload here is the ""American Embassy Bombing"" one. It's a new episode, I never saw it. It's gonna be aired on Tuesday, December 18th from 12PM to 1PM, so be patient...As you can see, the show is only aired twice/month (tuesday and wednesday) and most episodes that are playing now, you have them already, they are not new.
But ill get most of the new ones, for sure"

Good news for you, the ""The Super Outbreak"" (Tornado Outbreak) episode will be on air at February 19th 2008 at 4PM, along with another new episode at 12PM, so I will record it for sure, no problem :)"
