,FlightSimerr,2007-11-25T06:32Z,I don't understand why people request things? when they don't even upload anything? i've never requested anything...
,globalair01,2007-11-26T20:00Z,"I believe it's due to the fact they're n00bs ;-)

Thanks for the upload :-D"
,yo7,2007-11-26T20:53Z,please request: DREAMTEAM LSZH Zurich for fs2004 and fsx
,gaffe75,2007-11-27T02:31Z,is it easy to install ?
,FlightSimerr,2007-11-27T19:59Z,"Yes it's easy to install. Just double click on the .exe and insert the serial number and it's all set. 

Good Luck. This version has a far better MCDU (fmc) than v1. "
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-01T07:31Z,"Just so you know someone uploaded the v2b of this package. So after you download and install this v2a  continue on with 2b and use the same key. Good Luck!! and thanks to whoever uploaded 2b. pretty awesome group of flight simer's here on TPB, lets all put in effort to keep it up.

There's the link to 2b. 


I will never fill a request unless it is to get in a pillow fight with highschool chicks in there underwear while flying through St. Marteen on fsx.  that is certainly a request i could fullfill.

But a Harrier?? is that all you can come up with? atlease request a F35 JSF.. I'd love to see one of those for FSX. 

Also i get my portable drive back in a week, i let a budd barrow it. I have about 200gb of fs2004 payware on it. So keep in touch.
