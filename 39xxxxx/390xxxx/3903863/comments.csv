,blue_sportz,2007-11-23T04:31Z,"First of All I want to say Excellent Job!

I also want to say you have to correct your NDS Releases Number...
Below are the one that is not a release number
463 - Max media Luncher 
799 - NinjaPass X9TF
1386 - Bionicle Heroes
So your numbers are off by two ...
For Correct Release list of number you can easily check at http://sccheats.co.uk/index.html

Keep up the good work!"
[T],magumagu,2007-11-23T06:28Z,"@blue_sportz:
First of all, thanks, but:
I know that my releases are off by two numbers compared to a few other lists, but as I've always stated, and as mentioned in the info-file, do I use Pocket Heaven's release list. Always have been, and if they don't disappear in a puff of pink smoke, always will.

Pocket Heaven's list contain the mentioned ""not a release number""-roms, and as long as they're still there, I'll keep them in my packs.

With regards to the sccheats-list, I don't see any info on the roms: checksum, releasegroup, comments, release-nfos etc. From their page:

""SCcheats is a supercard cheat database were me (jmr) & meangreenie from scdev have converted all the english cheats from  codejunkies.""

It's not easy making proper packs free from nukes by just picking a rom that seems right and renaming it by hand. You need a proper release list. Pocket Heaven's is one, and a reliable one as well; it has been around since the old days when Game Boy Color was king.

Thing is if I was to actually switch list and redo the roms, I would have to unpack + rename about 1200 roms and repack said roms with 7-zip with the new naming. Since these archives would be different from the old ones, with new checksums and whatnot, would this move render them incompatible with my old torrents, thus making future seeding of those impossible. I do not think that would make anyone happy.

Even worse, if I was to keep on to Pocket Heaven's list but alter the numbering by hand would that double the time which I already do not have for fixing these packs.

Ergo, no, I won't rename and ""fix"" old roms ...

Cheers

I use the command line 7-zip with parameters
7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on -bd "".7z"" "".nds""

Which i assume means ... (Checking the man-pages to remember) ...
7-Zip archive
LZMA algorithm
Ultra compression
64 Fast Bytes
32M dictionary size

If your games don't work, use that:

That worked for me!!!!!!"
,Itsara,2007-12-20T00:16Z,"THE ARM7-FIX

What?
A few dumped roms today comes with a new kind of protection, commonly referred to as the ""arm7-protection"". If you try to load a protected rom on some flash carts (R4, DS-X, G6 etc.), you will receive an error that tells you that something went wrong with your save file (or equivalent) and you will not be able to play the dumped rom. In this thread, you'll learn how to crack these roms by yourself, bypassing this protection.

If your game won't start and gives you an error message about saving data, you most likely need the arm7-fix.
A hacked arm7.bin file can be downloaded http://ds.loathsome.us/files/arm7.bin, and will do the trick for every game (per today) that requires this fix.

Brief tutorial on how to replace the arm7.bin-file:

1. Open up the rom with http://ds.loathsome.us/files/dslazy.zip and click «nds unpack»
2. A new window will now open, do not close this.
3. Copy the hacked arm7.bin-file (link earlier in this post) inside the newly opened directory (NDS_UNPACK), and replace the existing arm7.bin-file
4. Click «nds packer», select where to save the modified file and load the rom up on your flash cart.
5. Happy gaming!
