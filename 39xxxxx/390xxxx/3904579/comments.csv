,IttoDaigoro,2007-11-23T02:21Z,Is there a lot of Russian dialogue in the film?
,stop.leilei,2007-11-23T02:47Z,"You can watch it without the subs, you won?t lose anything important (you will miss a questioning near the end that might give background info, but nothing important to the storyline). Most of the russian you can kinda guess from the context.
