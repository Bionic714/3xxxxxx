This is a documentary, NOT a concert video. Although kkab, who is to be thanked and commended for this upload, has made that clear,  I just thought it ought to be made even more clear."

They get a lot of facts just plain wrong, based on several other sources. All the video clips have copyright notices, implying they are ripping other people off and hoping not to get sued.

Kudos to kkab for uploading.  Boo to the producers of this rot."
