I wouldn't download it if I were you."
,gamepsyched,2008-02-03T05:13Z,"DONT CHANGE YOUR SID!!!!!

The windows blinds is ok but DO NOT change your sid it messes up your files and he can access your computer.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS YOU WILL LOSE EVERYTHING. THERE ARE OTHER WINDOWS BLINDS ON THIS SITE GO THERE!"
,hammergunner,2008-02-16T12:05Z,"OK lets get to cracking this

just set the sig6.bin file to READ ONLY

you can use the sid changer on some systems and still keep all your info and data

BUT I SAY SO NOT CHANGE YOUR SID
THIS MAY MESS WITH CORE SYSTEM FILES"

The application is fine but do not run the crack/keygen.

It is infected with a trojan, had to reset my computer but then my pc wouldn't load up unless i ran it in safe mode, got rid of the trojan now and pc back to normal.

,oblivoratodan,2008-05-17T20:30Z,"jake you silly boy no theres not your fucked!

,frequent980,2008-06-08T06:35Z,"Wow, sure are a lot of shit talkers here hiding behind a computer (the difference between PB and Demonoid). I hope you nerds don't run your mouths off in public like this or you'll piss off the wrong person where your computer can't protect you.  If you don't want your computer fucked up then buy the software. "
,DarthAndroid,2008-06-15T17:49Z,"QuikJake: If you know your old SID, then simply change your SID back to what it was using the ""newsid"" program found on the sysinternals section of microsoft's website (google search ""newsid sysinternals""). If you don't know what your old SID is and you have at least XP pro, (home and MCE are no good), then right click on the my documents folder -> properties -> security -> advanced permissions to view all users with access, and there'll be a SID (where the SID has no username to display) and that should be your old SID"
,Sipkecool,2008-07-03T12:41Z,thanks for seeding. great tool.
,Sipkecool,2008-07-03T13:17Z,don't use that crack if you have the same sid you can share documents. he get your documents of you. sorry for my bad english

,erichere,2009-02-10T07:15Z,"All of u stop talking shit cos nt bein funny but this dude has put his time and effort in puttin it on here so stop being ungratefull!!!!!!
peace !"
,supanut,2010-06-16T11:52Z,"If you're scared, try it on VMware. Disable shared folders for safety of your host system. If it works in VMware, it should work in the real system.
I do this for all programs, including Windows Powershell."
,supanut2000,2010-07-18T15:51Z,"Hi, me again;but with new username.
I agree with all of you;I believe this fuckin't dude don't know anything about computer, but if you still want to try, do it in VMware, and have shared folders disabled! Atleast if your vm were fucked up, just right-click and choose delete from disk and push yes in the confirmation, then create a new vm. If it works, then great, but still don't turn on shared folders! Put any files you want to put in your guest on to a floppy or CD!"
,jpatt1306,2010-10-28T08:21Z,"I am an idiot for not investigating more before downloading this. I had gotten used to quality torrents on Pirate Bay and got lax in my investigation and screening before installing. I had software on my computer than can never be replaced and pictures of family members, some that have died, that are all gone. My back up was on a separate partition and I have always been safe with having that. HOWEVER, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT SOME SADISTIC PIECE OF GARBAGE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO PUT SOMETHING ON HERE THAT WOULD LITERALLY DESTROY PEOPLES COMPUTERS, AND MEMORIES IN MY CASE. THIS TORRENT NOT ONLY WIPED ME OUT BUT DESTROYED MY DRIVE COMPLETELY AND IT'S TAKEN ME 4 DAYS TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND STRUGGLE TO REPLACE WHAT I CAN. LEARN FROM ME, AND APPARENTLY A FEW OTHERS, THAT NOT EVERYONE ON THE BAY HAS A SOUL INSIDE AND THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT DESTROYING YOUR PROPERTY AND MEMORIES. MY GUESS IS SOME PUNK KID THOUGHT HE WAS A HACKER AFTER WATCHING THE DAMN MOVIE TOO MANY TIMES BY HIMSELF, AND AFTER SWILLING MOUNTAIN DEWS TILL 3AM ONE NIGHT HAD THE BRIGHT IDEA TO PUT THIS ON PIRATE BAY. WELL, MY COMPUTER IS FIXED NOW AND I'LL GET OVER IT BUT THIS QUEER WILL STILL BE THE SAME LITTLE FAGOT HE WAS WHEN HE PUT THIS UP. THANKS FOR LETTING ME VENT AND PLEASE BE ADVISED
****THIS WILL WIPE YOUR COMPUTER OUT COMPLETELY DESPITE WHAT KIND OF ANTI-VIRUS YOU HAVE SO AVOID IT PLEASE*** "
,supanut2000,2010-11-26T13:23Z,"That's too sad.
If you've read my advice, this won't happen.
Always try Window Blinds cracks in VMware Workstation/XP Mode/Virtualbox.
Also why don't you burn those photoes/programs on to a DVD?"
,supanut2000,2010-11-26T13:31Z,"Also install good avs like mse/avg/avast/avira/forefront/bitdefender/etc.
Also when trying out on a virtual machine, disable all intigration features like shared folders. This will make sure that your host documents/programs/photos/vids/movies/songs/contacts/settings are safe from nasty threats like this one."
,PaulNeaves,2011-06-22T08:22Z,ALWAYS DISCONNECT YOUR BACKUP HARD DISK AND STORE IT AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER! OTHER WISE ITS NOT REALLY A BACKUP AT ALL!!
