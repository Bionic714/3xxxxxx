This is the Mac OS X version of the Rosetta Stone software. It doesn't include any languages. This is hard as hell to find, so I'm uploading to make everyone's life a little bit easier. 

To be honest, I'm still downloading the DVD, so I don't even know that it works yet. However, it's a native universal version, unlike the 2.x series which only run through Classic (and therefore won't even work on Leopard). It does start up and check for updates, but if you give it enough time (a few minutes) it will time out and allow you to add languages. I was unable to add a CD mounted from a .iso either loaded through the built-in Mac mounter or via Toast. If anyone knows what to do in order to fix this, I'm all ears.
