,Netzach,2007-11-24T03:45Z,"If there if any way to get this working I'm happy. Right now I can't afford it, but I've bought software in my past I already had cracked because it's really good and I want to support the developers.

,timdorr,2007-11-24T07:11Z,"Yeah, I'm having no luck with this. Anyone else got any better news?"
,Selman2003,2007-11-24T12:16Z,"Thanx, timdorr, vermy much appreciated. But this is only for Rs's brandnew series 3 language files, no use for version 2 files. Version 3 files need to be activated by internet (only the first 2 sublessons are free)

,west1,2007-11-24T13:41Z,Version 2.0.7 of the app works fine under Leopard. The V2 language packs don't work with V3 though.
,timdorr,2007-11-24T22:36Z,"Well, I guess this is kind of useless then. Would it be possible to block it via Little Snitch? What about those that want to use it on computers without internet access?"
,hockpooh,2007-11-24T23:55Z,"On a lot of apps that phone home all you have to do is disconnect the internet, install, go to the application's prefs and uncheck ""check for updates"", then plug your internet back in.
You should add a language by downloading it, then add it with the internet off, just to make sure."
,4j1t,2007-11-25T14:58Z,just use little snitch and it will tell you and stop apps from communicating and does anyone have language packs for this 
,phatgenius,2007-11-26T23:30Z,Any more luck on this at all?  Language files? Any update would be great.
,cykauchuujin,2007-11-28T15:35Z,"is there a working version of 2 anywhere? i have no problem opening this one, but it doesn't seem to support the main language i want (danish).  also, it asks for the cd rom to add a language, anyone know where to get these?

I want to learn Japanese and I am wondering if this file is worth downloading? 

I'm on a PowerBook G4, and everything everyone has been saying doesn't make sense to me. 

I am new to apples and I would have no problem  figuring something out like this on a PC, I just don't understand how I am going to get this program to work. If anyone can help me, I would really appreciate it. 

You can email me at joujoudoll@yahoo.com

,elcrunkeristo,2008-01-20T19:07Z,"Could registration control be as simple as replacing/modifying the activation.xml file in the /Contents/Resources/support/config/ directory of the application package? I'm guessing it's not that simple, but just a thought. I'm not seeing the comment now, but I got an activation code from either this thread or another TPB thread that worked, but of course then requires the call-and-response code. Anyone have an idea of how to generate one, or hack this in general?"

,mankydp,2008-02-03T03:22Z,"got it to work and bypass the activation.  I am not sure if it will work beyond 30 days though... I have not run it this long.  I went to the library/app support/rst v3/.  I moved to the desktop the Bin folder, flexnet etc. folder and the two *.dylib files.  I then start it up and it pops up with an error screen and bypasses the activation.  I think this is because the activation.xml file had two installed languages at the time.  I am not sure if this can be edited to get rid of the error screen.  Tell me if I am on the right track.  Also, has anyone found a full version 3 all language dvd?  The 2007 version does not look right."

,tylerdm,2008-02-12T23:35Z,"I moved the Activation.xml from the library to my desktop, and without the file, the program ignores the activation screen. I don't know if that means it still won't require it though."

1) Open THIS file. Install.
2) Install language packs.
3) Turn on your Internet to let it update to 3.2.11. DO NOT CLOSE RS EVEN IF THE UPDATE BAR DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MOVING. It will take about an hour, so go read a book or something.
4) RS will reset itself. Quit once it turns back on.
5) Apply the crack that ohsilv3r provided.
6) TURN OFF YOUR INTERNET. If you have Wireless, just turn off your Airport.
7) It will ask you to do phone activation. Use the Activation key/numbers provided in the crack.
8) Enjoy!"

Here's where I'm at now:

I uninstalled everything (dragged the app to trash and deleted everything from Library->App Support->RS3 folder) but after trying to re-install from scratch I am getting stuck at installing the the update. It's downloading ok, I just an error after clicking update saying ""An error occurred preventing the installation from completing."" 

As a result, I can't install my language pack either (get the 9114 error). I have a feeling something isn't being deleted that should be.

Also, I notice that after installing the RS3 app it does not go into my apps folder, it is placed under my Mac hard drive; there with Library, System, Applications, etc. 

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. I've googled the hell out of this and now turn to you in the forums. Please help. "
