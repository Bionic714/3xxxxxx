The Spider-Man PC game for 2001. A great, kickass game.


To use the game:




Open Spider-Man.mdf in UltraISO.


Mount it to a virtual drive (Assuming you set the UltraISO drive emulator).


Run Autorun.exe or Setup.exe and you can do the rest on your own.


Once done, unzip SPIDER-MAN.NOCD.ZIP, then launch SetupReg.exe, then drag and drop SpideyPC.exe and navigate to where you installed Spider-Man, and replace the SpideyPC.exe with the modified once, and launch the game from there.
