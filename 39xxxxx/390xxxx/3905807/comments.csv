Enjoy!

I am happy to share all my collection with you!

I very much appreciate all the efforts that you are deploying to keep the Fu alive by seeding these torrents, whenever possible and with the means that you have at your disposal, and I sincerely thank you all.

Together, let's keep the Fu alive, REGARDLESS OF THE CARYING BOAT!

If you happen to be an active seeder, please drop your hotmail email address so that other Fu Members could contact you for a possible reseed."

I'd really appreciate a reseed of this film as the first part kicked ass and I already have the third part but not this one. I'm downloading most of your movies and I'll definitely seed them as long as there are downloaders out there with the only problem being my unstable connection, since I'm using someone else's connection from a student dormitory.

It somewhat grieves me to make an account for a request, but I also want to let you know I'm doing my part in keeping the Fu alive on the net. I'm also aware of your restrictions, but I'm keeping my hopes up.

Thanks. Let's continue kicking ass."
