,Fallout_Slaughter,2007-11-20T17:43Z,"OOps, sorry! I was so sad about what happened to demonoid that I switched words! I mean Daemon Tools!"
,Fireice_,2007-11-21T12:43Z,"Now, since you put the torrent here, how about actually SEEDING it?"
,Fallout_Slaughter,2007-11-22T21:58Z,"Don't worry, seeding's underway right now. Enjoy the game!"
,Dagge86,2007-12-01T21:09Z,"the multiplayer part does not work for me, any suggetions what might be the problem?"
,Fallout_Slaughter,2007-12-03T21:33Z,"Dagge, are you trying to conect to Earthnet? Maybe it's down.

I've already played it with Hamachi and it works, by the way."
,reverend_njord,2007-12-03T22:45Z,"If you've got a multiprocessor system or a dual/quad core processor, the game will be pretty much unplayable. To fix this, make sure it only runs on one core by using the processes tab of the task manager. (CTRL+ALT+DEL)"

,Cgoff87,2010-03-13T07:29Z,"I take that back... I wrote about the wrong torrent lol. The one I meant was Total Annihilation, Also a great game!"
,skylar15,2011-04-16T19:11Z,There is no seeders D:
,Fallout_Slaughter,2011-10-10T21:26Z,"After changing computers and being internet-less, I now find myself with a Earth 2150 itch to scratch (didn't manage to play the whole game). I remember almost nothing about it, so its going to be like I'm playing a new game, whee!

So I'm now downloading my own torrent, and hoping someone seeds it too, oh the irony.

For those that wished for more seeders, the reason I didn't seed more is that I lost internet acess some time. I'm going to download all the Earth 2150 games, put them together and put a new complete Earth 2150 collection, now with MOAR seeding.

Also, for people that like games like this: If you like this game, please swing by the ex-Pumpkin-2/NEWST/Project Warzone/Whatever they're calling themselves this week's site and download Warzone 2100, as its a game in the similar style of this one. I wish Earth 2150 went open-source too, it has been ten years and I'm sure someone would do something awesome to it."
,galantjunior,2012-04-18T11:55Z,this torrent is dead. I can't download it... someone seed please
