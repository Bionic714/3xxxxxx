I have no idea which episode it is - i've downloaded it from some other site (the tracker listed however is tpb but the search here did not return any results) and thought it's so good that i should make it my first ever torrent.

I don't care where it came from - it doesn't seem to be a tv rip.

The quality's crystal but the window is small, probably 640x480.

I will seed it but no hard feelings if it will be slow, i have a sucky russian isp.

if you don't like the description or anything else - gfys.

the [GFYS] thing is just a joke
