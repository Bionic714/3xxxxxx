,RockyMista,2007-11-26T20:38Z,"I agree, if someone scanned and uploaded the gameguide, it would be totally awesome!"
,Vinnsent,2007-11-27T14:58Z,Thanks a lot!
,themurloc,2007-12-16T20:41Z,stupid question: What do you open torrents with?
,NezzoX,2008-01-08T14:39Z,"Well themurloc, if you are from sweden there are a guide at http://support.nezzox.se"
,VEpP,2008-02-27T00:23Z,"themurloc,

i use the original bittorrent client, which can be found at bittorrents website. 
but many others like to use the uTorrent client, which is basically a rip off of the bitTorrent client. I believe Azeurus is pretty good too. all can be googled."
,solidsnake2085,2008-03-22T07:39Z,why would you need a gameguide? You can figure things out on your own? Or atleast go to gamefaqs.com? Also thanks for this great upload!

,iketheclerk,2008-09-15T11:08Z,Sweet! 
,overclucker,2008-11-03T05:43Z,"i wouldn't recommend bitlord, or any other app that forces avertizing on its users, from wikipedia:
Criticisms
BitLord is based on the source code of version 0.56 of the BitComet core (current stable release is 1.1). Because of this, certain bugs that have been resolved in later versions of BitComet are still prevalent in BitLord. The only major changes are advertisements placed on the BitLord interface, and that BitComet's list of BitTorrent sites is replaced with a search box that leads to affiliates of BitLord. BitLord is also being criticized for what some conceive as ""selfish behavior"" and is blocked by some BitTorrent Trackers."
,majca,2008-11-06T12:42Z,"I'm partial to halite personally.  I'm new to the torrent thing and I don't really know what I'm doing, and Halite doesn't clutter my view with stuff I don't understand.  I'll probably upgrade to uTorrent when I'm more knowledgeable."
,c0nair13,2008-11-21T18:05Z,hell yea thx im mainly dl just for m4 part 2 though thats an awesome song
,Lochcelious,2009-01-07T06:45Z,"I prefer Opera 9.6. Not only a kick ass and smart web browser, but the ability to download torrents directly? Ftw."

,max2562,2009-10-17T00:46Z,"WTF is with this game? LOL it's awesome! I totally love it but why didn't I hear much about it before I decided to just try it out? Did they not market this game very much or what? Makes me wonder if I'm missing other great games like this.
Thanks for the upload!! Not many of us that consider ourselves to be part of this community can contribute a great upload like this. So I'm glad you did =)"
,aurora7207,2009-11-21T10:46Z,"I love this game! Thanks for the upload, I didnt think I would find it :)

For anyone who hasn't played it yet, it's not one of those games everyone likes, but, when you do, you ~REALLY~ do."
,coolix,2009-12-10T08:48Z,"@max2562
It's a pretty popular game. I hear about most games from Gametrailers.
And thanks Gunwave, only took 5min to download"
,Furko99,2009-12-26T17:11Z,Fuckin love this game can't wait for ME2 
,m0t0ko,2010-02-09T09:53Z,"@max2562, the reason you may have not heard of it is because Bioware was independent before EA got it's grubby hands on it. Bioware is based in Edmonton, & I'm a proud Edmontonian, I cried a little when the Volcano Fortress took my lovely Bioware....."
,Ringx55,2010-02-17T00:54Z,Fantastic soundtrack to the a fantastic game. The story is much better than ME2 imo
,toenail88,2010-04-13T00:27Z,"I missed out on ME1 as well

I heard all the buzz about ME2 and grabbed it

I have played it through 4 times and want to enter into my computer screen.

The most extraordinary game i have ever ever played

and the music is stunning, I am a Jack Wall and Sam Hulick fan now for sure....

Has anyone read ""Ringworld"" by Larry Niven?

I'm sure the ME series creator has read Larry Niven books.

Thanks all "
