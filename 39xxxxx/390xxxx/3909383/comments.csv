,splatterhead,2007-12-09T06:58Z,No Problem.  Funny story...  I bought the original vinyl for this when it came out and my copy had no insert.  I carried around those 2 albums for 15 years not knowing who some of the artists were.  I was about to rip the vinyl when I discovered the CDs with the 5 bonus songs.
,TheBizCo,2008-04-24T11:30Z,Thanx a lot! Lots of great songs and I found some new bands I want to hear more from. Love italian HC - No mai!
