,Kowalski1977,2007-11-26T13:09Z,"Is it possible for a blacksite area 51 rip, the original download is over 10gb that's a bit over the top for a mediocre game which ppl still want to have a look at, you would be doin a whole lot of ppl a favour by ripping this game. I have jericho already cos i downloaded the fulll version ages ago, the game sucks big time which a rip like you have down now is a big help to ppl wanting to check it out, for those ppl you have saved a lot of bandwidth and time thx for the upload, :)"
[V],Subzero!,2007-11-26T20:00Z,we'll see...

Seems strange to me there..I know that you got a very good CPU, but ""Subzero"" wrote what witch V-cards are working..ATI Radeon X1600, X1800, X1900, X1950, HD2900.
NVIDIA GeForce 6600, 6800, 7100, 7300, 7600, 7800, 7900, 7950, 8800. I am sure that you have looked at it.

Anyway the ""TOED.REG. file"" should have been there...When you downloaded it ,did you have a lot of ""harsch faults???"" Maybe it got corrupted in the long run..
Agaiea PshyX drivers are needed as well...I dont need to tell you that because i know that you got knowledge far more than many here..

Ok lets try this ""iamreadyforanything2009""
Erase it and make a good clean up at your registry..Mover the folder to  C: drive/ games,even if you are seeding...You can always move it back later...Sometimes it aint working because you have to many search words when it launches...C:/games/desktop/my ??/Jericho...Now try to extract again..
If you are not getting past throught it then you have to download it again if you cant handle the piece by piece replacing.. This is a mystery so far but we will figured it out no worries there mate..
I dont have the game myself. In worst scenario i will download it so i can have a look on it..

Let me know how it goes for you...I ll be here for a while.


YOUR CHOISE

,iamreadyforanything2009,2008-07-28T20:00Z,"@WTC-SWE-

Tried the moving it and all that, and there are noty alot of hashfails, and I know that it is not the game, because Some people are saying it works fine, but there is no TOED.REG, and my Video Card can handle it it I know that, but I dont know if it is SUPPORTED:( 

Well, dont strain yourself too hard, if it doesnt work I will seed it today and delete it, if you figure it out pleases share it with me!

ironic huh, here we are helping others, and even we need help sometimes LOL ;)
Anyways, any help of yours is much appreciated:)

Hi mate...How about downloading it again? I mean it might work for you..but if you are tired of trying then ok...It pisses me of when i cant help you out. 
To be hounest i think that your card is not supported...even if it is a great one you have!!

I had a similar problem not v-card with TIMESHIFT.....I had to download it again and clean the registry..Third attempt worked out for me....Anyway i know how frustrated you must feel.  I am consedering to download the game myself so i can figure out how to help you.
Nice to hear from you my freind as always..Keep it up..Bye for now!!!

This is the only torrent of yours I will not seed on!

It is SHIT!!!!
Fuck this this torrent, man!

I deleted it and it took like 1 hour to send to the recycle bin and 30+mins, to empty to recycle bin with it in there and then I got a crazy error message on my screen every time I started windows syaing that Windows has encountered a proble and needs to restart, and it goes to the balck screen...
FUCK THIS TORRENT, All your other ones are great, but not this one, THX for everything else!!!!

@WTC-SWE-
Thanks anyways mate, I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ATTEMPTS TO HELP A FELLOW PIRATE...
But no need to worry any longer , this torrents GONE NOW!!!

Dont worry mate, I wasn't talkin shit on you, and I know that you wouldn't purpously put a virus of ANY KIND in toyur U\L's, I KNOW THIS!!:)

But, I did get some weird shit happening, and the torrent did not work but I think that WTC-SWE is right and my 8500GT 512 MB probably is not supported, but on your mass effect release, it said the 8500 was not supported and the game wroks great! so I dont know, but I wanted to clear that up so you wouldn't think wrongly of it, and I have respect for you and your EVERY U\L!  So THX for everything else my friend, your hard work is greatly appreciated from my end...!!!:)

@WTC-SWE-

THX again mate, I do appreciate it, and sadly my V-card is not supported:(, even though on sysreqlab.com it says it is, but that site is sometimes incorrect I guess, But THX a MILLION!!!
And favor for favor pal!!!
Anything you need just ask!!!;)
