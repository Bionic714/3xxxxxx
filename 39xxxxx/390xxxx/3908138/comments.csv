Connect360 automatically indexes your iTunes and iPhoto libraries and shares them to your Xbox 360. You can then use the Xbox 360 Dashboard to browse and play your media, organized in the exact same way that it is on your Mac."

FYI, the torrent is fine though, just my network must have something wrong that i cant connect to my xbox."

,tetoforce,2007-12-04T00:06Z,"works great!

,bmcclure937,2008-04-29T00:09Z,"Does anyone know how to activate the most recent version of Connect 360?? When downloaded from Nullriver's site it is a trial version. It asks for an 'activation code' to activate it and make it the full version... there is no time when it asks for a Name and Serial, rendering this Keygen useless.

Help?"
