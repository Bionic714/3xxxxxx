,Ncl8,2008-10-13T12:12Z,For some reason this version is missing the light block
,deviant00,2009-04-01T23:54Z,"The NXT kit does not have a light, and thus no light block. Download the classic blocks from mindstorms.lego.com if you need them."

,Schlauncha,2009-07-20T05:59Z,"FUCK THOSE FUCKING WHORES AT LEGO that want you to pay $80 just for this software!  WTF it's not like anyone can do anything with this software if they DIDN'T BUY A ROBOT FROM LEGO so I don't see why this isn't free in the first place.

It's like if a company wanted you to pay for the drivers for your computer hardware!  And then to pay another $80 each time they come up with an update!  And each update still has bugs and will eventually get updated again anyways!  What a greedy money pit these WHORES at LEGO have going!  FUCK THEM I will make sure to post the new 2.0 software as soon as I get a copy, even if I have to buy it myself.  FUCK LEGO and their policy of giving a big greedy middle finger to the people who want updates for the expensive robot systems they bought from them."
