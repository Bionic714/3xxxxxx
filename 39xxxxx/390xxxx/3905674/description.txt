This torrent includes the original, unpatched, clean L2_Interlude_Live_Client.zip plus 2 more files: 
A system and a hosts patcher for my private server, l2wz.com.



You may use this, without my system or hosts patcher, to play on any server.



If you want to try my server just put one of the files included inside Lineage II directory.
Use system or hosts patcher. Hosts prefered. 
Then execute the exe to extract inside Lineage II direcory not system!

And seed :)
