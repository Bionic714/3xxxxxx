Dont be offended.. i didnt intend to offended.. I apologise. :)We all get screwed by our governments so lets not do what they do(keep us hanging on for more)Life is about sharing yea.. you do that,but share it faster.Pass the link on and you do a bigger favour to your bros and sisters yea?Or do your prefer gloating on your own upload power to pirate.And by the way i am no way related to the site,i just found it surfing a year or so ago.Peace..namaste :) "

,wintesa,2007-11-30T07:43Z,"Share when you have something to share, similarly speak when you have something to say."
