East meets West, and ancient myth meets modernity in this 
creature feature from Korean director Hyung Rae Shim (REPTILIAN).

old Korean legend coming to life. A giant snake is slithering its way through the streets of Los Angeles, and the trio must keep it from reuniting with an ancient spirit that will turn it into an evil, even more destructive dragon.

Cast: Jason Behr, Robert Forster, Amanda Brooks, Aimee Garcia.
