As far as I know its 2007 now. So if he writes ""1999 - with Christopher Lambert"" its pretty obvious that its not the new movie."
,andribesti,2007-11-29T01:54Z,Thanks will be nice to see old 1 to compare to new one :)
,doc_7_2,2007-12-05T20:48Z,"Hey larry52 ,
If you upload all your Leprechaun movies I will go and get and upload part 5 for you....

let me know"
,adamkatt,2007-12-08T18:06Z,"this movie was cheesy, but hey they at least added big titty biatches topsless for us to look at!

mr lambert has gone downhill since highlander.."
,Faloma,2008-04-10T07:22Z,"I love Lambert as an actor.  I mean Highlander rocked, well at least the first couple movies. Not to mention his small appearances in Mortal Combat as Lord Rayden, and a few other B movie thrillers.

 Little off note since if you like this film you probably would find it pretty cool that a new Mortal Combat Film is in production (set to come out 2010) and again Lambert plays Lord Rayden.

But is the best Beowulf Movie out there by far! I was so worried will all the crap from the new one I would never be able to find this one again.

again on a little side note Rhona Mitra is damn sexy!!! (if anyone doesn't know who that is she is  Lamberts love interest in this movie and the recent Heroin in the movie Doomsday that came out a few weeks ago) even though it was just Resident Evil in a different package she is still hot in both films."
,akis007,2008-11-27T14:22Z,"Good  movie i was looking for this,i seen the animation one  that is good also, good actors in this one.
Is it posible in 1080p with gr and ru subs?"
,restless3,2011-02-08T05:11Z,I have this one on VHS and was looking to put it on DVD. Thanks.
,CJClags,2012-06-06T01:14Z,Good to see the original still on here. Even in its cheesy old school style it is still better than that terribly boring remake. Thanks!
