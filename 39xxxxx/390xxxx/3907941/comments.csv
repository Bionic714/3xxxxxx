,FlightSimerr,2007-11-27T02:42Z,"LOL Yeah the fscene website says all five seasons so thats what i put. Not wanting to deal with people on here telling me ""the website says five seasons, how come your torrent only has 4?"" ha,... I guess there's always some one to complain. 

who knows, maybe in asia there is five seasons..."
,FlightSimerr,2007-11-27T02:45Z,Has anyoen tested it on FS2004 yet? i only have fsx. Just curious so that people with fs2004 have it available also. Thanks!

,palmofsweden,2007-11-28T15:16Z,I forgot to mention a Thank you!
,Arrow-IV,2008-05-26T05:33Z,"well, obviously you don't develop much for FS. Flight Sim for ages has used 5 seasons, the first 4 being obvious: spring, summer, fall, and winter, and they also include hard winter (basically december-january in northern hemispere)

Thanks a bunch for the torrent :)"
