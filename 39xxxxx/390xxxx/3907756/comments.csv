In Transmission you can choose ( use the inspector option ) which of the files you want to download and which one you don't.

@ all others

Download the 3.8gig torrent of FCS and install all the apps in english then with this torrent choose only the content ... not the apps and you'll have FCS in english.... The

I'm using utorrent 1.7.7 and the check mark is green. I've done everything in the speed test, and I've even enabled encription. I've turned off the Windows firewall and disables UPnP on my router.

First email me and let me know and then you will have to send my a pack of DVD +R DL disk so that I can get you a backup copy of the program. Once you email me, I will get you the address where to send the disk. Do not contact me if you are not serious. This is not a scam, just a tech who believe in sharing.


Let keep sharing alive and Greedy person broke.
