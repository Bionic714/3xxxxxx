when the police saw the unedited footage the wanted the charge channel 4 instead. this is as factual as J.F.K."

,rockstar11998,2008-05-09T18:55Z,"This is an excellent video about how evil fundamental Islam is.  These are religious leaders giving it straight how they hate Jews, Non-Muslims, and that they want to take over the world through Jihad.  They use brainwashing and hate speech to get their followers wound up and use all sorts of lies and propaganda to get them to think they are superior and that they will be rewarded for killing non-believers.  Satan has done a great job at deceiving so many Muslims into thinking good is evil and evil is good."
,Wake_Up.,2008-11-11T04:57Z,"No religion or society has been as responsible as Islam for invasions, intolerance, genocide, massacre, civil war, annihilation of other cultures, abuse of women and children, persecution of non-believers, and general inhumanities.
Islam as a religion or belief system should at least decrease these problems, and yet it has failed like none other. Instead Islam has been used to justify and magnify human evil for 1500 years.

At the very least Islam has not proven a reasonable model for civilized success.
Islamic countries are constantly in civil war.
Islamic countries have either no tolerance for non-Islamic beliefs or brutally subjugate non-Muslims.
Islamic countries demonstrate the worst abuse of women.
Freedom of speech doesn't exist.
Wherever Islam goes all non-Islamic culture and belief is destroyed. Art, libraries, architecture, are all destroyed if non-Islamic.

The most extreme slaughter and suppression of critics & dissenters:
Hitler's Nazi Germany,
Stalin's Communist Russia,
Mao's Communist China,
Pol Pot's Communist Khmer Rouge,
Mussolini's Fascist Italy.
Saddam's Islamic Iraq,
Khomeini's Islamic Iran,
Omar's Islamic Taliban,
Abd al-Wahhab & Ibn Saud's Islamic Arabia, and
Tamerlane's Islamic Asia,

These empires fit together like puzzle pieces.

Islam has always been a fertile ground for the rise of ultra extremist militant fascist movements.
Wherever Islam goes in the world violent militant extremists magically appear as well.
These problems find their roots in the books, teachings and examples of Islamic leaders from the very beginning.

And don't try to apologize for these fascist Islamic empires by saying every country has it's problems; it would be like apologizing for Ted Bundy & Jeffrey Dahmer by claiming everybody has their problems.
