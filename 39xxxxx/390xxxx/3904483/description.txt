Meet the Gimp! is a weekly video podcast or tutorial about the Gimp graphics software from the viewpoint of a digital photographer. More information at http://meetthegimp.org

Gimp can produce animated GIF files. Itâ??s easy, if you understand that each layer is one image in a stack. It is shown for a short time and then replaced by the next one.

This time there are no files for downloading - just â??stealâ?? them from http://meetthegimp.org as described in the video. Explore the annoying one on top of this entry, it uses the â??optimizationâ?? option youâ??ll find in the animation menue. It didnâ??t made the show, but youâ??ll find your way around.

Visit the Blog â??Linux for Photographersâ?? , even if you are using an other OS. He has a lot to share about photography and Open Source programs.

On the meetthegimp.org group at 23 is a thread about an Adventskalender. This is an old German tradition and you are invited to join the fun.

The panorama challenge from show 19 is open until mid december. Build a panorama and put it online in the photogroup. Itâ??s free - and you even can win a bit.

Iâ??ll take a break from making this videos from mid December to mid January. In this time Iâ??ll think about how to improve the show. I would be glad about your input - either here in the comments or by mail at info@meetthegimp.org. What did you like? What was missing? What did annoy you?
