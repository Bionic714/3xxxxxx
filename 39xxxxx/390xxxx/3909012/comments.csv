a seeder is someone who uploads the data
a leecher is domeone who want to download this data, when the data is finished downloading you'll automattically become a sedder( if you don't stop the torrent of course)

,bakagaijin79,2011-12-22T23:25Z,"Question for ya, I dl'd this game I have the first one. After dl'ing I ran it through rarzilla, went perfect like any other game. Well as normal all in a neat little folder, however I do not see how to start and play the game. It has 3 files I dunno what to do with a SAV, MDF and a MDS, other than that are the walk throughs and a jpeg. So...how do you play this thing? Perhaps I'll try re un rar'ing it into another folder, still I doubt that will do any good be great to hear some thing on this prob."
