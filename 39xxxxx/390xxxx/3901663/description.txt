This is a silent film, hence, there is no spoken language.  The dialog cards in between the visuals are in english.  This is actually both Spiders 1 and Spiders 2.  Spiders 3 and 4 were intended to be sequels, but were never done by Fritz Lang.

Interesting.  Somewhat bizarre.  Fritz Lang's work on this movie prevented him from working on the classic, "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari".

This is a DVD rip.  The audio is of excellent quality, but since it is a silent film, please don't complain that the audio dialog is missing.

From the IMDB:

A desperate, haggard-looking man puts a message into a bottle, and is able to throw it into the sea just as he is shot by an arrow. Some time later, well-known sportsman Kay Hoog announces to a large audience that he has found the message, which tells of a lost civilization that possesses an immense treasure. Hoog immediately plans an expedition to find it. But Lio Sha, the head of a criminal organization known as the Spiders, plans her own expedition, and she is determined to get the treasure for herself.  Written by Snow Leopard
