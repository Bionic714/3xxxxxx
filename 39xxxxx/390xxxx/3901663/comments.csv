,TheFirstMan,2007-11-21T02:21Z,"Thanx! I collect everything Fritz Lang. Needed this for my collection. Too bad only Metropolis, M, and The Testament of Dr. Mabuse are available in my country."
,TheFirstMan,2007-11-21T02:25Z,So were the Spiders 3 and 4 sequels ever made by another director?
,worthajob,2007-11-21T09:33Z,thanks - lookng for Man Hunt pls
,DogNo7,2007-11-21T23:53Z,"Spiders 3 and 4 were never done.

I don't know if any writing or ideas were fleshed out.  If you check out the imdb entry referenced at the top of this description, under IMDB, the entry details the proposed titles for the next two movies."
,DogNo7,2007-11-22T00:00Z,"Also of interest, for some reason, these were edited differently for the German audience, so the German versions of these have less material than in the English language versions.

Strange.  I have no idea why.  I can only make the supposition that perhaps elements of the movie touch on certain political topics which are forbotten in Germany...???"
,DogNo7,2007-11-22T07:46Z,"Coming up, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Check out my torrents tomorrow or the next day.

,DogNo7,2007-11-23T03:44Z,"I was mistaken in my earlier comment.  The IMDB has squat on the history of this film.

The beginning of the film provides a short history of Fritz Lang's work on Spiders, and gives the names of the other two films that were intended to follow as sequels.

Wikipedia has this on Lang:

,zeinabqureshi,2008-03-14T18:50Z,"Pretty lavish details on Lang. (One small point: Is Lang so important as a director? I've watched half a dozen of his movies, they are all good, bu, just like Kurosawa, there's nothing exceptional about these films. Compared to DW Griffith of Eisenstein or Murnau, Lang seems to be pretty ordinary... of course this is what I feel. I'm not a Lang researcher. I also admit that 'M' is a terrific film. I also like the Nibelungenlied.)"
,DogNo7,2010-07-09T22:37Z,"I think one has to look at the time these films were released in to appreciate their importance in film techniques that were later mainstays.nnThis film is really not that important, or significant, other than it was done by Lang.nnCabinet of Dr. Caligari, directed by Weine is definitely a more significant film by a German director.nnOf Lang\'s work, Metropolis was, is, and will always be an interesting critique of industrialization, and the rabid pursuit of productivity in the workplace, at the cost of the sanity and health of the worker.nnPolitically, I have no comment on how I feel about the message of Metropolis.  As art, the film speaks for itself.nnThe Spiders is mainly interesting for the reason I state in the movie description, that Lang gave up the chance to do \""Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\"".nnHistory and time have unquestionably answered which was the more significant film for the time.n"
