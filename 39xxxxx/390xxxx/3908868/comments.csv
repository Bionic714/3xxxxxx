thanks for the music. As for the missing Telemann Track, I tried to upload 3 times... my connection is lousy, the file never showed. 
If you have a PO Box, I could put the file on a DVD and mail it (if nobody else uploads). 
Also, since I can't launch torrents, I could also give you my collection of over 40 baroque operas (Cavalli, Charpentier, Conradi, Gluck, Graun, Handel, Hasse, Keiser, Lully, Monteverdy, Purcell, Telemann, Vivaldi) with the request to upload. They are all nice quality mp3 (mostly 256kbs)
If this is ok, contact me at margitng@hotmail.com
Everybody please note: I only read mails from names I recognise from TPB

Also, does anybody have Charpentier: Medee and Lully: Armide, Atys, Thesee or Roland as mp3?"
