REQ: FSDreamTeam ZĂźrich for FSX.
PleasePlease! :)"

Simple: Just start the installer, then, before clicking next, go to C:\Users\Yourname\AppData\Local\Temp\.

Be sure its an empty directory! When you click there should be a file somewhere named ascrypt.dll. Replace with the provided. Click next and forget about registration. You're done!

Hope this helps."
