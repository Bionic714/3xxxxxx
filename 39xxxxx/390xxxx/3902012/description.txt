Two hard rocking albums from merciless Lizard during the Capitol records years. They hold a universe and doesn┬┤t come easy, but try listen and enjoy! A hell of a band at that time and still is! Some bands wont get old, they just go another way. Cobain loved them - of course! So will you, with a little sweat and pain.
