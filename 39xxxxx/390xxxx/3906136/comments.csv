,leesmith1970,2007-11-25T20:57Z,SORRY THIS IS TAKING SO LONG TO UPLOAD MY IP PROVIDER ONLY GIVES ME A FAST SPEED BETWEEN 8 AT NIGHT AND 6 IN THE MORNING AND THERE IS SO MANY TRYING TO DOWNLOAD THE FILE BE PATIENT AND HOPEFULLY A COUPLE OF DAYS SHOULD DO IT AM LEAVING MY COMPUTER ON FOR HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES AND I HOPE OTHERS WILL CONTINUE SEEDING AS WELL CHEERS
,richto,2007-11-25T22:40Z,"Ummh you did DECRYPT this before uploading it from the DVD?

I notice that its the raw files from the DVD rather than a proper disk image which rather implies that you dont know what you are doing...."
,leesmith1970,2007-11-26T16:10Z,yes it is decrypted and at end of day disc image or raw files still contain same amout of data so what is the difference 
,richto,2007-11-27T17:01Z,Its rather easier to just burn an image file than to have to muck around with seperate files of course. Thats why all proper releases are images.
,leesmith1970,2007-11-27T23:16Z,ITS ALSO EASIER TO PLAY DVD STRAIGHT AWAY ON YOUR PC WITH DVD FILES AND ANY GOOD BURNING PROGRAM LIKE YOUR NERO 8 WILL AUTOMATICALLY FORMAT DVD FILES IN ORDER AND BURN THEM JUST AS EASY AS AN IMAGE PERSONALLY I PREFER FILES PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO USE UNLESS YOU ARE A NOVICE WHO DOESN`T KNOW HOW TO BURN DVD FILES DIRECT TO DVD AS IT IS SOOOOO MUCH HARDER TO DO THAN A IMAGE FILE 
,leesmith1970,2007-11-27T23:18Z,PS IF YOU DON`T LIKE DVD FILES DOWNLOAD THIS OF SOMEONE ELSE WHO ONLY KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING BY UPLOADING IMAGE FILES OH SORRY ITS ONLY US NOVICES WHO HAVE WENT TO THE BOTHER OF DOING IT 
,barratt23,2007-11-28T12:36Z,"Wow some people are really ungrateful, whats it matter if its a image or files, they both do the same thing? i for one am greatful, my little un loves this show, tried Ebat as i didnt think it would be on torrents and it was 12 quid :O so many thanks

One thing? dont suppose you have or know where i can get the covers for this

Thanks again "
,leesmith1970,2007-11-28T21:31Z,WISH I KNEW LOOKING FOR COVERS MYSELF GOT IT OFF A COPY DISC WITH NO IMAGE ON IT AND WAS LOOKING FOR A DISC IMAGE TO DO IT UP FOR THE KIDS HOPEFULLY SOMEONE WILL UPLOAD ONE TO CDCOVERS OR ONE OF THE OTHER SITES SOON HOPE EVERYONE ENJOYS IT AS MY SON IS MAD ABOUT MAKKA PAKKA AND HE MAKES A COUPLE OF GOOD APPEARANCES IN THIS DVD 
,louisceline,2007-12-01T21:26Z,"Many thanks sir- I find it crazy that some clowns will criticize peoples hard work....the same cunts dont say thanks when you open a door for them or let them through whilst driving...fuck em ,they will get what they deserve.

Many thanks leesmith1970 from me & my little boy (who loves it)
It took over a day to download which is as good as any other 4GB file i've downed from the Bay.

@richto
please go download from elsewhere you fu*king retard & don't leave decent uploaders your useless comments. There is no need to decrypt you fool. Easier to burn from image???? it sounds like you don't know what your doing RETARD!
Your only upload on TPB is NERO which burns disc images & VOB files with no difference, you simply select the files to burn in Nero & burn!!!!!!!!!
SOME PEOPLE!!!"

for  all the peopple who complain, maybe they should go and buy the DVD. I'm sure that is much easier than having to burn  the files it on a disc, ja ja.

,purene,2009-05-31T12:14Z,thnx man bairn will love this
,Yurn,2009-06-04T02:51Z,"A proper DVD image has all the advantages so STFU and don't be lazy to learn how to make one properly BEFORE uploading.

And since this is a copy of a copy (the copy was probably a SCENE release anyway) it's SHIT in any case because you don't know where it's been and how many times it's been transcoded.

So STFU and GET A CLUE."
,roboro,2009-08-12T12:53Z,yurn dont be so fuckin dis respectful to people that go to this much effort sharing so you WISE UP!!!
,Wezzy101,2010-02-10T20:59Z,"thanks m8 perfect, dont even have to recode this :D straight to dvd without a pain in the arse wait.
