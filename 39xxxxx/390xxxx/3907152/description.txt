Dr. Gene Scott warned that once he died, those who took over the church
would destroy his entire life work.  This was because his teachings frequently went
into territory far beyond what one would normally expect from a Christian preacher.  Indeed, he spent much time educating his listeners on subjects which were highly politically sensitive even to this day, and he knew that only he himself could guarantee the continued availability of his teachings.

His prophecy has unfortunately been fulfilled.  Dr. Scott's widow Melissa Scott has removed all of Dr. Scott's important material from public availability, and has correctly stated on public television that "there are forces which do not want to see Dr. Scott's memory embedded in time." 

Now if you go to his church, all you will see will be Melissa prancing around on stage, if you can get in the door at all.   The church is guarded by a virtual army of private security goons masquerading as "ushers," wearing three-piece suits and ear-phone communication systems.   This has all the earmarkings of a government-sponsored cult operation, working as expected to mind-control its followers and destroy the truth.  
  
Melissa Scott is ABUSING her ownership of the copyright to this material as a means to DESTROY AND ERASE the life work of Dr. Gene Scott from the face of the Earth.  We feel that Dr. Scott did not produce his lifetime of work simply so that his former porn-producer wife Melissa aka "Barbie Bridges" could shut it all down the moment he passed on, in order to appease her handlers.  Dr. Scott's work rightfully belongs to the world now, and so we are making it available to everyone free of charge.
