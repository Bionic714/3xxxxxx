Error: 3
The system cannot find the path specified

What's the issue? I have nero 6 installed already on my pc and the serial key is picked up in the install."
,icemanms,2008-02-11T05:18Z,It appears that this version is missing files. Don't bother downloading it.

I tried loading this software to  C:\programs after I couldn't load it conventionally and it wiped all the Data off my hard drive.

This is obviously malware"

If you try to install this as described it will wipe out your Nero files in C:\programs.

Both the supporting comments and the number of seeders is dubious in may opinion.
