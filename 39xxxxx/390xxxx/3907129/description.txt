Jeff Dunham is a master ventriloquist, and while no one will say he's perfect (no one is) he is really funny. The puppets make this 'good' comedian into a top tier comedian. Here you will find his first two (and currently only) Comedy Central TV specials from DVD: 'Arguing with Myself' and 'Sparks of Insanity'. Samples included for your viewing pleasure (also a first from me).
