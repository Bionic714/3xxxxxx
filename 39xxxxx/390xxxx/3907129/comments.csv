,mondeo98,2008-02-08T19:51Z,OMG both shows drilled down to 2.78 GB. That's just rape in it's purest form ! He should be viewed in full DVD quality !
,DolphWulff,2008-02-27T22:20Z,"Sorry to have to say this, but I'm amazed that you can get this crappy quality out of such an insanely oversized release. It's 2h30m in total, it's 2.78 GB XviD, and it looks like a piece of toilet paper with shit smeared all over it. How the hell did you do that? I never seen a ""Bloated, yet crap quality"" check button on the XviD codec settings, but you sure found it."
[T],2Crazy4u,2008-04-19T03:40Z,"Those people who doubt the quality of these should BUY the DVD's and note that the DVD quality is the same.

Or better yet ... go piss off."
