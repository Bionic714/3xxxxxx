Adhering closely to Dashiel Hammett's story, sleazy detective Sam Spade seeks the whereabouts of a jewel encrusted statuette and his partner's cold-blooded killer, unaware the two quests may be related. Well received in its time, today it looks like a dress-rehearsal for John Huston's definitive version made ten years later.  Written by Sister Grimm {srgrimm@teleport.com}
