Shade Empire was formed in Kuopio, Finland late 1999. They released three demos which were all highly acclaimed, receiving only positive response from the press around the world. At last their third demo woke up the true interest of record companies and Shade Empire was signed to Italian Avantgarde Music.

Shade Empire released their debut album "Sinthetic" in 2004. For their first album these young Finns introduced a very orchestrated, yet electronic dark/black metal, far away from all the average bands. This powerful mixture of melody and hate earned many great reviews worldwide and pushed their recognizable sound to wider audience.
