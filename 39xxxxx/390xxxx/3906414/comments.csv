[T],Dark_Swordsman,2007-11-24T03:23Z,"I Ripped These Off Vinly LPs and Love Them A Lot, Specially The Judith Blegen With Gerald Schwartz. This Has Never Been Put Out In CD and when the Vinyl LPs Die Then The Music Dies Because The Corporate Entity Wont Issue Them In CD Probably Becaause of The Legal Crap. Look For More of My Classical vinyl Rips of My Favorite Artists....Coming Soon To A pirate Bay Near You.
