Madrid - Bob Dylan has become the voice and the face of Expo Zaragoza 2008, recording a new rendition of his song 'A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall' for the international exposition that will focus on conservation and environmental issues. 

The song, a Spanish-language version of which is being recorded by pop group Amaral, forms the soundtrack to a new publicity campaign for the expo unveiled yesterday in Madrid. 

"It underscores the goals of the expo, particularly protecting natural resources and sustainable development," Roque Gistau, the president of Expo Zaragoza, told reporters in a press conference. 

The publicity campaign is due to be launched in December to raise awareness about the event, which will run from June 14 to September 14 next year. 

Johanna Jackson, a Dylan representative, said the US singer-songwriter views the Zaragoza expo as the ideal platform to raise global awareness about protecting natural resources.
