August Underground's Penance: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0971183/"
,iAmNoTcRaZy,2007-11-21T04:35Z,"""Jag varnar känsliga personer för dessa filmer!"" menar jag. Lite trött nu."
,amstel1,2007-11-30T16:30Z,"Could you speak english iAmNoTcRaZy?
I dont understand swedish very well.
I watched all of these movies before and i deleted them after. Now i want them back, because i understand that these are one of a kind shit and not that typical hollywood shit.
Props to Tag Toe crew. Thanks for the torrent
iAmNoTcRaZy. Btw you dont have to be sicko to watch these. You are real sicko if you enjoy watching...."
,iAmNoTcRaZy,2007-12-02T01:41Z,"Sorry I didn't write in English, guess I was just lazy... Here's a translation for ya:

August Underground (2001), resolution 320x240
August Underground's Mordum (2003), resolution 512x384
August Underground's Penance (2007), resolution 576x320

Some of the sickest films you can see when it comes to horror movies. The first movie was only printed in 1000 copies, and is both expensive and hard to find. Viewer discretion is advised!"
,n1nj4Lo,2008-04-19T04:43Z,"Thankz iAmNoTcRaZy
After reading : [url]http://severed-cinema.com//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=22&Itemid=26[/url] and [url]http://severed-cinema.com//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=121&Itemid=26[/url] then I believe I found a great find for a horror fan friend of mine, I'm gettin these for him to see might watch them with him but IDK sounds to sickening for me but I wanna see if we both can stomach these.. I'm already getting Porn of The Dead and The Texas Vibrator Massacre jus for laughs and giggles of two popular horror movies turned into porn.. But this AU sounds like something totally way different than those two movies..."
,iAmNoTcRaZy,2008-04-19T22:21Z,"Well, n1nj4Lo
To put it simple, you gotta be really twisted to get turned on by any scenes from these movies. This is basically a dramatized version of a snuff movie."
,WizardOfTheMind,2008-07-11T18:08Z,no seriously plz seed :(
,Lord_Mrakainus_of_Ulda,2008-07-17T02:48Z,"Fuck yeah, I've always wanted to see these crazy films! Please Seed!"
,unclewozi,2008-08-17T18:23Z,Have been stuck at 86% since August 14th. Can someone seed. Cheers guys.
,iAmNoTcRaZy,2008-09-24T23:25Z,"I'll be seeding these for a little more while. If you enjoy them, I hope I can leave the responsibility to you to continue seeding. Thanks."
,SUMMAT,2008-10-24T10:06Z,"Hey, whats with the annoying commentary in the first one? It's really bothering me, I can't stand it."
,lwpjb,2008-12-03T03:12Z,"I'm in Penance... Haven't seen this since it was finished. Thanks for uploading. 
"
,Steven2,2010-05-09T06:52Z,"Yeah, the commentary in the first one is really annoying. i watched the first 45 seconds or so and it really took away from the supposed realism when you hear someone talking about how they wanted this to be a sick movie... I'll be downloading the third one though (I already have the second)."
,Armoreska_,2010-07-03T11:22Z,"What are you people watching in WMP or something? Use a good player noobs.

Yeah there's an optional commentary."
,jasoncoutu7,2011-05-16T03:30Z,well i enjoy watching them does that mean im a sicko amstel 1 ??? dont be a hater its art understand
,St_Frank,2011-08-07T08:52Z,"They're not exactly hard to get. You can buy the special edition DVD of the first August Underground movie from the Toetag official store. 

You can get the other two there, as well! You can even choose to have them autographed by the filmmaker! :)

But, thanks for the upload!"
,giggidyp,2012-02-25T08:14Z,"WTF!! this is some low budget sick-ass SHIT!!!!
