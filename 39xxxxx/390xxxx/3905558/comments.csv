[T],splattergod,2007-12-01T11:11Z,"Hey chizzer666
I see what's wrong with the other torrents-
For some reason it downloads simply as a ""file"" instead of a rar-
all you have to do is rename the file into .rar (make sure you put the ""dot"" before the rar)
This will make it into a rar file and it can be opened-
I do this all the time with downloads, and it works every time-
Cheers
