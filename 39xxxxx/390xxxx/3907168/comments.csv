,iggy.stooge,2007-11-24T18:16Z,What kind of file is that? Cant figure out how to opn it or with what? (Got a mac and not anything with windows :) )
,chizzer666,2007-11-24T18:23Z,"it should open with winrar or winace
hope it works this is my first time doing torrents"
,iggy.stooge,2007-11-24T19:23Z,"All the other Pistols gig you put up worked just fine but this one seems to be some kind of file that unrarX (that goes with Mac) doesnt understand what to do with.

I will try to download it once more."
,iggy.stooge,2007-11-24T19:29Z,"Actually it was the same with Welcome to the rodeo too, I didnt checked it properly. My program to do rar-files claims that its not a rar-archive at all. But I dont know if Im the only one with this problem?"
,chizzer666,2007-11-24T22:48Z,"can someone leave a comment if this has worked or not
this is my first time uploading and allready someone has said baton rouge and rodeo are not working
cheers chizzer666"
,iggy.stooge,2007-11-24T23:20Z,Or maybe just quit raring the files since they are pretty small anyhow :)
[T],splattergod,2007-12-01T11:09Z,"Hey chizzer666
I see what's wrong with the other torrents-
For some reason it downloads simply as a ""file"" instead of a rar-
all you have to do is rename the file into .rar (make sure you put the ""dot"" before the rar)
This will make it into a rar file and it can be opened-
I do this all the time with downloads, and it works every time-
Cheers
