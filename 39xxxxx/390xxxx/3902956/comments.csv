,billiegdjoe,2007-11-26T19:07Z,Why this is a bad torrent file ?
,tankdlspb,2007-12-18T05:37Z,How the hell am I supposed to get this thing to work in my PS2?!?
,dark_abyss,2008-04-06T01:31Z,Wow a 1.9 megabyte torrent files.... what the hell?
,DrXII,2008-05-16T10:12Z,"I dont think this is a bad torrent file , only for some reason huge...
if you wanna get this working , you can burn the disc into a dvd , or you can play it with a ps2 emulator on your pc...
Well i actually didnt download this one yet , but you can do the above with all ps2 games you download..."
,zip-it,2008-08-07T01:40Z,"The torrent file is bad dumb ass.

Its not the ISO, its the torrent link"
,ChronoX8299,2008-08-07T19:45Z,The link works just fine. I am using uTorrent ver. 1.7.7. and I am downloading this torrent as I write this. I had recently had an update for iTunes and included in the update was a browser called Safari. It is faster than Firefox and Internet Explorer. I like it. But yeah so far so good on the download.
,babylovechild,2008-08-17T19:18Z,"could anyone give me a semi-detailed tutorial on how to burn this game to a disc so i can play it? 
thanks."
,enddodays,2008-11-06T11:55Z,Google up something called a ps2 modchip(their are many types). Buy one and have it shipped to you. Install it in your ps2 (if you can't solder. Then get someone who can too). Next get a burning software that can burn an iso. I personally use Deep Burner cause it's free. Burn the iso to a disk(dvd-r for this game). Put in your modded ps2. Play. 
[T],Elbart,2008-11-16T21:14Z,"Thanks for the torrent, but...

2mb torrent-file, lol.

And this is the first archive, that I encounter, which is significantly bigger than its extracted content (archive: 3.261.138.769 bytes, content: 3.220.798.342 bytes).

,phrozenstare,2009-02-10T17:21Z,freakin losers they are not trying up open the ISO they are trying to exact it and unable to because it is saying the file is broken
,phrozenstare,2009-02-10T17:25Z,and it looks like the problem is they are using something other than winrar to extract it because i was getting errors extracting the file with 7zip
,Undeadgod,2009-04-24T15:52Z,is it undub?
,SeedLeechPirate,2009-05-24T00:58Z,"ke noobies.. don't try to extract the .iso file.

I just finished downloading, burned to a dvd, and it runs fine on my modded ps2.

Thanks Billiegdjoe for the upload.



Quick tutorial on how to:

1: Get a free torrent client (like utorrent or bitcomet) (find it on google).

2: Click on this page on ""download this torrent""

3: Open with your torrentclient, and it will download (leech) the file.

4: Once the file is at 100 completed, go to your download folder. 
Usually C:/My Documents/Downloads

5: Get a dvd burning program like Nero or imgburn (also find it on google or tpb).

6: Burn the .ISO file you just downloaded with this onto a dvd, preferably on a low writing speed like 4x for better results.

7: Stick the dvd in your modded ps2 (if it aint modded it aint playin it).

8: Did what I told ya? Works right? Enjoy.

Theres like a million people that already wrote all that ^ somewhere else.. next time use GOOGLE!"

To get this game to work on your ps2 after downloading the torrent file follow the given steps as:
1.Unrar the rar file using winrar 
2.You will get multiple rar files, try to unrar the first file by right clicking on it and selecting the option 'Extract to specified folder'.
3.The whole game would be extracted into the specified folder in about 10 mins.
4.After extraction is complete u will get two files 'iso and mds'.
5.Use alcohol 120% to burn mds file not iso as doing so wont enable u to run the game on your ps2.
6.For burning u will need a dvd burner and a blank dvd, make sure to burn at lowest speed possible i.e 4x."
,wolverine19389,2009-07-26T11:39Z,"By the way one thing i would like to add if for some reason u cant burn the game using mds extension e.g if u have deleted the original files before burning follow the following steps:
1.Copy the iso to the desktop not the mds.
2.Use alcohol or other software to burn the iso from desktop.
3.After burning is complete play the game in your modded ps2 and enjoy.
By the way for those of you who wanted to know in which language the game is dubbed, its NTSC-U and is in English."
,Me_Lothar,2010-01-17T06:32Z,Why are there 65 rar files in a rar file?  Which iso do I use?
,AztrullGray,2010-10-11T00:39Z,"noob haven here hahahah
you need to select all the rar files and set to extract to same folder...it will rebuild the only iso file on the other side.... its broken up into smaller rars....   people here are nice enuf to share.. do some damn research on how to use these files"
