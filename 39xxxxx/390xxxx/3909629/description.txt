Ron Paul 2008 - Hope for America DVD (AVI/XVID)

Converted to XVID/1500/640x428.

Note: i've fixed several audio issues. Shifted the audio volume from a range
between very silent and overmodulated/distorted to a more constant level over
all parts including fixes within single files. At least you won't need medical
care after listening to this release..

Further fixes include minor audio interleaving corrections in several parts
as well as an attempted sample rate correction in "Television Interviews -
Conversation with the Candidate" (still not sure if this works better now).
I've rarely witnessed such badly engineered audio on a DVD release..

But what's more: watch this DVD to get to know about Ron Paul, who he is,
what he stands for, and why the people in America (and around the world)
want him to become the next president of the U.S.A.

Please seed!
