I've been looking everywhere for this so I just bought it! Very nice! ;D Please remember these upgrades are unit specific if you don't have a 3600 series Ipaq this is not for you. This is my first succesful upload let me know if it works ::)
 
Here is that hard to find WM2002 update for 3600 series Ipaqs if you don\'t have a 3600 do not attempt to use this or any other update not specific to your Pocket PC if you are unlucky enough to get the wrong update to work you will smoke your Ipaq! so be warned!! these files are clean and ready to use with the also hard to find win media player update & MS reader update not included in WM2003 I will try to seed as long as I can but I share my connection with others & must play nice(;
