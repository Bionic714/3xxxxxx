,jspec,2007-12-28T14:51Z,Plz seed!!
,tortugapaul,2008-01-26T06:28Z,I need someone to take over seeding the peeps I share the connection with are getting tired of the slow connection I show 30+ uploads please people help me keep this alive
,br0adband,2008-04-08T12:43Z,"While I was surprised to find this, it's easier to just dump it someplace like RapidShare or MegaUpload, Badongo, etc. It'll be useful as I have an iPAQ 3635 so let's hope this works. If it does, I'll dump it on RS, MU, Badongo, etc so others can acquire it in the future, but I can't seed it 24/7. Thanks..."
,huckfinnifkcuh,2008-05-22T22:01Z,Anyone know where I can find OS upgrade from CE to PPC2003 for 3600 series iPaq?  Anyassisstance would be wonderful!  Thanks!
,ELCouz,2008-05-28T10:55Z,"Dear members and uploader,

PLEASE UPLOAD TO RAPIDSHARE OR SEED PLZ :-)

I need this so much , i have just bought an ipaq h3635 which have Windows CE 3.0 i want to upgrade to this rare release :D

Have a nice day!"
,tortugapaul,2008-07-05T08:38Z,"Huck, The Ipaq 3600 never had a WM2003 update it was too slow and not enough memory or so I'm tols"
,urpotter,2008-08-17T10:33Z,Thanks for the upload :)
,br0adband,2008-09-02T02:42Z,Test
,br0adband,2008-09-02T02:43Z,"Great, now the damned server works... :D

Anyway...

My apologies, folks. Got sidetracked quite some time ago and forgot all about this... DOH!!!

Anyway, I slapped a new battery in my iPAQ 3635, went looking for this upgrade once again, found it, installed it, now the 3635 works great, slightly faster than it was with the old Windows CE crap and running WM2002 just fine.

Sooo... here's the RapidShare link I promised long ago. This version I'm linking you to is more complete, has more files and the Compaq tutorial as well.

Have fun, always...

ps
I mentioned where the file was located, so replace the x's..."
,Choose_76,2009-01-05T19:42Z,"Hello. I succesfully downloaded the file from the x place ;) but while going through the setup the app complains it cannot find the ROM image file and then exits. May it be possible that the ROM image is a hidden file and was not included in the rar file?

Thank you."
