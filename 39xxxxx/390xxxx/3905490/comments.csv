,noel777,2007-11-23T21:12Z,"I'm glad you like it stilljacktwenty. 

I also hope people buy the book as it has more, references to the exhaustive source documentation in particular, and because I would love to see Ms. Klein get rich rather than the criminals who are running my country (USA)...an because I feel a bit guilty.

,DucoNihilum,2007-11-29T16:04Z,"Wow.

This just proves that anyone can write a book about anything now, doesn't it? 

Fucking socialists...."
,noel777,2007-12-01T06:55Z,"You couldn't write it and apparently haven't read it judging by your base, erroneous comment, DucoNihilum."
,checksixb17,2007-12-03T02:40Z,"The real truth is starting to hit the fan in this country where the big money has moved jobs to the Middle East and China and now Asia.  The Karl Rove Republicans have done away with the constitution and the rule of law and now we are faced the the rule of the Corporations and the rich.  This is a fantastic read and I am really surprised that some biggot has not tried to assasinate the author!  Finally, as they say, the truth will come out but I am not sure that it will make us free."
,BurningR,2008-04-15T14:58Z,"Thank you. Already have the book, but don't have the time for it right now - instead I can listen to it while at work, nice!"
,Greeno225,2008-06-17T20:22Z,"Socialists just have the wrong answers for everything.

This woman and her blind followers are hilarious.

,andalemono,2008-07-24T09:30Z,"Greeno: you say ""Socialist"" like it's a bad thing.  You owe the socialist movement so much. Read and learn so you can stop being an idiot."
,american_no.421,2008-09-03T14:57Z,Why has anyone even mentioned socialism?
,InfoWarmonger,2008-09-22T21:41Z,I don't see what this has to do with socialism.
,Ola435345345,2008-12-11T23:06Z,Yeiiii !!!! T H X !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Dudde987,2009-01-04T22:25Z,"Gr8t upload, but this is only the first two parts of the book. The book is in seven parts, see pdf on TPB also. Anybody have the FULL audiobook as well?"
,savarz,2009-06-09T21:32Z,Great post! thank you!
,toovygrodger,2009-08-17T13:07Z,Thank you for sharing this - much appreciated! :)
,hrmitcrb,2010-02-02T13:39Z,"You won't hear about the topics examined in this book on Fox 'News.'  Wake up, follks.  Thanks to noel777 for an excellent upload."
,MitziKatz,2010-04-08T23:07Z,"Thanks for a highly interesting book. I believe the author is mostly right. From an European point of view, US cowboy capitalism is a serious threat to the welfare of our planet!
I highly recommend this book, and I will keep on seeding for some time! "
,stanlie6,2010-05-06T17:43Z,nice book but several pages are missing
,z-man64,2010-05-11T01:07Z,"I got a good one: What do the Goldman Sachs fraud case, the BP oil blowout and the stock market going berserk have in common? They each demonstrate why the private profit motive cannot be relied upon without some steering or harnessing mechanism by government. Hahaha. Funny, huh? And you call THESE people socialists? "
,frostyfreeze,2010-08-30T07:48Z,"maybe i'm missing something here... if people are so enamored of capitalism, why are they on here ""sharing files"" !? ;-)"
,frostyfreeze,2010-08-30T07:51Z,"maybe i'm missing something here... if people are so enamored of capitalism, why are they on here ""sharing files"" !? ;-)

lmao @stanlie6 ""several 'pages' are missing"" !?"
,ambyBAMB33,2011-05-02T00:26Z,"it's not missing pages, the reader is just skipping paragraphs here and there...."

Criticism
In the London Review of Books, Stephen Holmes criticizes The Shock Doctrine as naïve, and opines that it conflates ""'free market orthodoxy' with predatory corporate behaviour.""[14] John Willman of Financial Times describes it as ""a deeply flawed work that blends together disparate phenomena to create a beguiling – but ultimately dishonest– argument.""[15] Tom Redburn in the New York Times states that ""what she is most blind to is the necessary role of entrepreneurial capitalism in overcoming the inherent tendency of any established social system to lapse into stagnation"".[16] Jonathan Chait wrote in The New Republic that Klein ""pays shockingly (but, given her premises, unsurprisingly) little attention to right-wing ideas. She recognizes that neoconservatism sits at the heart of the Iraq war project, but she does not seem to know what neoconservatism is; and she makes no effort to find out.""[17] Robert Cole from The Times said, ""Klein derides the 'disaster capitalism complex' and the profits and privatisations that go with it but she does not supply a cogently argued critique of free market principles, and without this The Shock Doctrine descends into a muddle of stories that are often worrying, sometimes interesting, and occasionally bizarre.""[18] Economist Tyler Cowen, who called Klein's rhetoric ""ridiculous"" and the book a ""true economics disaster"", says that the book contains ""a series of fabricated claims, such as the suggestion that Margaret Thatcher created the Falkland Islands crisis to crush the unions and foist unfettered capitalism upon an unwilling British public.""[19] Fred Kaplan said that Naomi Klein's depiction of the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis as a ""clash between Chicago-style capitalists and honorable, fledgling democrats"" is ludicrous.[20] Johan Norberg of the Cato Institute criticizes the book, saying that ""Klein's analysis is hopelessly flawed at virtually every level"". Norberg finds fault with specifics of the analysis, such as of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, which he says did not crush opposition to pro-market reforms, but in fact caused liberalization to stall for years.[21] Klein responded on her website to both Norberg and Chait, stating both had misrepresented her positions. Klein wrote that Norberg had erected a straw man by claiming that her book is about one man, Friedman, but that it is in fact about a ""multifaceted ideological trend"".[22] Norberg again responded that Klein ""actually defends only one of her central claims that I criticized. Instead she gives the impression that I have just tried to find small mistakes here and there in her book.""[23]"
