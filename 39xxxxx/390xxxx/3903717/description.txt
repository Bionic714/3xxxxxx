	Good morning, Arthur Dent.

	This is a speceal dedication of me aka. lightrusH. Me is Nicolay D.
	These are my first for-public tracks - thus the title "Step One".
	You will hear lost of different sounds inside. You will find variations of
	simple old-school elementary eurodance, chillout, progressive and dark
	psychedelic trance. One is for sure - you have never heard it before.
	How u will like is another story. I hope u will have at least as much 
	fun listening as I had creating the music.
	
	The tracks are licensed under the GPLv2 License so u can download, copy,
	burn with confidence. 

	Keep copying because art has never come from copyright laws.
