But respect to those who actually live up to pirate code."
,FinnishFlash,2007-11-25T22:36Z,IÂ´ll seed this to ratio 10 as usual. Long live pirates!

,Vandal_Savage,2009-01-02T13:52Z,"erm... First off thanks for the torrent  (will seed for as long, and as often, as possible) although I have not quite downloaded the whole thing yet, I looked at the listings and have not found 'The Dead Man' story line. Have you got this please? has anybody got this please?"
,shh636,2009-01-09T02:24Z,"Looks like a great torrent, ty, will seed as long as possible:)"
,zbiggie,2009-10-29T08:08Z,i'll seed until my next computer format. Hopefully I can clear the virus from the system reg or I may have to format soon
