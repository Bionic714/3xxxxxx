,RDCMrT,2007-11-20T10:35Z,"Sorry dude but this upload SUCKS and i will tell you why.

The freaking download is at 35 % for all users, that means i will have the 35 % very soon, but then i will have to wait twice as long untill i have the full 100 % because there is only one person who is seeding, that sucks dude.
Look at the downloads of RELOADED, FLT, ENZ they have multiple 100 % ready seeders. 

(by the way downloading NFSPS is totally fuck to download because the download of RELOADED didn't get higher then 25 kb/s on my pc)

[V],Subzero!,2007-11-21T04:01Z,"if you  peeps would increase the upload speed instead complaining , we all could play the game before xmas... ;)"
,atom224,2007-11-21T04:43Z,"the reviews are mixed on the game sites.  Probably best for fans of the series or racing fanatics.  But one thing is for sure,  someone did a great job with this rip & I appreciate it.  "
,Gabi99yxw,2007-11-22T13:24Z,"Thanks for your great rips , although this is the worst game from nfs series , great to see you are still around , dopeman said he ain't going to rip and upload anymore , hoping that you're going to stay with us you and him are the best rippers ! thanx"

,stilbuzzing,2007-12-13T03:27Z,"Hey ToeD you and the dopeman have saved me so much money it's unbelieveable, i used to buy the games i wanted as soon as they where released, but you 2 deserve a medal each. Since i started DL'ing off the piratebay i've saved over ÂŁ600 which means i can buy myself a new graphics card for christmas and can play Crysis without my PC having an Asthma attack.lol...... Keep up the brilliant work you guys and your teams do. Ya get a standing ovation from me!!!!!!!!"
,Squba17,2007-12-13T04:35Z,seeding helps everyone....including YOU so please seed it wont slow ur downloads down.... 
[V],Subzero!,2007-12-13T20:10Z,"remember ... 
you all should remove the 2 trackers, only the pirate bay one should be there!...
this can be done easy when you use utorrent  by double click on the torrent in the utorrent screen!...
this should increase download speed as well..."

,eivind09,2007-12-22T16:53Z,how do I instal the game?
,Bluepowder,2007-12-24T01:07Z,SEED please :)
[V],Subzero!,2007-12-24T06:27Z,"@eivind09
i know people who might had a look on the description... or other files included in this torrent..."
[V],Subzero!,2007-12-31T18:51Z,"this is the reloaded version, no difference... you may tell us the exact error which appeared, otherwise go here and test if your system can handle the game
http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/referrer/srtest"
[V],Subzero!,2008-01-05T23:23Z,"no prob, well normally you can exit the prostreet.exe directly, and then answer YES for the reg entries, if this doesnt appears for any reason you can manually start the ToeD.reg file by double clicking on it!. after you did this, you can start the game with nfs.exe and if you wanna update the game soon (patch) you use the originalnfs.exe (rename to nfs.exe then update). well hope i could help you in any way!.
or right click on the nfs.exe and change compatible mode ;)... dunno just an idea!"
,DOTOCM1,2008-01-17T16:23Z,"the system specs for this game are wrong it say minimum cpu p4 2.8ghz

Can you explain all the suspicious code in the keygen? Why does a ToeD keygen need to access and write to important system folders?(I'm not talking about libraryiess installed, but the windows core)
