  is back with

...:: Need for Speed ProStreet -.direct.play.- ::...



:.ripped ...> not even 1 byte... (nothing)





.: install :.

1.: Unrar with latest winrar (3.62 or higher) or use 7zip!.

2.: double click: ProStreet.exe ( must be done )

3.: launch game with nfs.exe




S p e c i a l   I n f o   N o t e :

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of a packed exe 

( ProStreet.exe )

as a lame virus, (coz its the byte by byte check error of em!.) 

Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics

you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!.

(heuristics).    >>>  thank you for reading!.
