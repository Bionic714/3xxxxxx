Codebreaker Version 9.3 Patched

This version of codebreaker will NOT boot de CD/DVD in your tray after choosing the cheats, instead, it will boot any file/program/elf called "CB_launch.elf" or "BOOT.ELF" in these locations, in this order:

hdd0:/__boot/CB_launch.elf
mass:/BOOT/CB_launch.elf
mc0:/BOOT/CB_launch.elf
hdd0:/__boot/boot.elf
mass:/BOOT/BOOT.ELF
mc0:/BOOT/BOOT.ELF
mc0:/B?DATA-SYSTEM/BOOT.ELF
mc1:/BOOT/BOOT.ELF
mc1:/B?DATA-SYSTEM/BOOT.ELF
"?" means region code.

This hack is made so u can load HDLoader instead of a CD/DVD based game so u can use cheats with the games u have on your HDD!

So, boot this program from MC, MASS, HDD or CD, CodeBreaker will start, choose your cheats, then 'start game' and HDLoader will start.

after that, just choose the game u have loaded the cheats for and play :)

I have included both the patched codebreaker 9.3 and HDLoader version 8b.

So this COdebreaker is only for ppl with HDD and HDloader!

Normally u have to load cheats, then put in the HDLoader CD and then 'start game'

after that HDLoader will start and u can start your game from HDD with cheats.

with this patched codebreaker 9.3 u dont have to use HDLoader from cd, but u can just sit back and relax while HDLoader boots from any of the above paths.

just make sure u RENAME your HDLoader.elf file to CB_launch.elf or BOOT.ELF and place it in one of the above paths! 

Have fun!

any questions?
