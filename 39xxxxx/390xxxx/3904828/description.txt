Shivers - PC Game - 1995

Shivers is set in Professor Windlenot's Museum of the Strange and Unusual, an abandoned collection of strange artifacts from around the world. It seems you've been dared to spend the night in the dilapidated old museum, which was never open to the public due to a bizarre incident that took place many years ago. Two teenagers and the professor himself disappeared under unknown circumstances, and you must solve the mystery if you're to survive until dawn.
