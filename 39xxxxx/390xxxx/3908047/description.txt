One of the strangest films ever made. THUNDERCRACK! starts out as a horror flick with some people taking refuge in a ghostly mansion during a storm at the countryside. Their hostess is one of the weirdest female characters ever shown on screen. Dead drunk, horny, delirious: Marion Eaton plays the role with a vengeance. What is the secret with her dead husband? Where is her son? Why does she keep human body parts in the cellar? It really doesn?t matter much. Very soon, everyone gets involved in something much more interesting: having sex in every which way possible and impossible. Curt McDowell's THUNDERCRACK! is a true cult classic which has shocked, excited and amazed audiences during the last 28 years.
