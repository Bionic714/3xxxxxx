By the time Dog In The Sand was released, most Pixies fans had given up on Frank Black ever releasing an album that was worthy of merely standing in the shadows of his previous bands worst releases. It was totally unexpected then that Dog In The Sand was home to some of the best material that Frank Black / Black Francis / Charles Thompson had written since Doolittle, indeed some of the songs here are better than material on the last two pixies albums. Chief among these is "Blast Off", a song which seems to pay tribute in equal parts to David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. In addition to this epic first track, "Robert Onion", "Bullet" and "Hermaphroditos" are as strong as anything on Bossanova or Trompe le monde.
