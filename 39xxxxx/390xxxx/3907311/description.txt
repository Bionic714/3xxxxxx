-=Product Description=-

Together nearly a decade, Lonestar's success and growth have been consistent and prevalent throughout the years, as the band continues to challenge itself.  Musically noted for captivating taken-for-granted moments of everyday life; and slamming them with such vocal and instrumental power that the result is transformed from the everyday to classic. Classics that target the heart such as, "Amazed," "My Front Porch Looking In" (the most-played country song of 2003) and "I'm Already There," a special favorite of the military and their families and BMI/ASCAP Song Of The Year for 2002.

The brand new Christmas CD from Lonestar entitled My Christmas 
List also features their new lead vocalist Cody Collins. Sold  
through Cracker Barrel ┬«, this CD features 11 tracks of holiday
standards and a couple new songs just to keep things           
interesting. Cody seems to fit well into the mix with this band
of seasoned professionals. This is a fun CD that will fit in   
well in any holiday gathering.                                 
                                                               
When Lonestar's last studio album Mountains only sold 89       
thousand copies, the band felt that it was time to make some   
changes for the sake of the group and everyone involved. So    
when Richie McDonald and the group parted company, they found  
themselves without a lead vocalist. This is not a good position
for a band to be in after establishing a rather large catalogue
of fan favorites. So, Lonestar regrouped figuratively and      
literally, and brought in the guy who would become the band's  
new lead vocalist, Cody Collins.                               
So, who is Cody Collins? He was born in Dothan, Alabama and    
grew up in the small town of Pace, Florida outside of          
Pensacola. He began his musical journey very early on in life. 
Cody was very active in sports throughout his childhood years. 
And more than likely if you saw Cody, you also saw his guitar  
because he always had it in hand. Cody Collins attended college
in Pensacola where he majored in music. But he decided to take 
a break so he could take a gig at a popular country music night
club in Atlanta called Cowboys. Collins joined Lonestar as they
entered into a new chapter of the group's career when Richie   
McDonald announced his departure from the group. After Michael 
Britt and Keech Rainwater got a glimpse of Collins, and after a
Nashville audition with the band, Lonestar needed no further   
convincing that he would be the new frontman for the group.
