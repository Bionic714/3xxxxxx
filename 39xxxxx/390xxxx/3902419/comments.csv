[T],supaturtle,2007-11-27T22:21Z,"OMG, always the same. here's some pirate out there in www, who offers you a big load of 14 giga. all you can do is screaming and crying: more speed !!. well, if you don't have the patience to wait, why don't buy this stuff ?? "
[T],supaturtle,2007-11-27T22:43Z,"@palmofsweden and @SKY-0602: who gives you the right to crying for more speed, can't see that you ever offer a file here on tpb, damn leechers ;). @palmofsweden: i've noticed that you joined WingZ too, i'll keep my eyes on you, buddy."
,palmofsweden,2007-11-28T11:12Z,"Ive been their for quite a while and Im happy to leech everywhere! I also should mention that I'm ALWAYS seeding a 1to1 ratio here on tpb. I think WOS is really bad, it would be good if they had hosted their files on their own server. And that the damn so called ""Boss"" would be a nice guy, but he really isn't. I depend on TPB for everything Music, Movies, Games and I´m very thankful to that. Also I like to take things not too seriously. I don't cry for more speed here, but it looks like no one is getting forward on this one. My question was simply if he had stop seeding, and therefore making it pointless too leech these files. Im gonna qoute ""All you need is love"". Also aren't you an active member at WOS too Supaturtle?"
,palmofsweden,2007-11-28T11:14Z,I have been on TPB much longer than Wings of Silence.
