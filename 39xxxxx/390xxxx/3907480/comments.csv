You should have the ability to convert these (it is easy to convert WMA files using iTunes in Windows). Also, please use rar formats for the larger files (such as the Schuman lieder). Other than that, thanks for uploading these. I have many of these on vinyl and--at this point--no way to convert to MP3 or MP4."
[T],Dark_Swordsman,2007-12-08T20:01Z,"thanx for the tip. I use Nero To Convert all file formats. I have the required Nero plug ins to do so and they are available on here for download for those who have Nreo. I have a software that will split the APE files..it took me a while to find it. A File someone had up there called...Some Free Programs. inside i got something called CUE splitter. the guy who uploaded that...i want to shake his hane. I had something called APE ripper, but it only allows you to use it 3 times because its a trial and no serial out there. So the Cue spltter solved my problem with the APE files. I will repost some of these in MP3 and i got a new external drive and i already been changing my vinyl ripps to mp3 to consolidate and shrink and volume level them. new postings will be on soon , so look for them."
