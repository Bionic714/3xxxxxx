I'll ban you from downloading from me with my client. 
so please help me get these torrents going so everyone can download at a decent speed and get the full file. also so i can up the other EPS. "
,carolinawolf,2007-11-25T06:50Z,"help me out guys,
first to get a full copy,hit and ran."
,carolinawolf,2007-11-25T10:57Z,"thanks looks as if i have some people now that care about helping others rather than just themselves.
thanks for seeding."
,carolinawolf,2007-11-25T18:54Z,Will post Lonesome Dove The Original.  in 4 parts if i ever get these up and seeded.
,carolinawolf,2007-11-25T21:06Z,"ALL 4 ARE UP.
Hang  on I'm trying to seed all 4 eps so it may be slow going until we get a few seeds up.
no fear i will keep it going.
if you can please jump on and help seed some of the others if you have them.

I have Lonesome Dove The Original in 4 eps. i plan to seed when these are well seeded."

,carolinawolf,2007-11-26T16:03Z,"disregard the link above. i have found numerous new people just now starting to download all the torrents at once. there is not enough bandwidth to seed all the torrents at one time.
i have seeded over 20 gigs because of hit and runs. now these new people are downloading all at one time and downloading 4 gigs and seeding back only a trickle.
after most have finished they just leave with out seeding back.
each time this is done someone has to seed another 4 gigs to fill in what they have stolen.
i will repost Lonesome Dove after the ""Lonesome Dove the Original"" has 3 seeds.
if you haven't started it please don't it will be reposted at a later time as Lonesome Dove . i will only put up one every three days because of the ones that jump on all at once and then hit and run.
when they are posted you will have three days to get them, after that i will not reseed."
