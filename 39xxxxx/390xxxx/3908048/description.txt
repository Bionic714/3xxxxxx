This is the third in a series of four.
I have all four and will post as soon as I have a seeder to keep this going.
I will post four next and then go to 1 and 2.
I'm doing it this way because the DVD-R only shows EPS. 1 and 2. and leaves you hanging wondering what happened next.

I'm starting this way so those caught like me will be looking for these 3 and 4 next.

hope i have enough interest in these to post 1 and two also let me know if you want them seeded
