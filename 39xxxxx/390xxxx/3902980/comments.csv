,Mournfel,2007-11-25T05:33Z,"i just figured that you would know that with out a good version of the game with a cd key off a legally obtained version you're not gonna get online play. seriously though if anyone of you find pirated games with online play post them here or send a link to my email mournfel@gmail.com, because i have never found one that actually works."
