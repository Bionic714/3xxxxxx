The Late Great Planet Earth (1979)

Film based on the book by Hal Lindsey.  Like many others in this genre Lindsey predicted the coming of doomsday by the year 2000 by reinterpreting the Book of Revelation.  His predictions have proven to be both wrong and quixotic, but the film is very well made.  Orson Welles' narration adds a particularly compelling touch.
