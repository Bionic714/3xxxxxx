This AVI file has audio/video synchronization error (mouth doesn't match speech). A/V delay adjustment during play doesn't fix it! The problem can be fixed by converting it to a MKV file:

mplayer -dumpaudio ""The Late Great Planet Earth.avi"" -dumpfile audio.ac3
mkvmerge -o TLGPE.mkv -A ""The Late Great Planet Earth.avi"" audio.ac3

The mkv plays perfect!

Video quality is nice. Audio quality is ok for vocal/narration (most of movie), but during moments of dramatic music the 64kbps audio rate can't reproduce the music well.

Video: DivX 720x480 24bpp 29.97fps 1199.5kbps
Audio: AC3 2.0 (stereo) 48kHz 64kbps
Runtime: 1:30:57

Nice old movie. Worth the download. :)"
