Farewell show from the remaining members of Windir, my favorite band, recorded live at Rockefeller in Oslo the 3rd September 2004. The vocals are handled mostly by Windir rhythm guitarist Sture, and some vocals by Valfar`s big brother Vegard. If only Valfar could have been on vocals...but still, Sture and Vegard did a fine job.

DVD rip, very good quality. For all Windir fans, a must have.
