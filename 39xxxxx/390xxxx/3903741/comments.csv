I notice the 128MB req, but sometimes it will work on slower cards as well."
,fp04,2007-11-24T12:38Z,@friendly: it says in the desription that i doesn't support the GMA950
,jakecool,2007-11-24T14:00Z,fantastic! it works like a charm...absolutely wonderful. Graphics:perfect. 
,jakecool,2007-11-24T14:55Z,"CHEATS: to unlock all cars,tracks... 



go to /library/preferences/codemasters/colin mc rae rally mac/   
copy and backup the option file to desktop or whatever you like.
then, open the ""options"" file with an hex editor.  The first line should look like this:

08 00 00 00 64 64 64 02 00 00 00 00 FF 00 00 00 FF 00 00 00 22 22 22 22  .

Save the file. Exit. Run the game...Enjoy.

If it doesn't work for you, i'll upload the option file.

,matte1979,2007-11-27T19:11Z,Seeda!!!!! stuco on 20%.... =)
,victorserge,2007-11-29T05:55Z,"Best. Up. Ever. This is the _only_ crack I've ever seen that's just one file, one unzip and you're in. No disc image mounting, no serial #s... double click and that's it. Papa Smurf, I salute you, this is an excellent job!"
,Immortal7,2007-12-01T17:04Z,"wow, very nice.  worth the wait."
,cosmo928,2007-12-01T21:08Z,"Wonder why, but it's not working for me; game freezes up. The furthest I got was at the name selection screen.

Any suggestions? "
,Immortal7,2007-12-04T00:54Z,"Is there a way to edit the game with hexedit so it doesn't say ""Sorry, your computer has to low graphics""?"
,kjell123agd,2007-12-04T02:09Z,"Interesting, cosmo928 wrote that the screen freezes up. I can play any time trial, or start to select options for a Career, but at any time when the word ""Continue"" appears on the screen at any part of the game, my computer completely freezes - the only way out is to turn it off."
,mariusl,2007-12-10T15:53Z,"it does work perfectly !!
go online with gamerangers ;)"
,Wedas,2007-12-20T11:01Z,Works great on MBP C2D 2.33GHz (17'')! Thank you!

,Sumerah,2008-01-06T17:08Z,"Jakecool: could you please upload the OPTION file, or post more clear instructions?

My first line looks like
00 00 00 00 64 64 64 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

,maaseja,2008-02-09T13:08Z,"I triad too download this but its going to take me 46 days! Only 3 seeds! What's the point of TPB and the philosophy of sharing files if people don't seed? Don't be so f****g selfish!!!

,drcrunkenstein,2008-10-14T02:48Z,... you can go into the menus and turn on all the cars and courses. god damn i wonder how you people even zip up your own pants.
,djblastyfone,2008-10-28T00:51Z,"This is God. He commands you to seed. He does not want to stay stuck at 98.36% for another 4 hours. No, seriously guys. Uncap your upload speeds and do those 129 current leechers a favor."
,9qwer1,2008-11-01T05:19Z,"he changed it
its not real... its a vid of rick roll"
,trip221,2008-11-14T15:42Z,"Works great on my macbook SR 2.2 with the integrated X3100 graphics.  Now just need to get a gamepad, driving with the keyboard sucks.

Took a while to get, so I'll be seeding this for a while. "
,theanimaster,2008-11-16T08:38Z,"what the fuck? I have the original game DVD and it does NOT play well at all on my 2.4hz white macbook with the x3100 graphics -- yet there are people here that claim it works for them. Could it be that Feral is intentionally fucking it up for the integrated graphics lot?? And somehow, this cracked version is allowing integrated graphics machines to run the game nicely?? Well fuck -- this's what I get for buying the original!!"
,Paravan,2008-11-17T22:12Z,Thanks a lot

,theanimaster,2010-03-19T17:21Z,Errr... someone mentioned a crack for unlocking all cars and tracks. No need -- you can do it in the game... just go to the SECRETS menu. No need to fiddle with hex editors. 
,eltaho,2010-04-13T06:35Z,Please seed!  I'm downloading this game since last week. 15-20kb/s so slow!
