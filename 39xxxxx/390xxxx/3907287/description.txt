                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This week, we look at fascinating, complex China through the eyes of the 
always outspoken and penetrating writer, Jan Wong, whose life has been 
intertwined with that country's history since the 1970's. She talks about 
her search there for a woman she denounced thirty years ago when she was 
a Maoist and her discovery of a new China that is rich, powerful, and 
increasingly ambitious about its global role.

Although China is still a one party state, you'd be forgiven if you traveled 
there and didn't realize it had ever been run by the Communists.Cities like 
Beijing and Shanghai, in particular, now seem like monuments to 
entrepreneurialism and capitalism.The 2008 Olympics in Beijing next year, is 
often described as China's giant "coming out party", a celebration of its 
booming economy, and its transformation into a modern world power. the 
government there is being very careful that nothing spoil the party. So it 
hasn't enjoyed international media coverage of the recent scandals over toxic 
Chinese exports, like toys, toothpaste and food... about alarming pollution 
in big cities and the criticism over human rights abuses inside the country, 
as well as the propping up of corrupt governments like Sudan, which is 
supporting genocide in Darfur.

Jan Wong knows the good and bad of China. She has lived there through some 
of the toughest times, the Cultural Revolution, the Tiananmen massacre of 1989, 
and she's also seen the joyous leap in the 1990's of so many Chinese people 
toward perhaps the highest living standards in their history. She has recorded 
this transition in numerous best selling books, always vivid  in their 
analysis, but also funny and with a nuanced understanding of Chinese society 
as it really is.

Brian was glad to sit down with her recently and hear about her latest 
journey to China last summer and the book she produced. Her quest this time 
was to find a woman she had gone to school with in Beijing in the 1970's and 
whom Wong had, in her youthful ideological fervour, denounced to school 
authorities because the girl just wanted to see the United States.Jan Wong 
went back thirty years later to find out what happened to her and see if she 
too has shared in the Chinese economic miracle...
