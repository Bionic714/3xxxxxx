i think it chages depending on what coutry you are in"
,LunarHigh,2008-08-14T00:11Z,"Quit arguing over which season/DVD set this is and just seed it, enjoy it, and shut the hell up. There's a list of what episodes this includes so if you already have it then don't download it dumbfucks, and if you have a couple episodes already but not a majority then just DL anyway and delete the ones you already have you ass-clowns."

,senser86,2009-01-14T13:22Z,"there is a bit of the screen missing , you can see it when text is shown...how come?"
,ninzo,2009-02-02T23:28Z,"quit with the bullshit fighting, if you have these episodes, then fuck off, if not then download, simple as that."
,cleaveland,2009-06-02T11:26Z,Just look at the episode names you douchebags. Who fucking cares what season they may or may not have called it. 
,Curare01,2010-01-08T00:04Z,This is season 4.
,dustfungo,2010-01-16T04:54Z,This is Season 5.  These episodes appear on the last Volume 4 DVD of Futurama. The DVD sets aren't based on seasons as every season had a completely different number of episodes.
,dustfungo,2010-01-16T04:56Z,"Btw, Wikipedia is wrong again. They're even calling the movies as season 5.  Figure that out."

,lokiiztwiztid,2011-02-02T10:05Z,just to clear the air there was 5 seasons on fox for a toatl of 87 episodes then season 6 on CC which had 13 episodes for a total of 100 episodes the movies had nothing to do with the seasons due to they were created after the cancellation from fox and before CC picked it up so whos dumb now
,Boganhouse,2011-05-13T06:40Z,i just downloaded season 6 lol ima see how this goes
,Boganhouse,2011-05-13T06:44Z,"Lunarhigh

True i can just also deselect the ones u dont want .. or just download em all cuz futurama is good, its only 2.7gb not much if u got high Bandwith, mines only 200gb but ill download alot of movies :)"
,Thetruesong,2011-07-02T05:09Z,"Ok everyone needs to get their shit together, is this season 4 or 5?"
,crazycrab,2012-04-08T20:55Z,"I'm going to try to explain, the number of seasons and in some cases the episode order in the original FOX broadcast and in the DVD release is different.  Most notably that the first 72 episodes were broadcast over 5 seasons with the DVD release of these episodes over 4.  So this is NOT wrong."
,dasjacobfilms,2012-07-26T10:12Z,This is season four but Khif was adjusting in order of air date.
