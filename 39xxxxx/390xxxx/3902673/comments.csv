Whats the story guys?"

Just too impatient I guess - working a treat!!!!!!!!!!"
,redcore,2007-12-01T01:14Z,"It's a good CD - but it's a very average ""vanilla"" release that we see from so many new, young (and sometimes groomed) artists. There are some cool songs...but this is a very ""safe"" album, and it feels kinda ""kiddy"" high school with the puppy love songs. As far as her singing, she's obviously a great singer but only a few songs really showcase how powerful her voice is. 

This is a good CD at the end of the day, though."
