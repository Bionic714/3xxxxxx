There was some good dvd versions of this movie 
(like innsyn version 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3870534/Pirates.Of.The.Caribbean.At.Worlds.End.2007.PAL.DVDR-iNNSYN)
and lot of shit versions

I did not like this movies slow menus and animation after every button. I hevily edited this version. I removed several VTS and PGC's. Then I manually edited PGC commands and button commands. Why to go to language menu if the is nothing to select. Now menus go straightly to subtitle menu and back to main menu. Menus are now very fast. I hate slow menus.
When you make big changes to the structure, it's quite difficult to edit pgc commands.
One good point is that when you totally remove everything unnessecary you have more room for video.
Avarage bitrate is highest I found and I think there is no way to get it higher. 

Now you have one more choice to select.
(I made also part 2 and working with first one. All three movies same quality. If somebody likes this version mayby I release them)
