,vaino666,2007-11-21T09:29Z,"I can make easily ISO or NRG. But power Dvd can play VIDEO_ TS folder. Media player classic too. For me it's easier burn and play from folder. When you are working with movie, it have to be in a folder and it's easier to check different VOBs etc. You dont have to use severals virtual dvds. I work same time with many movies.
Of course I can relese next one ISO format."

,vaino666,2007-11-24T13:23Z,"The first part is under construction. If there is something i can do different way, I would like to hear. I want to make best releases that there is nothing to change and no mistakes, no way to make it better ( until I get newer version of CinemaCraft)
Please tell me your suggestions"

,BasicKiller,2007-12-06T14:15Z,"Vaino666
thanks for the upload, i have a question. Why u (and most uploaders) prefer DD instead of DTS?
I think DTS sounds better.... Thanks again"
,vaino666,2007-12-08T09:21Z,"Of course DTS sound is better and I want to keep it but...
-DTS sound is example 768 kbps and DD5.1 448 kbps, so DTS takes nearly two times space than DD. And it's all gone from picture.
Older stand alone players can't play DTS, like mine and if there is DTS there have to be DD sound too that everybody can watch it.
If you have both audio tracks and the movies runtime is long, avarage bitrate for picture can drop below 3000 kbps. In that case the quality of picture is getting worse rapidly.
This movie: Avarage bitrate is now 3235 and it's low. Runtime is nearly 3 hours and with DTS it would be ideal for blind people."
