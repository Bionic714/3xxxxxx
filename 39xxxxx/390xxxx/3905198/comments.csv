,BrotherNumsi,2007-11-23T19:25Z,hmm foreign compared to? :)
,DogNo7,2007-11-25T01:45Z,"Foreign, compared to Jolly old England or America, where most Brits or Americans tend to think of everything outside their borders as Foreign.  The truth be known, we even think of the Scotts and Irish as foreign [just kidding: in incredibly bad taste, I know, but not too far from the truth.  The Welsh, we are still trying to decide about, but the Norwegians, Swedish, and Finn's are clearly way out, and quite obviously foreign.]"
