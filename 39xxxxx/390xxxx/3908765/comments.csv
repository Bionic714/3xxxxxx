[V],SciFi-Sumo,2007-12-21T20:47Z,Hello ZLO. I hear that Eurosport channel will stop showing sumo this jan-2008. Are you in Japan or Europe? How are all us fans of yours and Sumo looking for Jan '08? Thanks so much for all you do ZLO!
,Herlock,2007-12-22T01:27Z,"I'm joining to SciFi-Sumo.

Eurosport channel will stop showing sumo.... :(

zlo666, will you planning to upload January basho here?"
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2007-12-27T14:43Z,"As of right now, Dec 27, we are 16 Days, 09 Hours, 48 Mins from the Hatsu Basho. Can we hope your DVR will be working ZLO? Thanks for all you do!"
,joem35,2007-12-30T06:24Z,"I just found out that the Comcast in my area (Maryland, USA) will be getting TV Japan (NHK World Premium) as a premium channel ($25) 
in the next month or two. It's currently an ""On Demand"" premium in one Maryland County.  Folks with Comcast might want to check and see if they will also be getting this premium channel option. I'll keep folks posted, but it won't happen in time for the January basho. So zlo666, we're still counting on you bro. But fear not, if I can get NHK Sumo, I can try and copy and upload the days if you want a break.
Joe"
