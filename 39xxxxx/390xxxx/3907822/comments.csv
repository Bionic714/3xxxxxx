,gigantliest,2008-05-26T15:31Z,"Track 14 on CD 1 wouldn't play on or transfer into iTunes. I'm downloading it again in case it was an error. I also noticed that there is a question mark in the file name. This time I will try removing that and let you know if this works.

Thanks very much :-)"
,gigantliest,2008-05-26T15:40Z,"nope. Tried downloading again and same problem, plus the file when downloaded doesn't have a question mark though it is listed as having one on this site.

Not sure what to do. :-("
