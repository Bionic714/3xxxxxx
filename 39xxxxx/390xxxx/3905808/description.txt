Lady Dragon (Cynthia Rothrock, 1992) - Rmvb

Amazon.com
After her new husband receives a fatal shower of .45 caliber rice, a vengeance-seeking widow must learn an ancient fighting technique in order to bring down the bad guys in this amusing bone-cruncher of a film. Five-time world kickboxing champion Cynthia Rothrock may be somewhat inexpressive in the lead role, but whatever she lacks in charisma is more than made up for by her sheer kick-ass athleticism--a trait director-cinematographer David Worth captures admirably. (In true exploitation-fu fashion, every impressive kick or punch is shown a minimum of three times at differing speeds.) Former 1970s action presence Robert Ginty (forever known to Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans as "That Paper Chase Guy") lends an authoritatively stoic hand as a shady ally. Rothrock's final coup de grace to beefcake baddie Richard Norton is guaranteed to inspire a collective sympathetic wince from male viewers. This full-frame DVD includes production notes, cast/crew bios, and the marvelously histrionic original trailer. --Andrew Wright
