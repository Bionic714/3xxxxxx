This CD-ROM is designed to be an interactive guide to the music and lyrics of Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks circa 1966/67 and for the finished version of SMiLE presented in 2004.

This is NOT an Audio CD. It is an interactive CD that addresses SMiLE as a subject of study -- a historical perspective on the music, its creator and its time. Supported by facts, dates, biographical information and speculative writing, it is THE tool for exploring SMiLE -- what it was, what it might have been and what it became!

It is not just a collection of MP3s. It is also a comprehensive timeline of the original Dumb Angel/SMiLE project and can be used as a data source for further research and interpretations.

It also contains observations and writings about how the world received SMiLE in 2004.

BITTORRENT
The ProjectSMiLE version 2.1 CD-ROM is distributed by the means of BitTorrent. This short description will guide you through the
steps of getting the disc via bittorrent. If you want to know just enough to get 
the disc move on to "What do I need to do?". If you want to get all the details
about BitTorrent here are a couple of links to follow:

WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?
If you just want to know enough to get the disc, here are a few steps to follow:
- download a bittorrent program and install on your PC. A couple of such programs are:
	- "burst!" can be downloaded at:   http://krypt.dyndns.org:81/torrent/index.phtml?action=download
	- "BitTornado" can be downloaded at:  http://www.bittornado.com/download.html
	- "Azureus" can be downloaded at:  http://azureus.sourceforge.net/
- download the torrent file for the ProjectSMiLE disc (found in the Files section here in the group)
- start the bittorrent program
- open the bittorrent file from within the program
- specify a folder into which to download the image file for ProjectSMiLE 2.1
- start the download

If you run into trouble, check out the "troubleshooting" pages at the site from
where you downloaded the program (see above).

If all else fails, post a message here on the board and hopefully someone else
among the members are using the same program as you and can be of assistance.

SO, I DOWNLOADED THE FILE, THEN WHAT?
When you have dowbloaded the file (yes, it's only one file to download, although
it is large...), then you open up your disc burning program. There should be an
option in there called something like "Burn image". Choose that option and
select the file you just downloaded. Start the burn!

For you pros out there, take a look at "Mount ISO image"
