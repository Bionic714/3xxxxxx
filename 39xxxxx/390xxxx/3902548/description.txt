-----------------------
Hey you? Yeah we mean you, Mr big I-Own-A-CD-ROM head. Think you're pretty smart don't you? Think you know your trivia, don't you? Well think again.

YOU DON'T KNOW JACK is the award winning, irreverent, fast-paced game show that has taken the US by storm, and now the UK has the chance to get its fingers on the buzzers. It's got excitement, suprises, manic humour, feverish activity and more hidden features than a masked ball. Get ready - we're going to suck trivia from your brain with a big straw.

YOU DON'T KNOW JACK can be played by one to three players. The goal of YOU DON'T KNOW JACK is to rack up the cash. Get the most cash and you win. It's that simple, except, it isn't.
