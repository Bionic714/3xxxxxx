http://shop.tetongravity.com/Products/Lost-And-Found-DVD__TG225DVD.aspx

There is VERY little profit margin in the ski industry and every purchase helps ensure that companies like TGR can continue to make quality films like this in the future.

I'm big into the torrent scene and download and seed TONS of tv shows and movies, BUT downloading free shows from a GIANT corporation is one thing....stealing from an independent ski film company is completely different.  Support both the torrent scene and the skiing scene and purchase this film."

,snowrider22,2007-11-29T01:21Z,"thanks man this is sick...

,LychaN,2008-08-18T04:40Z,"tordnordell i couldnt agree more. sometimes i think 
it would be easier to iceskate the slope than ski it here in sweden.
