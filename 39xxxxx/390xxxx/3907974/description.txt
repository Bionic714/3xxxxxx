- 512mb of ram (min)
- Pentium 4+ Processor (min)

Release Notes:
Information:
"Unlike previous releases and update formats, we've decided to give it our one last stand and try to bring the most stable release for the public once again. The developer team did not feel that MGTPack 1.0 was a hit, and as such, we've gone underground for several weeks, only spilling out very little information, doing rigorous testing and fixing to come to this.

MGTPack 1.2

This post will look much more differently than the traditional update / release post we've had in the past. In order to not confuse any newcomers, we've decided to merge the core, database, and website feature list into one unified changelog. Don't worry, it'll still be in the same order, so you will be able to hint out which is what.

We're glad to present you, and this is coming straight from our testers (a big thanks to them of course, because without them, I don't know in what shape this release would be in), the most stable, working release of MGTPack yet."

So, you must be very eager to hear about the release changelog. Unfortunately, there were some features that were not tested, but had been reported as "working". We'll keep that in the changelog, under a different highlight to inform you about this, but we are not making any promises. Other than that, the dev team is still very glad to present all the fully tested and working features. Again, a big thanks to our testers for making all of this possible.
