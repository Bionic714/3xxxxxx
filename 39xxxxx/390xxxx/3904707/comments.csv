,Derty1,2007-11-23T17:41Z,Are you shure is RC2 ToH????
,ticklemonster,2007-11-23T19:59Z,catalin1082 ur the asshole cause this is probably not toh this is just a patched leopard dvd without a bootloader that u install only if u noe wat ur doing...and by the looks of it u don't know wat ur doing
,catalin1082,2007-11-24T01:14Z,"is ToH all day!
same size...2 assholes now."
,bobtentpeg,2007-11-24T07:08Z,"I wont accuse anyone, but you know catalin that the script for making a SL DVD makes a 4.38gb image.

So without downloading and checking there is no way to know if it the [ToH] release or not.

Give the guy the benefit of the doubt and lets not jump to conclusions"
,DataCentre,2007-11-24T07:26Z,"Quote from original uploader/seeder: 

""I got a request from apple to pull the torrent and close this topic. Of course i dont want to end up in court so... I am now closing the topic and will not seed the torrent.""

So in other words, there are no seeder who have 100% of this OS.  Everyone is stuck at 13.6%.  It will stay that way unless someone who has the whole thing seeds."
,bobtentpeg,2007-11-25T02:16Z,"bullshit, he just didnt want to seed"

""Ok everyone this is the moment you've all been waiting for. As promised, today, November 22, 2007 I have released the Mac OS X x86 ISO. Lets get started, shall we?
Note: you may want to print these instructions to fall along while you are installing Leopard.

Step 1: 
Now the first step is to, of course, download the attatched torrent. I and a couple of other friends will be seeding 24/7. 

Step 2:
Burn it to a DVD-R.

Step 3:
Boot up from the DVD. Please be patient as this takes a while.

Step 4:
Look in awe at the LEOPARD INSTALLER!!!!! Cool, aint it? 
Now, select your language. It'll say ""Preparing Installation...""

Step 5:
Once it says ""WELCOME"" a menubar will appear at the top. Select Utilities -> Disk Utility. Then find your harddrive. Format it to MAC OS X (Journaled). Then make a partition named ""Leopard"" and format it to MAC OS X (Journaled) as well.

Step 6:
Press Start + Q. (This is same as Apple-Q or Command-Q)
This will exit Disk Utility.
Now press Utilities -> Terminal. Type the following:

cd /
cd /usr/misc
./script.sh Leopard

Note this will only work if you made a PARTITION named Leopard. If you followed the instructions exactly thus far, you should be fine.

It'll do a whole bunch of stuff and at the end it should say ""Done.""
That means it is Done. (No kidding, huh?)

Step 7:
INSTALL LEOPARD!! WAHOO!!
Select Next, Select your Hard Drive, Select Customize and Deselect ALL PACKAGES. Then press Next. The installation should take about 15-10 minutes. 

Step 8:
It will restart and when it prompts you to press a key to install Mac OS X, DONT!!! Wait until the counter goes down to 0. It will load Mac OS X!

Step 9:
Do the victory dance!!

Congratulations! You've done it! Enjoy!"""
,Calum44,2008-12-30T04:53Z,"Thank You manny54321

I wouldn't be able to do it without your instructions, cheers big man.

I'm off to download this, if it works i will seed for a lifetimeeeee!"
,nisargbadani,2009-02-11T08:28Z,"When i boot up my disc, only the driers and plugins get installed n there it stops... my burner burns full 4GB but when i saw the property of the disc there was only 480kb used.. only some boot files were there...my 2 dvds got waste because i tried in 2 burners..
any solution to this?? plz help urgent"
,DubMess,2009-03-24T17:06Z,Pleeeeeease Seeeeeeeeeeed!!!!!!
,Archangel7cps,2009-04-08T03:29Z,"Does this work for AMD processors?

And also, SEED!

Please seed!"
,creepymitten,2009-04-08T07:05Z,"The install was flawless.

The only problem I have with the whole situation is that I the wireless networking doesn't work."
,creepymitten,2009-04-08T19:44Z,"I also had a problem with the audio.

I am on a Dell Inspiron E1505

Basically the problems I'm having are with the audio, networking, and OS selection at boot.

It left my Vista and my Windows 7 partitions alone.  They were fine, but I could not boot into them since the boot for this torrent takes priority over that.  Plus, you can't boot this OS X without the burned CD being in the drive.  Once you've installed, the computer will not recognize ANY operating system until you boot with and OS install disc.

Once you put in the the patched CD and restart, the Mac will boot.

They way I regained access to my other partitions was through booting into the the Vista OS setup disc.  Next, I went to repair my boot sequence.  Once I did that, the Mac boot was no where to be seen and it showed the option to boot into my Vista or Windows 7.  After you you repair your boot sequence, there is no way to get back into the OS X one without reinstalling it again.

To wrap it up, there is no way to be able to choose from your Windows OS and this one at boot.  It either one, or the other.

Hope this helps guys.  I'm seeding."
,UWHuskyPD22,2009-04-10T18:43Z,"Guys, I am having a lot of trouble installing this on my Toshiba PC.  I checked out what is needed and I shouldn't be having a problem but when it goes through the install process on the black screen with all the words sometimes it freezes than if I actually do get past that screen my screen on the laptop will get very disorientated and I can't see anything but little Mac os x wording across the screen.  

Anyone that can help me would be awesome. "
,fgery1988,2009-04-16T16:10Z,"Hy!
I have a little bit problem! I'm understand all of this but when i'm would like to choose the partition where i'd like to put the Leopard there is nothing, just the DVD Drive and the ToH disc. Nothying else.
Plese help me because i'd really like to get leopard on my laptop.
Thanks!!!"
,noworkallplay894,2009-04-17T01:21Z,"How long is it supposed to take to boot... It does this scrolling thing with lots of different loading commands, but then it stops at ""MAC Framework successfully initialized. using 16384 headers and 4096 cluster IO buffer headers."" and its been sitting like that for about an hour or so... what do I do!!!!"
,creepymitten,2009-04-23T21:14Z,"UWHuskyPD22:
That is supposed to happen.  After the boot sequence changes from DOS to Mac format, the words get smaller.  That means it's working correctly.  Just give it some time.

fgery1988:
Did you change the partition format to Mac OSX (Journaled)?


noworkallplay894:
It took about as long for this to boot as it does my real Mac machine."
,Reventorghini,2009-04-30T00:01Z,"Is there a way to install this without DVDs?  I just realized I only have a CD burner (though I do have some 700MBs if I it's possible to spread the ISO over a some of those and make it work).

I've already tried mounting in Daemon and that isn't doing anything."
,creepymitten,2009-05-01T01:06Z,"Reventorghini:
Get a DVD."
,TheCondor2012,2009-05-16T07:51Z,"wait a minute, it just says patched for PC use, and what else? a bit of more detail would be usefull like what mac os x version and what kernel, which drivers are included and what was done to this OSX Installation and bla bla bla. You get the point.... Its 4.3 Gigs we're talking about here ! i'd like to know what im downloading and what to expect from this download... thanks"
,s13igh,2009-06-14T21:40Z,"i downloaded this via Limewire and the files was downloading saying 4.38gb took about 5 hours but as soon as it had downloaded it was just 386mb? any idea why this is 

oh yea and it also came up as a iso rar file :S"
,ashmanly123,2009-06-21T16:25Z,"This wont boot. says samething like cant find boot / unable to boot. Really, waste of time in my opinion."
