I've got some good material on german, and I'm sharing it tonight (sorry but my upload speed is slooooow, so you'll have to be patience, don't worry I'll keep seeding till there are many seeds). It's good some books on runes and runemagick (among others), very, very, very nice. I'd like to ask, now that I have the oportunity, if you could upload some stuff about the seidr, the world tree, the path working with runes, etc. (i'm willing to get the edred thorson books). Thanks again, I'm always waiting for your uploads occult =D"
