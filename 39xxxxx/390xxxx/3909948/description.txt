            CHIP MUSIC IS DEAD dot Compilation


:: ABOUT ::

On the 31 of August, 2007, Ignatz posted a manifesto on both the 
Micromusic-forum and the LSDJ-mailing list where he declared the chip 
music dead. 
Why? Because he thought that Teh Mainstream is reaching to grip around 
the fragile retroneck of chip with it\\\\\\\'s claws of consuming that turn 
everything it touches into shit and effectively kill everything 
the culture stands for.

This compilation is a reaction to that manifesto. Is chip music and culture
truly dead? Is that a good thing? Is Ignatz wrong? Will we be consumed by
Mainstream? How can we defend our-self against the \\\\\\\"threat\\\\\\\"?
