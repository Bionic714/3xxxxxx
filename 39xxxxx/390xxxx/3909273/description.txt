not sure what has changed on it as there is no
true info on it as they have not 
givin version history on this version 
i just noticed it as i installed that 
it is indeed a different build because i checked 
my last build and it was only 2.2.3.258 now it has 
up to 2.2.3.258h so they have been doing letters now 
instead of numbers so enjoy from Slickinator

also this main file can be used a an upgrade also 
which will keep the registration intacted and 
still fully registered enjoy

if you use the keygen you may have to generate a couple
keys before you find a working one thanx
