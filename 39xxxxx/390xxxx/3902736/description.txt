Post-rock at it\'s best. This isn\'t a scene release, but unless your ears start bleeding when the .nfo is missing I suggest you get it.

Track list:
Dash & Blast
We Flood Empty Lakes
Illuminate My Heart, My Darling!
A Song For Starlit Beaches

I noticed that the last two tracks are named 03 ... and I\'m to lazy to fix it. Also, for some reason the first three tracks are 192kbps while A Song For Starlit Beaches is 201kbps vbr. I might stop seeding from times to times, but I\'ll try to keep it somewhat alive for as long as possible.

Cheers.
