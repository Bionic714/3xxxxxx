,wierdo124,2011-03-09T06:48Z,"Only a partial discography. This includes their albums Disciple (2005), and Scars Remain, but it's missing a couple songs. There's also more albums such as This Might Sting A Little, Horseshoes and Handgrenades, and Southern Hospitality. Those have torrents. There's some older albums that don't have torrents though."
