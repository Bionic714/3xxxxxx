    * Heavily cut titles.
    * Janine (played by Cate Blanchett) is cut.
    * Speeded-up some montages.
    * Angel does not go to Somerfields' and accuse Simon Skinner of the
      murders. An extra line from the deleted scenes was added to make
      it appear that Frank Butterman won't let Angel accuse Skinner of
      anything, let alone act on it. Angel just goes back to the hotel.
    * Extended fence jump scene.
    * Also cut some unfunny jokes & unnecessary lines.
    * Some scenes were trimmed.
    * Credits heavily edited, "Solid Gold Easy Action" song removed.


Your intention for this fanedit: HOT FUZZ was too long. So I felt I should cut it down to a more leaner, somewhat faster-paced and funner film.
