                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This week on Our World, we present Brian Stewart's feature documentary about 
the untold story behind the Afghanistan campaign. He explores how the Canadian 
military is selling the mission and boosting public support for it, as it also 
increases its political clout in Ottawa.

Brian writes: "In my reporting on the war in Afghanistan, I have often thought 
it interesting that despite Canada's costly involvement there, we have seen 
very little change in public attitudes towards the mission. If, two years ago, 
one had forecast that dozens of Canadians would be killed in Southern 
Afghanistan by 2007, with no clear success to the mission in sight, one might 
have predicted a strong current of anti-war sentiment emerging by now.

While there has been widespread criticism of the government's "lack of clarity" 
over Afghanistan, Canadians are today still equally divided; roughly half for 
the misson, half against. Remarkably, Canadians on the whole still support the 
mission more than civilians in European NATO countries do; even though we've 
taken more casualties, and face tougher fighting. So what has held up this 
level of support? It is, in part , because of a well-planned, but little 
understood, campaign by the military itself to control our perceptions of the 
conflict. In my regular "Inside the Mission" reports for the National News, 
I've been stuck by the massive public relations campaign orchestrated by 
Canada's top soldier General Rick Hillier. It led to my documentary 
exploration of this military PR offensive, one unprecedented since the Second 
World War. " The documentary was produced by Harry Schachter and edited by 
Claude Panet-Raymond.
