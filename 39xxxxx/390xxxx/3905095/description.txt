If there is interst I will compress and upload several episodes at a time. I have all 9 Seasons and The "10th" Season comprised of three made for tv movies.

Originally these had been uploaded on Demonoid by myself as full iso images, but I was unable to access the site as a Canadian.  When I learned how a proxy server worked I accessed my torrents, of the 61 Torrents, each 4.36gb were dying out.

Now, with the Demonoid servers gone, I know that many still wanted the series, especially in Sweden. So, I hope you enjoy my share, feedback would be appreciated.

I have never uploaded a new torrent to tpb, I hope this is a welcomed contribution to the community.

Please note I will dedicate my bandwidth to seeding this task for several days, to see if interest is there, please seed.
