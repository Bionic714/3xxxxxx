-=Product Description=-

Limited UK two disc (CD + PAL/Region 0 DVD) edition of the 2007 release from the Dutch Gothic Metal band featuring four bonus audio tracks (including one remix and three acoustic versions) plus a bonus DVD featuring nine clips filmed live in Tokyo, one game trailer and four music videos. Within Temptation have been pounding the Metal pavement with their unique brand of hard-edged Metal for over a decade. Their sound is the perfect combination of guitar-driven Hard Rock and ambitious Symphonic Metal. Underneath the aggressive wall of sound lies a secret beauty that can often be dark and uninviting. 13 tracks including 'Howling', 'Frozen' and 'Final Destination'.
