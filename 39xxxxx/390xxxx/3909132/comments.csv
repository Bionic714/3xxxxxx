,sivart7555,2007-12-11T02:53Z,"Figured it out. 
To burn
1.put all files in folder named ""Video_TS"".
2.Del the file named ""VIDEO_TS.VOB""
Burn all to disc and enjoy.
If it doesn't run the first time in your dvd player press menu on your remote."

Sivart7555 way can brick the dvd, at that moment you're unable to watch the dvd on a standalone dvdplayer

good luck! "
