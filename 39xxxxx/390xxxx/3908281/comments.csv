,infamousamazing,2007-11-27T05:23Z,"I created these files from a seven cassette book on tape I got from my library; I wanted to be able to listen to the book on my Ipod rather than switching tapes every 40 min. (yes, i'm that lazy).  I've never created/uploaded a torrent before and this seemed like it would make a fun experiment...I just opened the torrent from a second computer in my house and IT WORKS!!  If you want, I can make a Dharma Bums file...this may take a few days, I have to see if my library has the book on tape; if not I will have to order it from another library.  Check back periodically--this is so exciting!!!  :D"
,infamousamazing,2007-11-27T21:38Z,Just uploaded a torrent for Dharma Bums  :)
,infamousamazing,2007-11-29T05:30Z,"I'm going inpatient rehab tomorrow morning for at least the next 30 days so my computer will be off (not able to seed).  I hope these files have spread enough by now so that I am not the only source; if not, I am sorry and I will be back and seeding in about 30 days -- I HOPE  :-/"

,gatapirata,2012-05-13T17:14Z,"Has anyone else found that this skips in parts? Is it possible to fix it, or does anyone have a version that doesn't skip? Thanks!! I really like the way it's read, and would love to have a perfect copy."
