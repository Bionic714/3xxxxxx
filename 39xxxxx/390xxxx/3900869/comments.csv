FYI to potential downloaders - this is a MIXED ALBUM, so you're not actually downloading the 26-mp3s shown below, but rather ONE mp3 file thats just under 120 minutes long.

An included "".cue""-file tells your burning software where to split the tracks, a very nice rip job actually.

Well done and thanks again!"
