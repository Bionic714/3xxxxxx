ALEX JONES.

To some, he is the embodiment of american patriotism, up there in the sky with George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. 

To others, he is a hysteria monger, a sensationalist con-artist and a gatekeeper at best who is taking advantage of his gullible and ignorant fans in need of a leader to blindly cling to.

The main two audio files of this torrent are by Bill Cooper who seems to be of the latter opinion.

Bill Cooper (Milton William Cooper) (May 6, 1943 - November 5, 2001) was a former U.S. Naval Intelligence Briefing Team   Member, an American writer, radio broadcaster and political activist. Cooper was honorably discharged in 1965 from the U.S. Air force, and enlisted in the U.S. Navy in December of that year. He served in Vietnam, rising to the rank of petty officer. Cooper was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal with combat V and the Navy Achievement medal with combat V. He was honorably discharged in 1974.

In the 1990s Cooper's interest moved from UFOs, to covert government programs. He concluded that all UFO reports were New World Order Propaganda.

Bill Cooper has been murdered on November 05th 2001 (few weeks after 9-11) by officers of the Apache County Sheriff's Office (Arizona) during a confrontation that involved a gun battle.

Alex Jones' fans who haven't completely surrendered their ability to think for themselves yet are highly encouraged to study the content of this torrent.
