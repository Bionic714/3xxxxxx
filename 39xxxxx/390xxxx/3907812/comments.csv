Another 'patriot' that wimpers 'dont listen to jones' listen to me saying the same shit.....that I myself do little to nothing about .....

(mainly because I AM FUCKING DEAD).

zzzz....zzz......zzzz......zz......"
,duhprane,2007-11-25T04:39Z,"Well Ive listened to all this material and have found no reason that this collection of mp3s would be categorized under 'movies' or how any of it makes Alex Jones look bad or how it makes Bill Cooper look good

So what is your point here? Alex Jones doesn't know everything and Bill Cooper wasn't any glistening fountain of purest truth.

so tell me what am I supposed to be getting from this other than the proposed idea that unless I no longer trust Alex Jones I can't possibly be thinking for myself?

This is internal patriot movement old news baloney. This is Hatfield VS McCoys. 

I suggest everyone download and listen to it and wonder if this isn't really about how Jones took Cooper's audience away in one fell swoop."

,eastern876,2008-06-03T10:17Z,"For all listeners of Alex Jones and Coast to Coast AM, check out the following torrent:

In the 1980s, radio station KABC carried the ground-breaking radio program ""OPEN MIND"" with host Bill Jenkins.   The subject matter covered included UFOs, alternative energy, spirituality, ancient religions, and more.   Bill Jenkins later went on to host the classic film ""THE NAKED TRUTH"" with Jordan Maxwell, upon which the current internet hit ""ZEITGEIST"" is based.

The ""Open Mind"" radio programs have not been heard in many years ... until now.   We recently came into possession of a large collection of cassette tape recordings which had been made by a loyal listener, and had them digitized into MP3s.  This is a priceless collection of otherwise unattainable radio programs.   It is being freely shared here in an effort to make sure it is not lost to  history.

Yeah, the truth tends to divide the mice from the men doesnt it?

Alex tells you that those who blame Jews are disinfo. How? He says it causes infighting. Of course it does..because the truth is never accepted by all so it will naturally create hostility.

Duh."
,ricintoxin,2009-02-21T00:18Z,this is bogus
,thistleboy,2009-10-25T09:50Z,"If you can't destroy the truth, destroy those who speak it. Attacking Alex Jones without a shred of real evidence make you look like an alarmist tool. All you have are interpretations of speech, claims of lost footage and circumstance.

You don't seem to realize you're actually making a really good point here in being such an incredible tool. You're pissed because you want Alex Jones to spend him time and money finding evidence that Zionist and the Jewish state are responsible for a good deal of thing. Well, sorry to say, but the man just doesn't believe that. He's stated because he's not found the resounding evidence to support it as he has for things like the NWO/Illuminati, 911, etc.

You're pissed because he won't say what you want him to say. He won't think what you want him to think. He won't investigate what you want him to investigate. Well, he's got free will and he doesn't have to. He doesn't have to listen to you and believe what you believe any more than anyone else has to believe what he talks about just because he does. We all have free will and we can think what we want.

Don't attack him because he has a differing view. You come off like a piranha waiting for an excuse to eat one of your own."
,thistleboy,2009-10-25T09:55Z,"Before anymore piranha think they smell blood and start vomiting obscenities my way I felt it important to note that I'm of the mindset that Zionists are behind a whole hell of a lot of messed up shit that goes on in the world today. I also realize that not everyone is going to think the same.

That's why we need to come up with some good solid evidence to convince people like Alex Jones. If you want to test your Zionist-Jones theory you need to do the same investigative legwork as he does with his subject matter. Find that smoking gun and present it to him. When he denies it's existence then, that's when you'll have a case and people like me will consider his ulterior motives for denying evidence."
,whogivesasnot,2011-09-22T03:19Z,"William Cooper himself reported seeing a UFO. It's in the first chapter of his book.

Alex Jones isn't perfect but he isn't a con-artist. He'll tell you himself that he isn't anybody special. He has said some questionable things but haven't we all when we were younger. When I look at him I see a sincere person concerned for America.

Alex is a great source of information but definitely not the only or end-all source. You should always think for yourself and do your own research."
