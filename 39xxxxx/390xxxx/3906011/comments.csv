,obliation,2008-08-06T19:38Z,"what mediaplayer do you people use to watch this movie? I use VLC, but its like watching tv with really really bad reception, wich makes half the screen go byebye. i've also tried Windows media player, Bs player and winamp but none of them could open the file at all. 

what is this super media player I dont know about that can make this film work like its supposed to do..

The half of the screen that actualy works looks great, thanks for the upload!"
