it allows you to visualize in your own PC several hundreds of channels of televisi?n that they emit by Internet, and to also listen to m?s of a thousand of radio transmitters that emit their seÂąal through the radio. The program does not need ning?n type special hardware (capturadora card of televisi?n) since it receives the audio-visual content in ""streaming"" through Internet. L?gicamente, whichever greater is the bandwidth of your conexi?n, greater quality of image and sound. Super Internet TV includes adem?s a autom?tica system of actualizaci?n, so that always tendr?s the updated channels m?s. Without a doubt an entertained form to know other cultures, to practice languages or simply to see what puts in the radio chains and televisi?n of others paĂ¸ses."

What the heck is the problem, use english or post it in some spanish torrenttracker.
Cant understand shit of the info file!"
,plasmidjunkie,2007-11-23T05:01Z,"if any english people were wondering the readme file on the inside of the stuff reads ""In the first place, we execute the file of installation of the program without opening it.  For crackear the program we will copy the 3 files of the folder ""Crack"" and we will substitute them for the existing in its folder of
installation."" (thats an exact translation from a website LOL)"

I guess thats why PINCHE sud y centro america are so far ahead in the space program, and other things such as that.

si es verdad que soy un norte...pero la verdad es que pinche pendejos como uds. se mandan basura por el internet,  y nadie en el mundo le gusta, y nos causa a pensar que todos los bean-shitting-mulattos son mala gente.

,akiRamenai,2008-06-23T19:37Z,"stilL...no VIRUS, SPYWARE, TROJAN, MALWARE, whatever you name it. Scanned by Kaspersky Internet Security 7 (tuesday, June 24, 12.44 AM)"
,oggologgo,2008-09-27T19:42Z,"DON'T INSTALL! It contains MALWARE!

This program puts winvercheck.exe in your startup.

Also the program is useless anyway. Most of the stations do not work. The rest can be found on webpages anyway, like on streamick.com and sites like it. So don't install this malware for that.

Read:

ATTENTION! MALWARE!

... ""winvercheck.exe"" which is copied to ""c:\windows\"" plus it creates a key in ""hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\runonce"" starting ""winvercheck.exe"" next boot.
This is a Malware Dropper, downloading Trojans (Agent, ZLOB) an spyware (fakealert, ADSpy).

BEFORE REBOOT DELETE ""winvercheck.exe"" AND DELETE THE REGISTRY KEY RUNNING IT!!!"
