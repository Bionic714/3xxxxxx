,Mohammedin,2007-11-25T16:48Z,NICE SEEED SPEED :)!
[T],relentlesstech,2007-11-26T00:30Z,"Right now I am the only MAIN seeder, but I am hoping the speeds will be even better once a few people have the whole thing [ Assuming others seed, too! ] - I am also running an FTP server, so the torrent speeds will fluctuate from time to time, but 60+ KB/s should be the normal VAERAGE speed..."
,Hassonn,2007-11-26T11:10Z,"Hey

Nice Torrent ;) :P 

Can you pleazz seed?

When it finnish, I seed to ;) "
[T],relentlesstech,2007-11-27T12:20Z,"Come on, people - SEED!!!  I have had 4 people get the whole thing, and as soon as they're done, they stop seeding - Please, just seed it a little bit to ease the traffic on my PC, and to make this faster for everyone!"
,MartinHenc86,2007-11-27T16:13Z,iam gonna put my dl client on master seed =)
[T],relentlesstech,2007-11-27T20:11Z,"Seeders are starting to pick up - 8 people have already gotten 100% of it now, and I have about 200 or so over 90%, so it's going to start going even faster!  Thanks to everyone for seeding :)"
,Proxydxddl,2007-11-27T23:46Z,"Nice seed.. 

Would't i be good if you who already have downloadet this Torrent. 
Seed at least 2GB, just to make it fair?..
You Done, plz help oss getting done, so we can take youre part?:
Regards"
[T],relentlesstech,2007-11-28T01:35Z,"I have a lot more good games and other stuff to share, but I need to be sure people are actually going to seed it after - This and NFS: Carbon [ Collector's Edition ] are my 2 'test torrents' - If these get seeded well, I'll put a bunch more stuff up - It makes it easier on my FTP server to run torrents ;)"
,gortax,2007-12-02T16:47Z,SEED! Please
,antihero.,2007-12-02T20:18Z,"ok, you guys all say its nice seeding... but does the game work?!"
,richmire23,2007-12-03T20:37Z,"hey. im having a problem with the game..it will load into the game no problem but when i go into the career to start the first race the game exits and says nfsps has stopped working there is no solution for this probelm.  there's a black thing that pops up to behind it that says something about punkbuster.

no master query sent - DNS has not yet resolved for masterg.exe. can someone help plz?"
,Wuhla,2007-12-06T22:50Z,"Hey relentlesstech
Thanks for the seeding, but what's the address to your ftp server?
I know that would be alot faster"
[T],relentlesstech,2007-12-07T15:38Z,"My FTP is private - I'm trying to divert traffic from it by starting to make torrents - Easier on the server ;)

I don't know what the 'PunkBuster' thing is - I have been playing the game for over a week now, and have had not one problem [ Other than not being able to beat Ryo Showdown! ]..."
,kenny007_007,2007-12-10T01:08Z,"i can't start it..?

,peterhard,2007-12-16T09:26Z,"Don't download! Doesn't work. It isn't an ISO - it's just rar'd up so you can't do anything with it. USELESS. 

If it can be used at all, then creator should say HOW to ""mount"" a non-iso file! No .mds file can be created from any of it either. "
[T],relentlesstech,2007-12-17T13:00Z,"Mount the ISO in Deamon tools to install, replace the game EXE with the cracked one, and that's it - I have been playing this for weeks now, so don't tell me it doesn't work!"

,hyperfreak24,2007-12-20T18:35Z,"Hi, relentlesstech
I'm using Utorrent 1.7.5 and it always says 'Error:Incorrect Parameters' every 5 minutes and stops the download. It also notes the trailer zip as 124kb. In fact as I'm writing this it stopped 2 times in 5 minutes. I tried it 4-6 times using all combinations of saveing destinations, opening the torrent and saving the torrent to my hard disk and the opening it. My bulk email is spammytrash@hotmail.com and I know it would be hard on your server but I would really appreciate if I could download it straight from the ftp address. I won't share it with anyone if that's your desire, which is why I included my email.
Cheers,
           Thanx in advance and Happy Holidays"
,hyperfreak24,2007-12-20T18:37Z,BTW: When I force start it ever 5 minutes my peek speed is 5kbps even when I have 60+ peers and I'm uploading what I have.
,Zayla,2007-12-22T20:27Z,"Peter,  what do you mean you cant do anything with it?

 UNZIP IT.    DL Winrar, and extract the files.  Simple.   Just because you dont know what a .rar file is, or how to use it doesnt mean the torrent doesnt work.   Google is your friend.

  Thx for the up!"
,soselo,2007-12-24T20:17Z,"hi there. im downloading this for about couple of weeks. the speed wouldnt go faster than 15 once a day, average speed is 2-4kbps. could u help me how to speed it up. usually movies does with 20-25kbps and done in 10 hours. any helping ideas?

I've been downloading this because the fucking idiot calling himself ""HKZonda"" uploaded this fucking torrent that doesn't even have a fucking MDS! Then he uploads an MDS fix claiming that it works flawlessly when nothing even happens so I started again on this one but then I'm only on 40% and then no one is fucking seeding how long do you think would it take to download 3 fucking gigabytes at a rate of 2 fucking kilobytes per second?"
,Boeing747400er,2008-06-03T20:06Z,"To hyperfreak24:

Try using the latest Free Download Manager. It supports Torrent files but I can't see and difference of speed on mine. If FDM doesn't work, I don't know    
how I can help you."
