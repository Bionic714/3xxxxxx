Very Funny British panel comedy sort-a-ish like jeopardy.  You lose points for giving predictable/urban myth type answers.

Witty dialog, quick, and clever responses. A bit of British charm from quiz master Steve Fry.

This show is currently airing season 5 so be sure to catch it live if it airs where you are.


This is a part promotion/part access for my fellow north Americans to get access to a very very funny show i found on demonoid shortly before its demise.
