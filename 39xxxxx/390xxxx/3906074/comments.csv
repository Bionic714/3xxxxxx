,FlightSimerr,2007-11-24T04:05Z,"st. marteen I beleive it's the only one they have for FSX and they do not have it for sale yet. I think they're going to sell it once service pack 2 comes out for fsx. 
Anyone have any problems?? Let me know i'll help. "

[T],stevekasian,2007-11-24T14:42Z,"Now that would be COOL - FlyTampa releases all their new airports with a ""Pay whatever you think it's worth, if anything"" rule... Hell yeah!  I'd give 'em $5 an airport. Heck, I'd give Cloud9 $10.  :D"

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3898995/SKAI_Traffic_v2.3_for_Flight_Simulator_9__amp__X

Absolutly the best traffic u can get.

If u are in for exemple england, its many british airways and virgin airlines so u can go to every country and see there real airlines with more from other countries."
