I found this floating around the net. I've used it on my hacked FSX deluxe with Accelration. It worked fine for me and looks almost identical to the FS9 version without the moving vehicles. 

Ths is not a Beta and is also not the final version. It's an early release but from what I can tell it is close to complete. 

Good Luck

Serial is included!
