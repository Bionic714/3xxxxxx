[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-11-22T19:08Z,This is the 64-bit version of XP Pro. Enjoy!
,daystogo90,2007-11-22T19:18Z,um....when you say corperate does that mean anything different with it  cause Ive been wanting to upgrade to 64bit for a while know and this is just my home computer  
[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-11-23T02:45Z,Corperate just means that you do not need to worry about activation and Microsoft's WGA. 
[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-11-23T02:46Z,"If you want to upgrade to 64-bit, make sure your system is 64-bit compatible. Otherwise, then obviously it would not work."
,daystogo90,2007-11-23T05:26Z,oh yea Iam ready and able to upgrade to x64  thats why I was wanting it so thank you very much hellraiser
[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-11-23T17:05Z,You're very welcome! Enjoy this torrent :)
,del-bert,2007-11-23T20:08Z,What about drivers ? Does this have most of the ones XP-32 bit has ?
,daystogo90,2007-11-23T20:09Z,ok everybody I am going to upgrade now so I will let you all know that it works aslong as my computer dont blow up or anything LOL
,90daystogo,2007-11-23T21:29Z,Yep it works  the only thing you need to remember to do first is put on disk important info you dont want to lose and write down passwords shit like that so you dont have to re register a new fucking name on every site you go too.  other then that it works great  my computer works faster allready and better good one hellraiser
[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-11-23T22:21Z,"ahh, glad it worked for you! Enjoy x64 goodness!"

,90daystogo,2007-11-26T01:35Z,hey everybody this thing rocks its so much better then xp x32 bit  if you can up grade to this I recommend you do so
,90daystogo,2007-11-26T03:06Z,thanks for the avast yea it was easy and it seems like its pretty good too  cant beat that for free
,judasmyguide,2007-11-27T18:55Z,"Thx! Will download thisone!  Never tried x64. But I've bought new hardware, so it shouldn't be a problem. I still wonder... What about all my programs I've used with 32bit? Does it work with x64? Like nero, ad-aware, avast and so on.(many small helpful prg) Can i use those prg. or do i have to get them in x64 versions?"
,judasmyguide,2007-11-27T19:09Z,And can i install windows updates with this version?
,bullet tooth,2007-11-27T20:15Z,What programme would you recommend to burn this to CD/DVD?
[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-11-27T23:09Z,"When you upgrade to x64, all x86 (32 bit) applications work perfectly just like your old 32-bit OS. All 32-bit apps run exactly the same -- if not BETTER --- than a regular 32-bit OS. 

Yes, Updates work perfectly fine. 

I recommend PowerISO, MagicISO, ISORecorder (free WindowsXP tool) or Nero. "
,judasmyguide,2007-11-27T23:24Z,Thanks for the answer.  Not many of uploaders who reply all questions. Very helpful!  Thumbs up mm3.  :-)
,judasmyguide,2007-11-27T23:30Z,Oh one thing.. is sp1 or sp2 included?
,90daystogo,2007-11-28T06:59Z,yea everybody upgrade to this it works great all my games and programs work fine only faster and better this is my favorite torrent this works and Ive even been downloading older games and stuff and they work fine.
,90daystogo,2007-11-28T07:00Z,sorry dont know what sp1 or sp2 means otherwise I would answer  Iam just a noob on a computer trying to not fuck up too bad
,90daystogo,2007-11-28T10:25Z,do you mean system pack cause all you need to do is use windows auto update and it will update for you no prob  this works great  
,judasmyguide,2007-11-28T12:40Z,"90daystogo: I ment servicpack(sp) Some versions comes with this. When you install xp, it automaticly installs sp1 (sp2 preferred):-)
So again: is sp1 or sp2 included?

I see you like this one, so I will give it a try."
[T],mm3_hellraiser,2007-11-29T01:25Z,"Actually, I myself am not sure ._.

But, as suggested, when you get it installed, just go to Windows Update and all will be well.

My apologies to dial-up users..."
,90daystogo,2007-11-29T08:03Z,yea you get servie pack 1 and I updated to service pack 2 with the auto update
,judasmyguide,2007-11-30T09:34Z,"Ok thank you!  Can I download win mediaplayer 11? As far as I can remember, it will connect to microsoft and check the validation, and boom.. game over?!!"
,judasmyguide,2007-11-30T09:37Z,"And one more thing about the servicepack: Is it separate versions, one used with 23bit and one with 64bit? Or does it cover them both?"
,90daystogo,2007-11-30T10:56Z,yea I think you can get the mediaplayer11 I think I got it and I dont know if it covers both 32 and 64 but I dont know what would be different if it did not so I think its all good 
,90daystogo,2007-11-30T10:57Z,Pretty sure covers both  but Iam still a noob so dont quote me
,katalystcastle,2007-12-06T07:39Z,i think 32 bit media player is different in 64 bit because theres a patch for windows media player 11 in xp x64... thats what i though...
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2007-12-24T21:52Z,"Thx for this, hellraiser.....this is exactly what I've been lookin for for my nForce x64 system. If windows OSs didn't cost so damn much then I'd buy them. As it stands, however, they charge an arm and a leg....even though you could just learn how to use Linux, lol. I swear...it's highway robbery, lol. ANYways....perfect install...no probs with setup....though my mobo's drivers aren't there...and thus my OB-Ethernet isn't recognized. Easy to find the drivers though....EPoX should have'em. All in all, I rate this rip a 97.8% out of 100%.....Editor's Choice速"
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2007-12-24T22:43Z,"Well ok then.....this is a slight issue on Microskrew...I mean Microfuck....er....Microsoft's part....as well as my mobo's manufacturer....x64 support on the mobo....and yet no x64 drivers to speak of....none. This techie's getting irritated, lol. Other than the driver issues, this is a great find. NO VIRUSES OR SPYWARE TO SPEAK OF AT ALL!!....so if any |\|0085 decide that they wanna dip-shit this torrent they should rethink their decision and try again and again until they get it strait with the installation and configurations......(which I might add are a bit of a pain if your system has slightly older hardware.....you may wanna check your hardware manufacturer's sites to see if they have the drivers prior to installing this release. Other than that.....it's perfect)."
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2007-12-24T22:45Z,Oh....almost forgot btw....this release has SP1 built in...in case that helps at all.
,Kazae_The_Wolf,2007-12-25T03:37Z,"Ok....finally got all the drivers I needed and then some....heh.....""It's aLiVe!!!!"" As I posted b4....the x64/64-bit drivers for hardware are a bit of a pain to find sometimes. I've been testing the system's stabilty and the stress tests seem to have been successful.....the system is optimal to the point of blazing. (If I didn't know any better, I'd think my system would catch on fire with how fast this thing runs now, rofl....j/k.) Ironicly, the drivers were easier to find than I had orriginally speculated and they seem to work perfectly. as of now I'm raising my rating of this torrent to 99.3% Golden Choice Award & Editor's Choice Award速"
,good4abonk,2007-12-25T11:40Z,it was installing good for a while but then it couldn't copy the msi.dll or anything else related. that sucks too cause I thought this one would actually work. thanx anyway
,warfox101,2008-02-23T19:00Z,this is just what im looking for. But need more seeders
,jus4kix,2008-04-05T06:16Z,downloaded and bunrt to cd perfectly but when i tried to install it say that this version of windows cannot be installed. Can some-one tell me why?
,rad2905,2008-10-10T23:57Z,"Can anyone tell me if there is a serbian under regional options? I need to install serbian keyboard, and the x64 edition that i have doesn't have that..."
,HarleyThePirate,2008-10-12T00:48Z,"Could someone SEED this thing??!! This looks like a good version, I started downloading it but it's coming ridiculously slow at like 0,2kb/s and now just hung.!! Cmon seed, PLEASE"
,upm,2008-11-02T10:33Z,jus4kix : thats the answer you get when you try to install a x64 system on a 86/32 system os.
,Firestorm-x99,2009-07-09T12:17Z,Currently only 1 seed @ 0.7kb/s
,adelonic,2010-01-24T01:11Z,everythings works ok but internet not working i have dual boot windows 7 internet works fine there is a problem on network devises
