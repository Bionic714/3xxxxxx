,sterbik,2007-11-27T17:47Z,"""so what language is this? and what does croatian mean""

Stupid people like this one above makes me mad!

It has been told 4 times that this is a Slovenian version. So what the fuck is so hard in this to understand???

If you wouldn't know, ""Croatian"" is a language. I cant believe you actually asked such an idiot question like that! Now you probably know what does ""language mean""."
,Cypris,2007-11-30T06:10Z,"Lol wow, first off: Sterbik: nice English. Second off, jeff123, dont listen to any of these assholes. Asking questions is always a better idea than assuming something. Its fucktards like these people that make asking questions in forums a very painful task.  However, they do have a point, which is: it says the language in the description, try to read these carefully before asking questions. :)"
