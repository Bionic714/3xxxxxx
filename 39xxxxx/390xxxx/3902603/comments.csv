,.RM.,2007-11-21T20:59Z,Thank you a lot!!! Any chance you upload all 6 episodes in 720p? I'll seed them for sure!
,tbone4690,2007-11-22T06:28Z,"This is from comcast on demand, in the cinemax hd area. Prob ripped from that, so he prob doesn't have all the other eps."
,Eyeless10,2008-03-05T00:31Z,"Just a heads up, this release is not Widescreen. :("
,Eyeless10,2008-03-05T00:33Z,"Wow, sorry for jumping the gun, media player zoomed fullscreen on me. This one is Widescreen sorry about the last post. Great upload!"
,TheCool34,2008-04-30T23:46Z,Does any one know if u watch 3 and when it ends 4 stars from where 3 left off?
,spaceroach,2008-07-06T21:33Z,"^
Is that supposed to be a new meme? -_-

Yes, 3 ends, 4 takes place after, long enough for infants Luke and Leia to become adults (~20 years or so)."
,julenissen123,2008-11-10T22:22Z,"hi just gotta ask, but could you upload episode 2 too. would be great. btw great upload. thanks a lot."
,Grenadeh,2009-06-06T17:41Z,"Was that supposed to be a serious question? It doesn't matter if you were born in 1999 theres literally no excuse for not having seen the first three Star Wars movies. They were released on four separate occasions on VHS and DVD in addition to the original and special edition theatrical releases.

Episode 3 takes place 19 years before Episode 4 but A new Hope doesn't necessarily start where it ""left off"" because it was released 28 years before episode 3 was, but essentially it serves as a sequel because there is story happening between all 6 movies that you don't see. "
