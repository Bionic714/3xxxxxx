Witness the soul-less animation of facial motion capture - and pointless high speed action of a story that really doesn't teach anything or convey any real moral message outside of 'belief makes something real' and how to waste some time....."
,Amerialb,2007-11-25T17:55Z,Yeah.......Great movie too!
,tiffany22,2007-12-02T05:58Z,Thanks! The kids will love it.

This is a cool flick! So what if it isn't live people, it's great CGI and a great movie. Believing does make something real. Christmas spirit!
When people stop believing, they grow hard and cold. Maybe that's why a few hard hearted jerks work hard to try to remove the meaning of the season from anything they can.
Merry Christmas, everyone!"

,cyaroyal,2010-12-24T21:26Z,"thanks Booster2.  The avi was v10/a9 (sound was a little low) but ConvertXtoDVD didn't like the audio which came out very tinny/squeaky, not good at all; video was ok."
,Spambolo,2011-02-05T12:53Z,"Thankyou Booster2, I wasn't expecting too much from this, but it surpassed every expectation I had. Gorgeous, detailed art style and beautiful animation, everything beautifully nuanced and well voice acted. Plus, the kids LOVED it! If I ever see this on DVD it's a definite keeper. :)"
,stphsimpson,2011-12-04T22:24Z,"this is for duphrane comment even though it is a few years later, but also to anyone that feels the way he does.  without belief and hope what is there, especially in times that are hard. this movie is about much more that sant, it is about the fact that belief and faith can work miracles.  sry to folks like duphrane have had lives so hard that they no longer believe in faith which is all we all really have sometimes."
