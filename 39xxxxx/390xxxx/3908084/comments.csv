,Thyrosis,2007-11-29T11:41Z,"Before you spend 8 hours downloading this: 
these are NOT seperate tracks!

Would've been nice to know that before I downloaded it, but hey =)"
,stephenrocky,2007-12-01T23:56Z,the best album for a long time well done webchella
,RoninStorm,2007-12-04T21:24Z,Each CD is one file. This woulda been the best up ever if it woulda been seperate mp3's.
,RoninStorm,2007-12-04T21:34Z,mp3DirectCut. search for it. its a free program i just found out about and you can cut this into individual tracks yourself. enjoy
,Beev,2007-12-06T17:34Z,"RoninStorm,

does that program automatically find the beginning/end of each tracks?

Yours,

,huggienyc,2007-12-06T19:16Z,its a mix album so why complain about it not being seperate tracks you phantom
,Capt Pugwash,2007-12-09T01:01Z,"Great album, and excellent copy.

Each cd is one big mp3 file. The tracks are mixed together, so you won't know where one finishes and the next one starts, so best not try to separate.

Just may be a bit difficult if you want to skip some tracks, but there are no bad ones on this release."
,fellachap,2007-12-09T11:11Z,"Burning to disk using the image file separates the mp3's into tracks. Bit of a waste of 3 disks but probably the quickest and easiest way of doing it.

Good up by the way"
