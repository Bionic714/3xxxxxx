The Inspector Wears Skirts (Cynthia Rothrock, 1988) - Rmvb

Avg. Rating:  3.8 / 5 (based on 4 ratings).

Plot: A group of female commando trainees with a knack for pranks are being trained by taskmasters Sibelle Hu and Cynthia Rothrock. But despite all their playfulness, their training is put to the test when they are assigned to catch some jewel thieves. 
 
Overview: A shockingly sexy Sibelle Hu is a hard-ass training officer in charge of a group of female commando trainees which have a knack for pranks and getting into trouble (think "Stripes" or "Police Academy" here). These girls consist of Sandra Ng, femme fighter Wei Ying Hung, pro ice skater turned action actress Anne Bridgewater, Regina Kent, and a dozen other cuties. After a brief appearance in the opening action piece, Interpol agent Cynthia Rothrock shows up an hour into the film to complete the girls' training. Throughout the training, the girls are constantly teasing each other, pulling pranks, and trying to sneak away with the boys from the rival Tiger Squad. The real action comes in the last twenty minutes when both teams are assigned to catch some jewel thieves headed up by Jeffrey Falcon and everything goes to hell.
