,jpspoodle1,2007-11-25T06:29Z,I tried to remove the ?Patent Activation Fail? by going to check updates and under license delete the demo serial and then restart my computer but it won?t let me.  The computer keeps stating ? If you want to remove Nero products use the uninstall option instead?.  My time is just about up on the ?demo?.  Is there another way to remove that line?  Or does anybody have a key?  Thanx!

,coprod,2007-12-03T14:40Z,Thanks for the key dirtyodesertdog. Hope it works in a month as well.
