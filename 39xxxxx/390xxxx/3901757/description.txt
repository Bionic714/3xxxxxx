This Collection is From an Album which has no Company Name, Logo etc
As is was Not released and only the Cover being 1 Sheet printed paper.

The Platters not only made this album but from the Photo of the cover you will see
that it is also Autographed by all members of the group.

I used high quality equiptment and software to create these MP3s. but still has some of the crackles from the viynl
this also shows some origanal recording from the media.

The Sounds of The Platters, LP also has just a Plain Black label with white text on it.


No record company info on it anywhere.


This is something special or what.

Platters fan will love it as part of their collection





Good Luck and Enjoy
 

Also this is my first torrent
