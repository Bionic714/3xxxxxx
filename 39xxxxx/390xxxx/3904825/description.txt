This Show is really amazing. I am sad there was only 6 episodes and I do sure hope that they will shoot another :) I watched this series in one night and payed the next day at work but it was worth it.

This show is about some conspiracy with some people in some country more in IMDB ;)

The file format is divx and the quality is really high (dunno if HD or not but i do not care about things i cannot see anyway come back with good quality once we have virtual reality)

Unfortunately I was not able to find a not subbed version of the 6th Episode and what should I say it is hard coded but at east if you are french you will be able to understand the last episode :P the other episodes are not subbed and none of them is dubbed.

ENJOYYYY I KNOW I DID!!! :)

(What torrent can I make next? :S)
