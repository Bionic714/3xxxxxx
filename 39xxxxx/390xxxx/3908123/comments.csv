,kenderlover,2007-11-26T04:46Z,"I must apologize, AGAIN.
For the torrent previously released by me had two identical songs in the album named V채re: tracks 10 & 11 were, actually, only the track 11. For those who have already taken them, I am now uploading the true track 10: Varis eloinen. Sorry for the trouble once again.

SEARCH FOR ""TENHI - 10 - VARIS ELOINEN (REAL SONG)"" in order to fix it."
