"
,obidon,2007-12-01T00:08Z,im using uTorrent and doing initial-seeding (aka super seeding) so hopefully that will help
,Skirbe,2007-12-06T22:38Z,Need seeders plz
,raindr0ps,2007-12-09T09:13Z,"Initial seeder is really needed here. Once a full torrent is finally uploaded he can go ahead and delete the files from his hard drive, there'll be plenty of seeders out there. I currently show about 200 leechers trying to get these files.

btw, I also use Utorrent but have no idea what ""initial-seeding (aka super seeding)"" means. I've been unable to find any such setting in Utorrent.

,raindr0ps,2007-12-12T05:35Z,"Yo, obidon,  I understand needing to clear some HD space but if you'd uploaded torrents for EACH video instead of all together, you would have been able to clear some HD space after each torrent was multilple seeded. As it is, the whole thing needs to be completely seeded before you can clear your HD of all six videos. Also would have made it easier for leechers to grab the files only they wanted. Don't mean this to be criticism, just a help tip. Thanks for thinking of other leechers like me.
"
,raindr0ps,2007-12-12T05:49Z,"OOPs, I meant to say ""other leechers like me until I get a full torrent then I, too, can be a seeder"".
Thanks again, obidon!
"
,obidon,2007-12-17T23:36Z,"np, raindrop.  the initial seeding setting is a checkbox that you can enable if you double-click a torrent.  and also it says that there is now 108 seeders and only 30 leechers.  is that enough now and can i clear my HD? (i won't until i get a response)."
,raindr0ps,2007-12-17T23:45Z,"Many, many thanks, obidon. It was slow going but you stuck with it and uploaded it all. 
BTW, I did a little research on ""initial seeding"" and figured that one out right after your comment here. Something I'd missed. I got more from this torrent than just eye candy, I got an edikashun!!  Thanks again."
,obidon,2007-12-20T21:53Z,ok cool.  so is there enough seeders so that i can delete the files now? 
,Mann2006,2008-01-01T17:34Z,If you have already uploaded it to 108 other people then yeah you can delete it.
,raindr0ps,2008-01-30T23:19Z,"Yo! obidon, sorry for the late reply. I suspect you have already cleared your HD. Thanks, for the torrent. Looks like there are multiple ""happy campers"" out there now, I know I am."
,toddmister,2008-02-09T13:46Z,"hello, is the quality worth burning to disk?"
,vwvr9,2008-04-04T18:10Z,"Thanks dude, awesome"
,opeth51,2008-05-18T03:27Z,u idiot thisisawsome. thats not girls gone wild. its short clips of wild girls.
,hazmat2,2008-06-26T01:01Z,"A super-seeder won't show up as a seed.  That's the whole point.  It actually speeds up the seeding process because it doesn't let anyone connect to the seeder for the full file, only pieces so that eventually there are multiple copies of the file all at once in a shorter amount of time."
