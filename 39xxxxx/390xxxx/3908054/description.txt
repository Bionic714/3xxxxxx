Two traveling companions, George (Ray Lovelock) and Edna (Christine Galbo), come across a small town infested with the "living dead" that are satisfying their cannibalistic hunger on anyone they come across. Discovering that an agricultural machine using radiation waves is at the root of all the havoc, George and Edna fight for survival and their innocence as they are pursued by a relentless detective (Arthur Kennedy) who is convinced they are responsible for the ghoulish acts of violence plaguing the countryside. All this leads to a gruesome showdown at the Manchester Morgue - an ending that knots a horrifying twist in the lives of all involved!
