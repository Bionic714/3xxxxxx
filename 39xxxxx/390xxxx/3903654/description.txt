St. Elsewhere was a weekly drama series that originally ran on NBC from October 26, 1982 to May 25, 1988. The series was set in a decaying urban teaching hospital called St. Eligius Hospital (named for St. Eligius), in Boston's South End neighborhood (said at the time to be based on Boston City Hospital, now Boston Medical Center). The hospital's nickname, "St. Elsewhere," is medical industry slang for poor hospitals that serve patients not wanted by the more prestigious institutions. As a medical drama, St. Elsewhere dealt with serious issues of life and death, though episodes also included a substantial amount of black comedy.

Although the series never ranked higher than 49th place in the yearly Nielsen Ratings, it maintained a large enough audience to last six seasons and 137 episodes, and the show is frequently mentioned in discussions about television series finales, due to its own provocative ending. It was produced by MTM Enterprises, which found success with Hill Street Blues around the same time. (The shows were often compared to each other for their ensemble casts and serial storylines.)
