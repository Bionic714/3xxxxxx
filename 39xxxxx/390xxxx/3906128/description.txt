ne of the best webcomics ever! Created by Ryan North, it's a comic strip featuring talking dinosaurs, with nonsensical discussions about philosophies, everyday life and stuff. One curious thing about the comic is that EVERY strip have the same art (cliparts, by the way), in the same position. 

You can read the comic on the site http://www.qwantz.com/.

In the "about" section of the site, Ryan encourages the sharing of his comics, but you should consider buying his book, "The Best of Dinosaur Comics: 2003-2005 AD".

Ripped it with the SpiderZilla extension for Mozilla Firefox.
