Your pc is probably missing the same file as mine did.
COMDLG32.OCX
Google for the file and download it, then the game will work!
Good Luck!"
,didomusicuk,2008-01-10T22:14Z,"Piece of shit torrent...

Fucking clueless uploader. Torrents are NOT meant to be made like this. For a start its in fucking millions of parts and its zipped, meaning that you have to download the whole fucking thing no matter what you want.

ASSHAT."

,Harry Q Hammer,2008-03-20T18:02Z,"Hey dildoschmuck (didomusicuk),

Guess what?  You're the clueless uploader!  Sure enough, a quick check shows that you haven't uploaded a single torrent and also you are definitely a noob as you can't even guess why the file was split into parts of 100MB.  (Hint: it wasn't done to annoy noobs like you, there was an actual reason in the beginning.  See if you can find out.  Do some research online (if you know how...).

Your type never cease to amaze me - you are so ignorant of all things techie, you never contribute to anything online and yet you are so fucking opinionated - without any facts, of course.

This Mega Games Pack series is really well put together, with the latest games, a nifty proprietary menu system and screenshots and synopses (that's plural of synopsis, tit) for every game.  Furthermore, 99% of the games are cracked and work perfectly.  The group that puts these games packs together has forgotten more about IT than you will ever know in your whole miserable noob lifetime!

What have you done lately?

You are fucking waste of oxygen!

Go fuck yourself!

,redfoxredfox,2008-03-31T08:00Z,"What the hell is your problem, Harry Q Hammer? maybe didomusicuk is an ignorant twat, maybe he isn't, but he's got a point, you know, most people downloading this pack want it for one game that they can't find anywhere else, and that just makes it a billion times harder for them. I know because i am one of those people. I'm sure as hell not waiting for 4.29 GB to download when all i want is a "
,ciuuwb,2008-04-15T17:21Z,"redfoxredfox, Dont Download It then, Simple Enough. Nightwolf took his OWN time to put this together and upload, he didn't have to, But he did. :-)

Great upload btw ;-)"
,Sweetleaf69,2008-04-23T01:31Z,"hey does anyone know what file deadhunt is in?
i downloaded and played the demo for it and its awesome! so simple yet so brilliant... anyway if one of you guys could find out and tell that would be great, by the way good download, i havent got it yet but its looks like a really good collection with lots of handy features"
,Sweetleaf69,2008-04-23T01:34Z,"oh yeah thanks to all you seeders out there.
nothing better then a speedy download!"
,door2summer,2008-05-04T18:12Z,Thanks for a great upload. I'm not sure what all the drama is about- download took less than overnight and install was a piece of cake. Me thinks people just don't like using the iso mounting.

,calgary_92,2008-06-19T15:47Z,thanks nightwolf81 for this game.like it very mutch
,screamo1337,2008-06-21T07:11Z,"Holy shit people are too bitchy on here. If you don't like the way it's uploaded or the format of the files, don't download it, easy as hell. The only thing you can do is download it and fix it yourself and upload it, if you don't wanna do that than shut up sit back and wait for someone else to do, just don't bitch up a storm about it, at least nightwolf took time to do this.

And Harry Hammer, you can't say shit about uploading didomusick cause the only thing you've uploaded is Gilmore Girls."
,krutok,2008-06-25T23:53Z,"MVP4: MegaVirusPack. Loaded with tons of viruses, new kinds. Some custom. Download if you enjoy trojans on your computer."
,atlantisisdead,2008-06-29T23:21Z,"I appreciate all the work, but I also only wanted a few games that I can't find by themselves, and probably never will. Please don't tell me to fuck myself, though, I prefer someone else doing it for me ; )  However, I was wondering.. I am a noob, and everyone HATES us, but everyone was a noob at some point, so YOU were hated once too.. woohoo! Anyway, I like making flash objects and was thinking about a nifty presentation for cracked games to play and/or download off cd and charge for it to my local pals and word of mouth from there.. a minimal fee for all my effort in downloading and compiling and making a menu and a cool manager for all the games. But, it seems folks are doing that at no fee. Can't figure why. You will absolutely chow down on someone who wanted only one game, but you won't charge for you work compiling and organizing all the games. You will steal from software makers, saying buy it if you like it, heh heh, but would probably tear me limb by limb for selling a disk with 100 cracked games with a self created game manager and previews all nicely presented, for those who don't know how to download pirated stuff themselves - and we know that's a high number of people. Don't hate them for not being techy. Don't hate me for wanting just a couple games. Put on a good melody and let's all sing."
,Harry Q Hammer,2008-07-17T19:24Z,"Hey, there's nothing wrong with being a noob, as someone above said, we were all a noob once.

But when noobs start spouting opinionated, nasty shit regarding things they know nothing about, that's when things get crazy!

And BTW, screamo1337, I only uploaded the Gilmore Girls torrent on TPB for completeness as I wanted to keep it active far and wide.  I upload regularly on Demonoid and Mininova, so I guess I can say shit about uploading!"
,Harry Q Hammer,2008-07-17T19:29Z,"P.S.  atlantisisdead, your post was excellent!  You have a great sense of humour!"
,thenite,2008-07-19T15:19Z,"OK,, are there any viruses our Not? "
,yza,2008-08-05T14:34Z,"HI, excuse my english, i'm french.  So, i always install the MGP3 but i don't know how install this torrent.  Please, help me."
,Sushibot5000,2008-08-16T20:39Z,"Seed this, please!"
,Fireholder,2008-08-23T01:01Z,"People split large files into parts because the internet HATES HUGE FILES. It has a difficult time handling large files, that is because everything is sent in tiny things called PACKETS.
That was one of the reasons Bittorrent was created in the first place, for large file transfers. Tiny pieces from many sources, compiled into the main file once received. Do some research before you spout off about things you don't understand. If you are one of those who are able to learn, yet choose not to, you're my definition of STUPID. Rarring (archiving/compressing) a large file or number of files helps with this. First, it compresses it so the file transfer is much smaller in size compared to when uncompressed. A MAJOR benefit for those of us whose ISPs cap their services. Second, you can split a large volume into parts, like this torrent is. It's a benefit, not a bad thing. Have some patience, learn how to use a file archive program (WinZip, WinRAR, 7z etc...)
This torrent can be uncompressed by right-clicking it, choosing WinRAR from the menu, and Extract Here. 
I'm capped at 95 GB/month. Downloading and sharing to at least 3.0 ratio puts that up rather quickly. I always appreciate uploaders who take the time to compress their shares. I'd much rather have that much less toward my cap and spend 10 minutes to uncompress the files, than have twice the download time and transfer amount. :D

P.S. ALWAYS UPDATE YOUR ANTIVIRUS PROGRAM AND SCAN EVERYTHING YOU DOWNLOAD BEFORE DOING ANYTHING WITH IT. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN THE SOURCE AND YOUR COMPUTER.

Thanks, nightwolf and ciao for now, folks :)"
,dumitru florin,2008-08-24T16:47Z,The games are ripped :((

It doesnt show until you mount it or burn it..

So download on your own risk"
,Captain_Share,2009-03-19T02:08Z,"@Krutok: Do you even know what a crack is? oO And if you know abotu that, then you also would know that cracks is often discovered by many anti virus programs and such, as it where a virus.. If you dont, i will recommend something for you: Stay away from torrents -_- I have donwloaded every MGP before and never run into any virus, spyware, adware or any other malicious programs..
