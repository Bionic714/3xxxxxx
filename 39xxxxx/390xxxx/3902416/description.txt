THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. 123 Brain-Killer Affair

Thrush poisons Mr. Waverly, with plans to subject him to a procedure that affects the brain. The criminal organization has already experimented on others, turning a shipping magnate and a diplomat into failures.

(This was one of the earliest filmed episodes. Note that NS's gun isn't the UNCLE Special that would become common in the second half of the season. Elsa Lancaster, who once played the Bride of Frankenstein, dons similar makeup as Thrush's Dr. Agnes Dabree. Yvonne Craig appears as the innocent and can she scream. Abraham Sofer plays one of Waverly's fellow members of Section One who jets from India to New York when Waverly is poisoned. Taut Archie Tegland script and James Goldstone direction move story at a brisk pace. Ending sets up a sequel that, unfortuately, would never be produced. )
