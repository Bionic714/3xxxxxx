This is Mint - just about to DL.  Want higher bitrate, but beggars can't be choosers.  If you like the Music - DL the show, just finished that, My Flattie, 6 years my Junior (never heard of the Show) was amazed by it and got me to set up so he could watch it all.

Great music - GREATEST Show.

P.S. bit of a bummer is that ÂŠ takes all original Music out of the DVD Version (rips) but still an Awesome Show - Much Better than China Beach"
