BBC 2 This World~ Chavez- Trillion Dollar Revolutionary 2007 11 19 avi 

This month Venezuela votes on constitutional amendments which could make Hugo Chavez dictator for life. Are objections to his rule because of his power and Marxist ideology or true despair for the death of democracy?  Is what he?s doing a greater good or formula for disaster?  Independent reports suggest that transparency is dying and corruption rampant in this oil-rich but poverty-ridden country. 

President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela calls the United States 'Dracula' and George W Bush 'Mr Danger', 'a drunk' and 'a donkey'. He can get away with being rude to the most powerful man on earth because his country sits on trillions of dollars worth of oil. Chavez boasts that he is spending his oil bonanza on the poor but others see the money as an instrument of tyranny. Reporter John Sweeney interviews Chavez.
