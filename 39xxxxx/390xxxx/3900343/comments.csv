,JabaDabaBaba,2010-03-05T19:26Z,Great game just can't find the update because some of the spells in the game vanish for no reason when saving and restoring. If any1 has a compadible v1.05 update install for this version or if this original was purchased from Basailisk and have the Plimus order number we can get the better updated version or if someone simply updates a better version.
