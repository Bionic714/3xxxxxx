,85peter,2007-11-27T14:52Z,"we are stuck at 99.9%
please give us the remaining 0.1%"
,Garfio74,2007-11-28T03:36Z,"I donÂ´t know whatÂ´s the problem, I never stop seeding, and no on finish the download, all stuck in 99.9...."
,wwtravlr,2007-11-28T05:33Z,Perhaps the torrent itself is delective.  The only file that is not complete is VTS_03_1.VOB.  Perhaps you could seed that one file on a seperate torrent.  Thanks !
,Deathchaoz,2007-11-30T22:38Z,Could you try putting the VTS_03_1.VOB in a seperate torrent?  Thank you.
,wwtravlr,2007-12-05T03:33Z,"Apparently, our Uploader - Garfio74 - has abandoned us.  I have seen this type of behavior  before - often on Demonoid and Oink (May they rest in Peace).  I guess people like Garfio74 have plenty of time (and bandwidth) to waste, and they enjoy watching others waste their time.

In the future, I will avoid any torrents from Garfio74."
