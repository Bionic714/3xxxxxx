-=SUMMONER 1=-
After hours of searching for this game I could only find one torrent for it that was alive, and that was on the Demonoid. Thanks to the CRIA threatening their hosts they have had to take the site down, as a result of which all torrents originating from Demonoid are no longer working. This upload is to make Summoner available to the torrent community once more.

-=INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE=-
Download with any bit torrent client, uTorrent recommended. Mount Summoner_01.nrg using Daemon Tools and follow the installation instructions, mounting Summoner_02.nrg in place of the other image file when prompted.
As an alternative to mounting images in Daemon Tools you may wish to burn them to CD using your favorite CD/DVD writing software. The game should still run fine using physical discs instead of image files, but do please test them before deleting the files.
Once installation is complete it is important to patch the game, the launcher includes an automated facility for this. I do no want to hear support requests for unpatched copies.
Summoner 1 will run only when Summoner_01.nrg is mounted in Daemon Tools, or a physical copy of it is in one of your CD/DVD drives. If you wish to run it without the image mounted then go to Game Copy World and find a fixed exe file there.

-=DISCLAIMER=-
I am uploading this purely because it is an old game and no longer in production, therefore it is hard to find. If you like the game and do happen to find a copy then please buy it.

-=MISC=-
Summoner.JPG is simply a screenshot of the game's main menu. Also, please ensure that you seed up to at least a 1/1 ratio. Most torrent programs will do this automatically once download is complete up to a 1.5/1 ratio or until you stop them, and it helps keep the torrent scene alive. Thank you.
