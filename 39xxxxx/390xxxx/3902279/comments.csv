,Sanicle,2007-11-26T18:27Z,"Just a little note. Hate messages or fraudulent virus/trojan/malware claims WILL result in the removal of this torrent. I have already taken down another one which has been tested clean in multiple anti virus programs for these reasons

-=Sanicle=-"
,grable,2008-01-07T21:30Z,Thanks for this man =)
,Sanicle,2008-01-14T02:03Z,you're welcome :)
,jatamogue,2008-02-14T00:31Z,"Yoh Sanicle! I'm a newbie. I just would like to ask about seeding and how it is done? Is there a program to use? Can you do it on bitlord 1.1? I hate dead torrents, as a way of saying thanks, I would like to learn the proper way of donating to back.
The proper way or the way you have been doing it."
,Sanicle,2008-02-20T02:38Z,"Hi jatamogue. By default most torrent programs (including bitlord) will seed automatically when you are done downloading. If you have stopped the torrent since it finished downloading then start it again, and it will seed on its own. If you have removed the torrent from bitlord, then save it to the same location as you did before. It will detect that it has been downloaded before, check to make sure that the files are correct, and then start seeding on its own. In short, if you are done torrenting a file then it will seed until you either tell it to stop, or remove it from your torrent list. I hope this answers your question :)"
,Sanicle,2008-03-21T12:56Z,"I just want to say thanks to you guys. Your downloads have pushed this torrent to the number one spot out of over 64,000 when googling ""summoner 1 torrent"" :)"
,Raethe,2008-04-15T06:44Z,"Ooh thankyou for the upload!  I will seed up to roughly 15 or 20 once I can, as I generally always do with torrents.

God I haven't played this game in forever"
,Sanicle,2008-04-23T15:45Z,you're welcome for the upload. thanks for supporting the rest of the torrenting community :)
,Exile86,2008-05-03T09:34Z,I have been searching for this in over a year. I really cant thank you enough for sharing it.
,Sanicle,2008-05-07T17:20Z,you're welcome
,darkrazor100,2008-05-18T12:52Z,"great torrent. ive been waiting to play this since my ps2 broke. one problem though, i cant enter a room in iona where you meet rosaland."

,Nickynicky47,2008-08-06T17:55Z,seed
,Sanicle,2008-08-26T22:04Z,"Nickynicky47: as long as there are assholes like you on the internet I will keep saying this - YOU'RE. GETTING. IT. FOR. FREE! Stop complaining, be patient and be fucking grateful that ANYONE bothers to seed for your stinking ass at all! Apologies if anyone reading this is offended (with the exception of the person this is targeted at) but I'm getting pretty fucking sick of ungrateful bitches around here. Have some fucking respect and realise when you're being given a gift."
,zzenn,2008-09-14T16:31Z,Thanks Sanicle! I was looking for this game after reading some good reviews. Don't worry about the ungratefuls. Plenty of people appreciate when stuff is made available. Perhaps they're just not as vocal :)
,Sanicle,2008-09-16T03:10Z,"Thanks for the support zzenn, enjoy the game :)"
,Akr1D,2008-09-16T05:41Z,"Thanks a ton for uploading this, but I have a problem. As far as I can tell, the game works fine, except, every fifteen or so minutes, it crashes. I'm willing to bet that If I took a stopwatch to it, it would be the same everytime. The auto-updater didn't work for me for whatever reason, but I updated to v1.40 manually, which is as far as I can tell the current version. Please, any suggestions? I am loathe to play the game if I have to restart every fifteen minutes."
,Sanicle,2008-09-16T12:18Z,have you tried running the game in compatability mode? if not then you should try compatability mode for windows 98 and see if the situation improves. If this doesn't help then I'm afraid it's very likely that the problem is either related to hardware or the version of direct X you're using as a lot of support for older games has been dropped in modern graphics cards.
,Akr1D,2008-09-16T17:49Z,"No such luck. In fact, it's starting to freeze in a specific place now, namely leaving the Lenele palace. Ah, well. I think Ill just buy it again, along with the second one, probably only 20-30 bucks total by now anyway. Thanks anyway. Ill seed 2:1."
,amuletts,2008-09-21T18:20Z,"Hi, thanks for uploading this.  I have a little problem however, I can't enter any interiors in iona, preventing me from advancing with the game.  
Now I tryed 'updating' Summoner, and it failed.  I also tried patching it manually.  No joy."
,buckyboy76,2008-12-09T01:26Z,TY for the upload i will seed this for a long time its a great game and since i only seed 1 at a time i can upload at like 200kbs so we can keep it alive 
,Sanicle,2008-12-16T17:56Z,"thanks for the support, it's good to know people are still liking my work :)"
,Rossick,2008-12-31T15:54Z,Thanks man good download easy install I LOVE YOU Sanicle LOL i lost this game when my old comp got messed up so you've saved me haha cheers man=]
,Rossick,2008-12-31T15:54Z,PS will deffo seed 2:1 :)
,Rossick,2009-01-04T22:39Z,jus a quick question is there any particular reason why the game suddenly crashes its done it a couple of times now would appreciate any help!
,Sanicle,2009-01-12T13:23Z,"I can't give a definitive answer, but it's most likely due to your graphics drivers. both ati and Nvidia have been slowly phasing out support for older games, especially with their direct-x  10 cards. Also, the automatic patching system you can access via the game's launcher is now dead. I will see if I can find the standalone patch and post it as a separate torrent... at some point."
,3Drill,2009-04-17T13:47Z,"may you be blessed my man, you can't imagine how much i love this game! jeebus christ, it's like recalling my whole childhood from the dead! Thank you, thank you man!"

,aramadis,2009-12-30T07:43Z,er....im a new member guys and i just wanted 2 know wether this is a good game or not 
,squigglesklok,2010-04-07T02:51Z,"Wow! I have the PS2 version but prefer the PC one, thanks buddy! A question if you can answer, did they do a PC version of Summoner 2?"
,pukol,2010-08-01T07:09Z,"Auto-Updater doesn't seem to work for me, Operation timed out every time. You wouldn't happen to know of a site that has patches also what is the latest Version?"
,unh0ly51nn3r,2010-10-08T07:27Z,Can anyone please seed it? Need to download this game because I'm dying want to play this game... Thanks...

,Foxy246,2011-04-05T15:10Z,hey guys im new to the seeding part so just wondering how you actualy do it then i will seed
,domacleod,2011-06-28T15:50Z,"Seeding is automated.
As soon as you've downloaded as much as 1 mb of a torrent, if there's a leecher that has just started, you'll automatically seed him (unless you're seeding to too many people at the same time)
Just keep your torrent program open and you'll be seeding."
,dragonzer0,2011-06-29T19:39Z,"Need seeders please. At 73% and all of a sudden no seeders or leechers.
Thanks"
