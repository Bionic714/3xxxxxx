,Righteous_Jude_of_CA,2007-11-22T04:06Z,Any comments from anyone about this torrent? Please post.
,AngelGrrl,2007-11-22T08:06Z,"Great torrent! The 320kbps MP3 files in this torrent sound amazing and the WAVs are also very good. I also downloaded the WAV files so I can make my own CD's for my friends. Overall, this torrent of the new Eagles CD is perfect for any Rock music fan. This is definitely the best torrent I could find for this new Eagles CD. Five stars!"
,SpeedRacerFan,2007-11-22T11:31Z,"This surely is the best torrent for the Eagles CD Long Road Out Of Eden. Yes, the files are larger in size than the files in some other Eagles torrents, but the sound quality of the 320k MP3s and WAVs in this torrent are outstanding. The sound is really very hi-fi and much above average. No distortion or clipping of any kind. Good job on this torrent, my thanks go out to Righteous_Jude_of_California!"
,DeutscherAmerikaner,2007-11-22T19:10Z,Thanks very much for this. Wonderful quality. Happy Thanksgiving to all.
