 Robbie Williams - Live at the Albert  

'To sing these songs in a place like this has always been a dream for me. Thank you for making my dream come true.'

Robbie Williams live at the Royal Albert Hall was recorded on 10th October 2001 and is mixed in 5.1 Surround sound.

Experience the triumphs, the tears, the traumas and the trousers when Robert Peter Williams blows into London Town for one night only. Rub shoulder pads with a star-studded audience as Mr. Success and his 58 piece orchestra serenade you with the songs that make the young girls crazy. Rock with Robbie to the big band sound, shake a tail-feather to the finger-poppin', foot-stompin', thigh-pummellin' beat, 'cos tonight we're gonna party like it's 1959!

Robbie Williams - he came, he saw, he swung.


UNSEEN BACKSTAGE AND AFTERSHOW FOOTAGE
With characteristic generosity, Robbie has not only included the show in its entirety, but stacks of backstage footage before and after the concert. Fans and stars alike share their view on the Robbie phenomenon while the man himself announces, in no uncertain terms, his intention to tear the roof off the Royal Albert Hall.

WELL SWUNG
In addition to this perfectly proportioned package, there is also a documentary on the making on Swing When You're Winning, filmed in Los Angeles this summer, plus many more intimate, unmissable moments with Britain's very own King of Swing.
