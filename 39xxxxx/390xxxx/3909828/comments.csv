I verified the MD5 of the ISO several times and it matched up every time.

But I've burnt 2 DVD's using both Nero and ImgBurn, and they both tell me there's a missing .plist file or some random file in the middle of the installation, like a language file or something.

And when I mount the image in Daemon Tools, MacDrive tells me that the volume is corrupt but it can read other HFS+ volumes just fine, including other OSX DVD images."
,Qym,2007-12-18T18:49Z,"******** YOU ARE ALL NOOBS!!!!!!    *******

Iv been reading through a lot of these comments only to be surprised by the fact you all think you need DVD DL disks to install this version of leopard, well you don?t.

Have you ever heard of an ipod? How many of you have an ipod or a mass storage device. All of you I bet. This is a SIMPLE guide written by me on how to install this onto your Mac via an ipod or mass storage device!

1) Plug in your ipod or mass storage device via FIREWIRE (must be able to store more than 6.56gb durh)

2) Go into a little application called disk utility (found in the utilities folder in your applications)

3) Click on your ipod or mass storage device in disk utility shown in the left column, go to the erase tab and call it      Mac OS X Leopard Install DVD and erase it (any journal neither matter)

4) Now mount (double click) the leopard disk image that you illegally downloaded.

5) You should now see the mounted Mac OS X Leopard Install DVD in the disk utility. Return to the erased ipod and click the restore tab. drag the image of leopard to the 'source' section. Drag the erased ipod or erased drive to the 'destination'. DONT click 'erase destination'. Hit restore. Leopard will now copy to your drive. It may take up to 15 minutes so make yourself a cuppa tea and have a little rest.

6) Go into system preferences and click 'startup disk' you should see your current OS and a folder that says Mac OS X 10.5 ...etc. select it and hit restart. It will restart into the installer, now install .The installation will happen faster than via a disk because of the direct firewire connection.  I really hope this helps some of you out there. Spread this about on forums if you want, try and help others.

And you were right about the MD5, I thought I'd seen one but no. Anyway, I ran winMd5Sum on the extracted ISO and got 
9fa4a7e1726757b958ce8da3a6fe8187

But as I've posted before on here, I wouldn't really mess around with this one too long, it doesn't install the bootloader (at least for me) properly, so once its installed, it doesn't boot unless you've got another bootloader from an earlier install pointed to it.

when your at that screen where you need to select the drive to put it on, go up to the top of the screen, and I think click on tools or programs or something and theres an option to open up ""disk manager"" or something like that.

Once in there, you can select your disk, and choose to erase it and format it with mac (journaled) extended. once thats done, close the disk manager program and you'll go back to the install screen. Once there, your disk will show up.

Good luck!"

It's also s-l-o-w (3+ hours to install) and hung at 4 minutes remaining. I let it sit overnight and then just cycled power. It came back up and is sitting in the Finder (after the initial reg process).

Obvious now why Macs cost more; without quality hardware to run it on, this is slow.

However, it -is- running on something other than a Mac so, like the dancing mule, the wonder is not how well it dances but that it dances at all.

2) No internet - Doesn't recognize my gigabit 10/100 ethernet card
3) Video Card doesn't seem to be working properly I only have 1 resolution option and its really low - I have a 256MB ATI RadeonX 1650 card.

More info
I have a 64 bit AMD processor
Asus motherboard
I have looked into the whole kext file thing, but am unsure what exactly how to install them. Do I just drag kext's to the /System/Library/Extensions/ directory and reboot for them to take effect?

One more question
I had windows installed on the drive, I then made a small partition on the drive for leopard. I'm just wondering how I can boot back into windows if I want to. It does't seem to ask me about that other partition where windows is located. Any ideas? Also, how come I have to have the install cd in to boot into Leopard?

,Clark971,2008-04-06T02:03Z,"I don't know if this message will help. Here are every problems I met.

I had an AMD machine but I bought an Intel one (Laptop Toshiba P200-1JZ), and I was really surprised when I saw the installer was working without any -x -v...

Maybe your driver (SATA) won't be recognize, or only a part will be recognize. You need to go in Windows press Windows + R and run ""diskpart"". Type ""list disk"". If the HD where you need to install it is disk0 type ""select disk 0"". After type ""list partition"" and you should see the partitions already present in the disk where you want to install Leopard. If it's not the case, you probably chose the wrong disk, be careful ! Type ""create partition primary size=25600 id=af"" The size is in MB. SizeinGB x 1024 = SizeinMB. Now you're partition should be recognized in DiskUtility, just erase it, Mac OS Extended (Journaled).

Now you can install it, be patient it took 20 minutes for me. (Watch a manga during the installation ^^)

If you have Windows Vista and its bootloader, boot into it download EasyBCD install and open it. Now add a new entry Mac OS X Platform : Generic x86 PC and the name you can remove ""NST"" in front of ""Mac OS X"" and ""Add entry"". Now you can boot into Mac OS X in Windows bootloader.

First boot, first surprise : Before You Begin... There is no keyboard connected to your computer. Please connect your keyboard. Keyboard and touchpad didn't work at all. I didn't understand because in the installer they were working. But I could fix it after hours searching on Google. So you need an USB keyboard and mouse temporaly. Download ApplePS2Controller.kext, copy it in /System/Library/Extensions (to force it click Authenticate enter your account password and OK) ; (don't care about the message saying extension couldn't be load if there is any, just click OK)

Now you need to activate the root account, it's very important. Go to your HD and then Applications/Utilities. Open Directory Utility. Click the lock in the Directory Utility window. 
Enter an administrator account name and password, then click OK. Choose Enable Root User from the Edit menu and enter the root password you wish to use in both the Password and Verify fields, then click OK.

Let's continue, open Terminal into Applications/Utilities and type :
su  (press enter)
Enter your root password and press enter (when you'll enter your password, nothing will happen, it's normal just type it and press enter).
Now, you're a super user be careful ! Type :

sudo chmod -R -755 /System/Library/Extensions/ApplePS2Controller.kext  (press enter)
sudo chown -R root:wheel /System/Library/Extensions/ApplePS2Controller.kext  (press enter)
kextload /System/Library/Extensions/ApplePS2Controller.kext  (press enter)
kextcache -k /System/Library/Extensions/  (press enter)
sudo diskutil repairPermissions /  (press enter)
Be patient for this step, it will take 4 minutes maxi.
Reboot.
Now it's OK, your keyboard and touchpad work perfectly.


About the sound, I have Intel High Definition Audio. Just install Azalia.pkg, this time it's automatic and when you reboot it's good !


Now the WiFi : If you have Intel integrated WiFi card you have to search in Google 

""iwi3945"" or ""iwi4965"" depending of your card. Mine, 4965 doesn't work. But it's not definitive.

,Poison54321,2011-07-24T13:35Z,"I've maganged to install this on an IDE drive (the SATA drivers did not work)using Motherboard ASUS M2N MX SE Plus, however, after hours ands hours and more hours i never managed to get either graphics drivers (Nvidia Geforce 9600GT) nor sound (Creative Sound Blaster X-FI Fata1ty) to work. The OS was either too old (and updating it caused a kernel panic), or the kextes simply did not work.

This is however the first out of 3-4 distros that i have sucessfully managed to boot, so i will have to give you credit for making a good sucsessful distro.

To everyone who is downloading this, i'd reccomend searching if there are any compatible drivers for you hardware before downloading this."

-THIS IS ABOUT THE BEST DAMN DISTRO YOU CAN FIND FOR AMD SYSTEMS; I EVEN BOOT INTEL SYSTEMS WITH THIS DISC. MY GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD3 MOTHERBOARD HAS THE AMD 9XX SERIES CHIPSET.
-CURRENTLY, THERE ISN'T A KEXT FOR AMD'S NEWEST ACHI/RAID CONTROLLER. (IT'S NOT THAT GREAT ANYWAYS; IT HAS TERRIBLE SATA SPEEDS EVEN WITH LATEST WINDOWS DRIVER)
-TO BOOT THE INSTALL YOU HAVE TO PUT ONE HARDDRIVE ON SATA PORT 4 AND ONE DVD/BDROM DRIVE ON SATA PORT 5 WHICH ARE THE LEGACY IDE PORTS. MAKE SURE IN THE BIOS YOU SET THE SATA CONTROLLER TO ACHI MODE WITH PORTS 4/5 IN IDE MODE. -YOU CAN ALSO BUY A SEPARATE SAS/SATA CONTROLLER THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH OSX, OR MOVE THE OSX DRIVE TO THE SECONDARY MARVELL CONTROLLER.
- KERNEL FLAGS = -V CPUS=? BUSRATIO=20 -F (WORKS GOOD FOR ME ON MOST SYSTEMS)"
