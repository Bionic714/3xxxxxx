AVG sucks get another one that knows what to look for . as for the dude wanting a key. look at the damn links pple submitted in these comments"
,brianxxx,2007-12-28T04:58Z,"Norton 2008 detects this is a trojan, Kaspersky does too. So does McAfee. Sorry."
,pstterminator4,2008-01-12T18:14Z,"Alot of waffle here;
has any one confirmed if it works? and what trojan type virus is detected?"
,predict00,2008-02-16T11:13Z,TROJAN dont download this file.  Even thow some of them said its not it is.
,koppoken,2008-03-19T14:06Z,Trojan according to NOD32.
,JesperEngstr0m,2008-03-28T11:23Z,TROJAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! USE CD KEY IN COMMENTS INSTEAD
,r3loader,2008-03-31T11:05Z,hmm Avast! find trojan in this key-gen... i hope the keys writen in komment is working :)
,ivoleko,2008-05-15T16:16Z,"no trojan, no virus here
NOD, Norton and Avast are crap
Use BitDefender.  It is best for scanning crack files."
,thexboy_8,2008-07-05T15:15Z,"@ivoleko 

Wow, BitDefender detected Trojan too! Check the results yourself:

http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/f1fbe26b1964111c183124a0c2f1a0e8

24/33 (72.73%) of the AV's scanned as virus/Trojan."
,Plus18,2008-07-10T08:41Z,"Oh for Christ's sake.
All of you people bitching that it's a trojan have never downloaded any keygens before.
How about... If you're so scared about it, you go get your keygens somewhere else?
Good luck finding one that passes your rigorous tests ;)"
,rmzalbar,2008-07-13T08:24Z,"The trojan reports people keep posting are not a problem.

People who know the skinny on PUP and heuristic-based false detections won't be deterred.

Those who are deterred are the AOLers of the warez world. Those people don't matter.

,Rushz0rz,2008-07-25T04:44Z,"this really makes me sad, people still flagging keygens as trojans even tho they work the same way

Webwasher-Gateway 	6.6.2 	2008.07.05 	Heuristic.Crypted

Heuristic you see it? 99% of keygens or cracks WILL have that on it and 87% will have be marked by trojans! give it a rest, dont need to bitch about it, dont like it dont download it, even better BUY THE GAME!"
,Xzontar,2008-08-11T06:16Z,"Ok guys, if you are too scared to download the dumb file, use the keys the others provided. They work fine, I tested some."
,Sror3d,2008-08-18T21:21Z,"I didn't download but I got the cd keys from comments :D

,Sesshru,2008-10-06T00:47Z,"contains a virus

NOD32 will not let me open the file

torrent is bad!!!"
,xenover,2008-10-26T01:41Z,"Yes, a lot of Anti-Viruses detect ( false alarms actually ) Win32/Trojan as the keygen, but it's not. You can safely add the keygen to exclusions in your antivirus. :)
(Don't be alarmed because the keygen exe has no icon, it still works and is 100 % virus/adware/spyware free.)"
,krupkiller,2008-10-26T19:02Z,5kb...?
,llX.Rayll,2008-10-29T13:29Z,"Works great, thanks!"
,llX.Rayll,2008-10-29T13:35Z,"Use a keyremover (use google, like the one from FaNtAsY) if you entered a serial someone else is using. (You will get a connection failure when trying multiplayer)

And use this keygen to make a more unique serial!

Good Luck"
,hellohello11,2008-11-02T19:45Z,where do you use the key in
,wayne3d,2008-11-09T04:13Z,"Torrent is great, worked like a charm. 

This is actually the first Crack/Keygen that has showed up as a virus or otherwise under a Norton 360 scan. Listed it as Trojan.Linkoptimizer.B but has not effected my system. Chances are it is just a false positive, most seem to be. 

Thanks for the upload Christley"
