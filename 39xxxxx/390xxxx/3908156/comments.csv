,findermix,2007-11-25T17:42Z,"No have virus in Mac, dont be stupid Flash, how many have you tested?. antivirus wind? puafff"
,hockpooh,2007-11-25T17:52Z,"There is no virus, that's bullshit. This update was downloaded from Smith Micro Software's website, the makers of the app. I already had version 12. I'm sorry, I thought that everyone would be updated. You can get updates to version 12 on this site then use this to go to 12.0.1

This is a Mac app and we all have Macs, so no viruses, not sure what  FlashG was trying to prove."

,hockpooh,2007-11-27T21:08Z,Pay no attention to phoenixmac as he is spamming this web page www.appletribu.com all over that's not even in english nor is it any help in any way. It might even be a damgerous web site to visit.
,hockpooh,2007-11-27T22:33Z,".bz2 is a Linux archive, maybe this will open it http://www.zipzag.com/"

,floydiology,2007-12-19T01:35Z,what a bunch of freakin dorks
,m_atte,2007-12-19T21:30Z,How fuckin stupid can you be to upload an archiver -app packed so u need that very app just to unpack it...? omg douche bag
,hockpooh,2007-12-22T02:42Z,"How stupid are you not to know that you have to archive a torrent file or it gets corrupted when downloading and is useless.

How dumb are you not to go to versiontracker.com and download the FREE Stuffit Expander to open this file.

How dumb are you not to get earlier versions off this web site then upgrade to 12.0.1

Now don't you feel dumb for leaving such a dumb comment. Self Education is the key to everything in life. Research before spewing."
,domientius,2008-01-03T10:19Z,don't download this torrent. It was uploaded by a cocksucking white supremacist piece of shit.
,hockpooh,2008-01-03T22:36Z,"Me a Racist ???, what wall are you bouncing off of young fellow. I'm an old Hippie. We love everyone. Maybe you need some professional help. Stop sniffing glue and spray paint might help."
,jd,2008-01-04T17:53Z,"Don't you just love it when people are so nice to each other and thank each other for taking the time to make torrent postings etc etc...
Me, I'm going to have a look and see if this will solve a problem I have and whether it does or not I shall still be happy that someone took time out to make this available.
Cheers Hockpooh"
