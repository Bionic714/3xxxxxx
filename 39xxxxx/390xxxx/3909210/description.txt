In this Movie we explore the psyche, physicality, and fortunes of a 
man whose true nature may never be wholly revealed. The mysterious and 
charismatic Russian-born Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen) is a driver 
for one of London?s most notorious organized crime families of Eastern 
European origin. The family itself is part of the Vory V Zakone criminal brotherhood.

Headed by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), whose courtly charm as
the welcoming proprietor of the plush Trans-Siberian restaurant impeccably masks cold and brutal darkness. 

The family?s fortunes are tested by Semyon?s volatile son, Kirill (Vincent Cassel), who is more tightly bound to Nikolai than his own father. But Nikolai?s carefully maintained existence is jarred once he crosses paths at Christmas time with Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts), a midwife at a North London hospital. 

Tightly plotted, efficient, and never exploitive, Eastern Promises is a compelling thriller, with powerful performances, from a highly acclaimed cast. 


Cast: Naomi Watts, Viggo Mortensen, Vincent Cassel, Armin Mueller-Stahl.
