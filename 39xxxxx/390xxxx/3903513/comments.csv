,death734,2008-02-06T23:56Z,an x264 re-encode of the episode that looks better then that xvid asd stuff (which is about the same file size) but its only 330-350kbps video so obviously not as good as the 350mb rip but great if you are concerned about bandwidth or just looking for avg quality with out taking up to much space
