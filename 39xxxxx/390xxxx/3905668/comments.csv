,Gandalf4i,2007-12-02T20:40Z,"I remade some of them into ""normal 4,5GB"" DVDs and some I split into two. I had some serious problems getting the menus to work properly either way.

Usuallay nothing happened when I started the DVD, but every now and then it worked. Once I got the games/movies started it worked just fine so I think there is something with the menues.

I will try to extract the contents only and get rid of the menues (or build my own menues) to see how that works."
