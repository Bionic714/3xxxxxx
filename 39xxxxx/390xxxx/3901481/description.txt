Complete to-date collection of www.vgcats.com webcomics.

Basically VG Cats, or Videogame Cats, is a webcomic about videogames along the lines of Penny Arcade. Though the last year or two I've tried to focus the comic towards Video Games parodies rather than two gamers. And totally random stuff when I'm bored.

Which brings me to the first thing you probably noticed, those guys are cats! Based off my own kitties (in name only :B). They are;Leo the grey guy and Aeris the pink one. Also filling out the cast is the spawn of the underworld Krug, and defender of pants Pants Man. As well side characters such as Dr. Hobo, Johnny, Major Payne, and Ternaldo.
