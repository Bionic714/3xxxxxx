Daemonicium was set up by by brothers Venthruel (drums) and Myst (vocals) in April 1996. But first serious music and plans for future crystalized in the year 2000 when the first stabile set of musicians was set up. Then in 2001 the first demo CD "Lord of Moon" was recorded in Altheya studio under the eye of Robert Baum from the band Undish. Music on this CD was a black metal, without keyboards, but full of melody and power, inspired by the classical composers like Musorgsky, Tschaykovsky and Beethoven. This demo CD has a good press, but because lack of musicians we cannot promote it properly to the wide audience. Then in 2003 came keyboardist Hagne, and we started to create music for first full-lenght album. Which was recorded at summer 2004 in Bialystok in HERTZ studio. The album called "Through Time and Death" has a very good press, especialy outside borders of Poland, and Daemonicium has promoted it with a series of gigs in Poland, Germany and Switzerland, with bands like Yattering, Luna ad Noctum, Asgaard, Blood, Naumachia, Elysium and Enter Chaos. This was a succesfull year crowned on the Castle Party Festival in Bolkow, Poland, with the bands like Suicide Commando and Deine Lakaien.
