,geekUSA,2007-11-29T07:53Z,does anyone know a working key
,kathysmith,2007-11-29T18:30Z,"It is fairly obvious that the Kaspersky folks log onto this site, download every key posted, and then blacklist it immediately. At mots, you will get a day or two before it goes bad. So don't expect a good key here anymore. 

Here is an interesting idea: You like this software, maybe this is one to consider buying. Warez are great for trying stuff, but time to buy it if you use it all the time. And no, I do not work for Kaspersky."

,DanLeite,2007-11-30T21:38Z,"Hey kathysmith! Here's a fucking sugestion to U:
How about stop being such a capitalist pig...

if the software companies want us to buy the software they should practice more affordable prices!!

But don't miss understand me i'm for freedom of speech... U can say wathever U want.
In fact here's another thought:
Why don't U go sodomize yourself with a capitalist flag??"
,rub17,2007-12-11T20:40Z,"eej Danleite, why should you have a job if everything was free. Why should you want to make a carrier if everything was free. Do you really thing there would be a good pc's, good cars, many different sorts of clothes if everything was free. Plz come one wake up. Are you a red communist? By the way, capitalism is good for development. You wouldn't have an mp3 player or more than 100 different color screen mobilephones with camera if their was no capitalism and I can go on days with typing in examples of things that won't be developed if there was communism. Haven't you learned from the passed? Maybe you are just lazy and get money from the government because you don't have work and are there people working and paying tax to keep you staying alive. And you are blaming companies  (with hard working who are paying tax to keep you alive) who are paying the workers to feed their family and buy what they need. pff Your opinion just sucks"
