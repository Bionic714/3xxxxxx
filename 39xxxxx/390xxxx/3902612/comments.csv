,stevegad,2009-03-26T00:34Z,"Hey a4ust

When you see multiple Zip or RAR files, just unpack (ie: drag with right mouse button, and drop about 5mm - NOT into a folder, and select 'Extract Here.) 
The installer will be in there, and will unpack the rest as it needs them, as soon as you activate the installer file. OK.
If you can't drag & Drop just right click and select 'Extract here'. Only the FIRST one usually. OK!"
,TruthKnights,2010-02-27T06:52Z,Works fine. Thanks to the uploader. The program is low-quality though. All the templates have been exhausted. No brilliant ideas.
,div24,2010-04-04T14:55Z,what is the password  for extracting the password
