,samsonov14,2008-10-29T04:40Z,I am havin the same problem as scouternorm...except the program won't even start I just get PRE-RELEASE PRODUCT HAS EXPIRED. I installed the crack and autocad.exe according to directions but no workie plz help....thx
,bitSmasher,2008-11-18T10:19Z,"After much hassle and frustration, I've worked this out:

Install program, use supplied serial.
Copy acad and crack .exe's and patch
Copy autocad_2002_pre_release_ex zip from folder within autocad directory and run

then you can use the program.

If you have already had the ""expired"" warning, overwrite the acad.exe and apply the crack patch again, then run the prerelease zip. I've found If you don't start from the start the patching won't work."
,frogleyyy,2009-01-21T22:26Z,"anyone know where to find the 2000s edition?
need the same one we are using at school."
,Calkayne,2010-06-09T16:58Z,"Sorry for trolling, when I run the Crack the following Error Message is called up:
File to be updated or missing:
acdb15.dll
acrx15.dll
acutil.15.dll

ATM when I run the app I still receive the Expiry Message.

Anyone with Ideas?"

,Valpocity,2011-10-19T08:58Z,"Old installation instructions for my â€¦ failed !
1) When prompted enter Codes with license key 400-12345678 / T4ED6P. â€¦ OK
2) Agree 'bitSmasher' Copy Acad and Crack.exe ... then patch ! â€¦ Overwrite Acad before patching ?
3) Extract AutoCAD2k2_Crk.exe from Autocad_2002_Pre_Release_Ex.zip to â€¦ Autocad 2002 directory â€¦ and run it !

AutoCAD 2002 VAP Notes Crack work for me ... but don't touch Crack folder or Zip file embedded !
1. Check 4 files: acad.exe / acdb15.dll / acrx15.dll / acutil15.dll â€¦ files.dll located in C:\ Common Files \ Autodesk Shared \
2. Run AutoCAD 2002 VAP.exe ... find the 4 files and patch in order!
3. Restart OS and run AutoCAD 2002 ... You may receive an Register error â€¦ but then works Ok!
