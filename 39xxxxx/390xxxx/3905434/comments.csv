But what about the other seasons ?
Does anyone have these ?"
,phisher,2007-11-23T15:51Z,"Will be uploading 6 and 7 as time/bw issues permit. my speed sucks donkey balls so it will take quite a while till those appear. 

and please, everyone downloading, keep on seeding as long as possible, so that i can move on with next season set as soon as possible, thus limiting the bw available to this particular torrent."
,sille7990,2007-11-23T18:11Z,Hey har du sæson 3+4 ville jeg blive glad hvis du gad ligge dem op. super upload mange tak
,sille7990,2007-11-23T18:13Z,"do you have X-Files, season 3+4 I will be happy if you will upload them.Thanks a lot for this is a super upload"
,phisher,2007-11-25T02:10Z,"I dont have direct access to them, but i could ask from a friend to supply dvd discs for them if they are available to create images from. They could appear eventually after season 6 and 7 tho, which were requested before tho. So all it takes is patience, and loads of that."
,jerrysenf,2007-12-13T09:03Z,Are croatian subtitles available?
,Nightowl247,2007-12-15T03:32Z,"OK phisher, this torrent is up and running very good now.
You can move on to season 6 and the rest of us will keep seeding season 5 ;o)"

,phisher,2008-10-09T14:45Z,"Force a recheck on torrent client to verify everything. When I originally uploaded the torrent, I did crc check on everything to make sure they were in working state. And no, I dont have the files anymore here, so I cant help seeding on the files anymore."
