Get WinRAR or 7zip to unarchive the ISO then burn it to a DVD or mount it with a software of your choice. After that just open the DVD using windows autoplay"

,jfmherokiller,2010-03-27T03:38Z,"extremely useful tip
=================================
to extract the iso select all the files in 7-zip and press extract all"
,jfmherokiller,2010-03-27T03:54Z,the why to do this is because all the files are a part of the iso disk the the r# files are the iso sectors and the sfv defines the placement of the files by hexadecimal checksum
