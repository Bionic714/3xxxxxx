,Yureka,2007-11-25T12:38Z,Thanks a lot :)
,Yureka,2007-11-26T01:12Z,Cortax you wouldn't happen to have a savegame with all the cgs too? :)
,Cortax,2007-11-26T03:29Z,"Sorry no, I havent had time other then starting it ^^. I uploaded it the moment I got it, so chances are that most seeders have gotten further along then I have. 

A note thu, I play this game on a Laptop, but as I have my 19"" screen plugged in I made it my main display and shut down the laptop screen. 

And what happened is that whenever I exit the game...it shuts down my plug in screen forcing me to restart the puter to get it to work. LOL. No big thing but a warning to any other using a monitor plugged into a laptop."
,Yureka,2007-11-26T21:48Z,ok nevermind I found a save with all the cgs :)

Cheer"
