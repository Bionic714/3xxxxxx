,pether,2007-11-21T09:29Z,A bonus disc.
,meanjulio,2007-11-24T09:48Z,Seed please!
,meanjulio,2007-11-25T03:47Z,"Ok so I was able to burn tactics disks 1-3, but only 1 and 2 worked when i tried to install...Something is wrong with disk three, it's mode is unknown. SO...ya i can only install disks 1 and 2...Anyone know what I should do about disk 3? Maybe I'm just not burning the image properly or under the wrong settings...??"
,Behemothius,2007-11-27T20:45Z,"Why burn when you can mount?:) I just tried mounting it and all looks good. But, if I remember well, you just have to make installation from CD 1, the other two are needed as the story progresses. The game tells you to insert CD 2 or CD 3. Well, I think at least, it was a long time ago since I played the game."
,dttnbguy,2007-11-28T02:40Z,"wow, aren't you the worst seeder in the world, cant you stay connected for more than 2 hours, 82% and its been their for more than a week

,Behemothius,2007-11-28T12:31Z,"@dttnbguy:don't know, dude, I'm connected all day except during the night, can't fall asleep because of the noise the damned computer makes. And, no, I don't have dial up, it's a 2Mbit/s line."
,jessejericho,2007-11-29T13:55Z,How long has this been sitting at 86%?
,Solar_Legend,2007-11-29T14:53Z,so close.  85%.  all i really want is FOT )-:
,Viagrapolice,2007-11-30T03:51Z,stuck at 86 percent.......
,kianbung,2007-11-30T11:18Z,same here. where are all the seeders?
,Behemothius,2007-11-30T20:11Z,"I'm seeding almost all day, but usually at very low upload speeds, around 5kB/s. Is that normal or is something not working as it should?"
,Mournfel,2007-12-01T20:51Z,"If anyone sees this could you please resume seeding, thanks."
,Solar_Legend,2007-12-02T00:15Z,almost.  it hit 95% and stopped.
,exodeus,2007-12-03T11:15Z,"*GRINS*

well... after 1week and 2days, 24/7 activity, and a ratio of 4400% (as in uploaded 154Gb)...

I'm at 97,6% with an average download speed of 0.05kB/s or less.

And all I really wanted was to see what the Radioactive disc was and to test Tactics, since i actually own Fallout 1 and 2 original.

ah well, good upload and I guess that you'll have 92 seeds pretty soon... as in a day or three :D

oh, the remaining 3% is on fallout 1 and 2 so if you want tactics you got it!"
,jessejericho,2007-12-04T17:39Z,"lol... 99.7%

so close"
,pizzapicante27,2008-02-12T05:25Z,"I have a little problem, hope someone can help me, im usin a windows ue and when im trying to install it tells me that my windows doesnt support this game, what can i do? can someone help me?"

,Turkeys1337,2008-03-05T04:21Z,"Hi 

I've tried to install Fallout 1 and so far im encountering the This version of windows is not supported error. I have tried mounting it with Daemon and by the setup.exe and neither one works. How can I get it to be compatible? "
,Turkeys1337,2008-03-05T04:32Z,"Nevermind i've figured it out.

Everyone encountering this problem should go to here to learn how to install Fallout 1 + 2 on XP , Vista or NT.

,Turkeys1337,2008-03-05T04:33Z,Whoops by Vista I meant Windows 2000.... 
,WOOKINATOR,2008-04-18T09:09Z,So... For the tactics ... It keeps saying I need the CD ... and I tried to mount it but theres nothing to mount D:
,hypertensao,2008-04-24T19:52Z,it wont work on xp sp2 :S
,jedii101,2008-04-28T17:49Z,"Thanks Behemothius this game series is -Superior-. I've only played part one before, but it's still one of the best games made to this day. Roll on FO3!


One thing though, what do each of the patches do? are any of them cheats?"
,Shilonus,2008-05-05T23:51Z,Thanks so much for this!
,freezysunshine,2008-06-01T17:47Z,6.7 complete seeed plz
,TotalShogun,2008-06-06T01:08Z,"I've downloaded and now I come to report. 

Fallout Tactics discs and the extra Radioactive disc works like a charm. 

The patch for Tactics (fotpatch1.27) works. The other patches I've never tried as I haven't tested Fallout 2 yet. 

Fallout 1 does not install on my PC because it doesn't support my windows version (Windows XP Home Edition). 

I'll be seeding for a few days to help a bit."
,dandan986,2008-06-06T11:37Z,"Fallout 1/2 may encounter some problems while installing/playing on windows XP (probably even ME/200 and Vista)

This is a good guide for the help with the errors and the installation.

,dandan986,2008-06-06T11:40Z,"One question btw, Fallout Radioactive was released before or after Fallout Tactics?"
,TotalShogun,2008-06-10T12:35Z,"Fallout Tactics
Release Date: March 15, 2001

Fallout Radioactive

Thanks for the information, Dandan986. Hope it helps."
,BiggerHammer,2008-06-11T15:46Z,"FALCHE2 is a ""cheat"" where you can ""improve"" your character but I doubt it that works on FO3. 

There was also a ""mapeditor"" available for FO1 and FO2 downloadable from the black Isle webpage. But as far as I know this page is no longer available.

Again, I dont know if it works on FO3 but I honestly doubt it."
,BiggerHammer,2008-06-11T17:49Z,Character editor for FO3 tactics available at the end of THIS link:  http://www.atomicgamer.com/file.php?id=28730#

,drizzt396,2008-06-23T09:04Z,"I'm struggling with installing Tactics myself, and have found two other instances of my problem online (with no answers to help):

The setup program won't run. From either the autorun menu or double-clicking it myself. It's not a compatibility issue--I've tried running it in multiple modes. The only thing that happens is that Setup.exe pops up in my processes tray and refuses to go away. If anyone knows how I can fix this (or do a manual install) help would be appreciated."
,Arandie,2008-06-29T04:26Z,Seed please!
,Arandie,2008-07-07T04:05Z,"I download and installed everything, so, yeah, all of the games work. Also, I'll be seeding on and off for awhile."
,lt_dan2,2008-07-09T01:27Z,"After the install I planned on using either Daemon Tools or MagicISO to emulate the CD.  Install went fine, but I cant find the image file to mount.  Anyone not burning the cds get the game to work?  Where is the image file?"
,Arandie,2008-07-09T23:58Z,Just use the ISO.
,ShmenonPie,2008-07-18T13:47Z,"For anyone having trouble installing the games, as they're not meant to work on Windows XP, just right click on the Setup file, click on Properties, go to the Compatibility tab, and select run this program in compatibility mode for Windows 95. After it's installed, do the same for the short cut in the start menu."
,Spyke88,2008-07-19T01:36Z,"To you guys stating that Fallout 1/2 doesn't work on XP/Vista, You Are Wrong! I've run them both on XP Home SP2 and Vista Home with little to no problems. So it must be your comps that doesn't support the games. Either your gfx, your drives or something else is causing the problems, but it probably isn't you OS. Just saying."
,Spyke88,2008-07-19T17:54Z,"@BiggerHammer: You stupid motherfucker calling Fallout:Tactics Fallout3, it's not even released yet! Tactics has nothing to do with the actual cRPG-series."
