,M408,2011-06-20T02:07Z,160 is fine what are you talking about..
,gofreemovies,2011-09-07T05:35Z,"160kbps is very acceptable audio quality. Anything higher than 128kbps is very good quality in my opinion.
This is my favorite DJ Quik album of all time. Give the uploader a break!"
,skollatus2,2011-12-26T03:51Z,Jack is correct. 128kbps above is fine but 'pure quality' would denote 320kbps
