,FulciLives,2008-04-26T17:22Z,"I admit that I know nothing about THE KILLERS but I downloaded this FLAC CDRip because of the song entitled ""All These Things That I've Done"" as this song is prominently featured in the 2006 film SOUTHLAND TALES although for some reason it does NOT appear on the CD soundtrack release of SOUTHLAND TALES.

Now because of this bit torrent I have that song. So a big THANK YOU to the person that uploaded this :)"
