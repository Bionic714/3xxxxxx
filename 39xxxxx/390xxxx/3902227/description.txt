UFC 23  -  Ultimate Japan II  -  of "The Dark Years"

The Dark Years are comprosed of UFC 23 to 29, and during that time of turmoil, no UFC shows ever made it to VHS tape, and to this day they have not been reproduced on DVD.

I am lucky enough to have all the Dark Years and hope to upload them all.  Some are a bit flaky in parts as they were recorded from Satellite.  But all are watchable and I love them as I love all UFC Events.

Please Seed !!
