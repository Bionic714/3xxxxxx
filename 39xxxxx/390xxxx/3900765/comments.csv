,x.urbisa,2007-11-20T18:27Z,Please describe the problem more detailed
,kingdom gone,2007-11-23T19:01Z,"RK, make sure you don't have the program open when you're trying the patch"
,SteadyH,2007-12-07T01:37Z,"I patch it, says it works..Then after a few uses of the recorder it begins to say cancelled - demo version.."
,pippsp,2007-12-17T03:32Z,the patch does not work.  Probly because its a patch for version 11 and not 12??????  Im not sure the patch program says version 11 all over it. lololol
,FrIeK,2008-02-02T13:20Z,"Thanks.

worked for me. 
I don't have problems with it.

And the speed is great. Downloaded in just 2 min."
,friend55,2008-03-11T04:07Z,"Successful Instructions.

Make sure to remove any previous installations of WM Recorder.  Install the WMinstall_12 file.  Don't launch the program.  Go to your program files and locate the VM12 folder.  Drag the patch file into that VM12 file....and then run it.  Then launch VM Recorder, and enter the serial found in the serial.txt file.

The patch is for VM 12.......  it works fine."

I downloaded the torrent but there was not a ""serial.txt file"". I did run the patch and it said that it was patched. I am on Vista... any suggestions on a serial?"
,seeder12,2008-04-03T13:01Z,"Sophos Antivirus says the path is a type of ""Adware/Unsuitable Application""

Anybody know more than I do?"
[V],cezen,2008-04-05T02:06Z,"Where is the Serial.txt?  It was not included in the download file or on the Read me file....

but so far it doesn't seem to require one.. I am still finishing install

ok done installing but I can't seem to operate the program, but it's not the torrents fault.. I just don't understand how to use this yet... AHHHHHHHH

So this torrent is primo.. no serial.txt needed"
,JohnD0w,2008-04-22T18:28Z,did you ever think the patch IS a hacktool? why not buy the program if you got no clue about what you're downloading?
,gunnerone58,2008-05-05T20:08Z,"Have Vista, Program and Patch work fine. No Virus that i could find. just make sure when you install the program that you don't run it after install. there will be a check box that you have to undo at the end on install then take the patch and copy it to the directoty folder and apply patch. Start program and enjoy. "
,toofan,2008-05-21T13:07Z,"works great here. I uninstalled earlier version. then isntaleld new one. didnt run it. patched it.

works like a charm.

thanks for this great app!"
,toofan,2008-05-21T13:08Z,I run win xp pro btw. so it works fine on xp :)
,rc71,2008-05-23T00:28Z,"This is NOT 12.  It is WM 11.  Of course it works.  Put if you are looking for the features of 12, it's not there."
,Bosin,2008-06-01T21:13Z,"http://www1.zippyshare.com/v/44319990/file.html
This is a clean crack for WM Recorder 12.
The .exe is called ""WMR11.exe"" because the WM Recorder 12 executable is called ""WMR11.exe"", too."
,nordleo,2008-06-16T00:02Z,"To Bosin
Thank you ;-)"
,maninblacko,2008-06-19T00:44Z,"Hello

I seem to be stuck on 99.9%.
Any one else have this problem?

Cheers"
,slowgenius,2008-07-01T06:55Z,Clamwin says that this download contains the Trojan.Downloader-38876 program.  Nein danke.
,cew006,2008-08-04T11:19Z,Bosin knows best. That fixed .exe works great and is clean. Thanks mate!
,funkouse,2008-08-17T19:58Z,"@slowgenius: It looks like that ClamWin is not that clever :) No trojan...

@_RK_ @pippsp: Copy the WMR12Patch.exe to the directoty folder and apply patch. Start program and enjoy.

@andrews1469: You don't need a serial, read the info..."
,kwest12,2008-08-21T06:54Z,"I used the install from this torrent and the patch from Bosin's post (copied the patch into the WMrecorder folder and overwrote the original exe file and then ran the application by double clicking the pasted patch).  It works for me and I've tried a number of long downloads simultaneously (meaning its not the trial version anymore).  The patch included with this torrent may work too, I just didn't try it.  Thanks for the upload."
,dartb,2008-09-06T01:43Z,"Not bad.  A four minute download.

+ for you."
,RealGenius,2008-11-21T00:12Z,"@Bosin: Thanks, the crack did the trick! Awesome job finding it!"
,dielaughing,2010-01-14T11:56Z,"how many dumb shits are out there in the world? any patch, keygen, serial or whatever the damn crack is ALWAYS comes up as a virus.. it's a problem with the anti-virus softwares.. and it really gets annoying when they go in and clean up all my 'hacktools' (cracks) that I've collected.. the only way to beat that is to burn a back up copy of your program install archive or you can zip it up with winrar.. I just can't believe the amount of people that say, yep.. theres a virus.. you're a virus dickhead!"
,dielaughing,2010-01-14T12:03Z,"and btw, this is the only real working copy of wm recorder out there.. i've been looking high and low for this to not bugger out after a few minutes of recording saying ""your evaluation time has expired, please restart wm recorder to record again"" .. demonoid doesn't even have a working copy.. but you have to apply the patch correctly, otherwise yer burnt.. and if you've 'cleaned' out the download with a anti-virus program, most likely you just deleted the crack that is gonna make the program actually work for more than 2 minutes! get real people. a hacktool is your friend.. not a virus. "
,Mikertones,2010-07-06T03:06Z,"i installed correctly i believe ,patched it right and everything?
but how the fuck do you get this shit to record anything ?wtf i spent hours on this shit and i doesnt pick up nothing ? it doesnt detect nothing?"
,serafim_1,2012-05-13T22:48Z,"Hello! If you want to use a latest version 14.10.2 of this program go to the link -->
