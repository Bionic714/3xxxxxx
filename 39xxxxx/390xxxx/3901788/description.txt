Notes...

This album comprises a classic collection of early recordings by Sally Oldfield with her then 15 year old brother Michael. The music, which was recorded in 1968, serves as a fascinating record of the two Oldfields who have now carved enormously successful individual careers in their own right.

SALLY: vocals and guitar
MIKE: vocals and guitar
TERRY COX: drums, African drums, finger cymbals, tambourine & triangle
RAY WARLEIGH: flute
Music arrangements, for two violins, viola, cello and harpsichord, on "Lady Mary" and "Midsummer Night's Happening" are by David Palmer. 
Produced by Nathan joseph
