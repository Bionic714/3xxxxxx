,palestin,2007-12-19T05:39Z,"thanks for sharing, it's works :)"
,babygodzilla,2007-12-19T19:27Z,"anyone else experiencing bugs with this software?

When in Unity mode, I click on Show Desktop so I can set my resolution. after the Desktop shows up, I right click on it and nothing happens. Left click nothing happens either. this is so annoying."
,ph0bolus,2007-12-23T05:21Z,"I downloaded this for my mac.  I clicked on the .dmg file, and opens up a VMware window with the options Install VMware, Uninstall, and Getting Started.  I dragged Install VMware into applications folder...Clicked it, the icon got bigger like on all macs when you execute something, but that was it..nothing else happened.. How do i install this?!"
,Punks_4_Live,2007-12-29T11:00Z,"So... I'm also a newbie in terminal, but now i figured out how to generate the serial. So for all those who haven't managed it to crack VMware Fusion, here are the instructions how i managed it:

1.) Open Terminal
2.) type in: ""chmod +x""
3.) Drag in the ""keygen_macosx""
4.) Hit Return
4.a.) The keygen_macosx file's suffix changes into ""exec"" (you will see this in the Preview in Finder.)
5.) Again drag the (new) ""keygen_macosx"" into terminal.
6.) Boom! You'll see the serial number of VMware fusion."

,PathDaemon,2008-02-02T00:51Z,"ph0bolus:
That's an installer package. Don't copy it to the computer! Open it from the DMG and it'll copy all the needed files to the computer."
