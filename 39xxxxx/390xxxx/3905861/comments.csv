,ektakrome,2007-12-03T01:32Z,what the hell are WV files...why not just upload it with FLAC or straight up wavs.
,baruch77,2008-04-15T17:24Z,"i tried to type in wmv and it would not open, only prompting quicktime. so sad. i have been trying to download this album for months!"
,mikeycorleone,2008-05-06T11:46Z,"tY! - great up

appreciate the .wv's - much better than .mp3's or .ogg.

.wv is a wavepack file, which is lossless, like FLAC. download foobar2000 to play or convert them to FLAC."

As mikeycorleone - an educated, intelligent sort of fellow has mentioned - it's in a WavePack format. Download the most excellent XRecode (pc only methinks) and convert to any darn format of your particular, high fussy inclination. 320kbps, 2 channel stereo in my case. Sounds fantastic. Thanks to the upper. Superb release. One of the albums of the year."
,TeamPBay,2009-04-18T16:49Z,Thanks for the up.  And for the quality.  Some albums demand to be in as lossless a format as possible.  This is definitely one of them.

Thanks for the suggestion of Xrecode."
