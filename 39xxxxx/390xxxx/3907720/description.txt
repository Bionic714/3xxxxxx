Pink Floyd - Dark Side Of The Moon. Dolby Digital 5.1 audio converted to 448kbs/48khz AC3 from DTS audio. Produced for better PC compatibility, since most soundcards limit SPDIF pass-through to 48khz. Outputting from Sound Blaster Audigy 2 to top-of-the-line Denon Home Theater system, I cannot tell it from the original. Your mileage may vary.
