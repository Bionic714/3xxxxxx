,jeffknight,2007-11-21T00:26Z,"That's because I'm still doing the initial seeding, and my max connections has been reached...  sorry for the troubles, but please understand that my connection isn't really seeding material and the only reason I'm doing this is because there isn't really another copy out there. "
,zohardues,2007-11-21T00:54Z,"Just wondering, thats all. 

Thanks for upping it, and your right, this is the only version up :) "
,tempy8tempy,2007-11-21T01:31Z,Thanks but why are all the numbers messed up? When playing one it suddenly switched to an other song several times per song!
,zohardues,2007-11-21T05:01Z,"Tempy, are you sure your're 100% done with the song your listening to? If your not done 100%, then some of the data gets messed up. Since there is still only one seeder at the moment, I doubt you have full 100% of the torrent done, just wait until its all done and it should sound fine. "
,jeromedevine,2007-11-21T15:20Z,Hey great job buddy! I will start downloading it right away! And the Saga finally finds the end of the journey!
,jeffknight,2007-11-21T21:06Z,"Please remember to seed until your ratio is at least 1.0 (if not 2 or 3)... Since this is the only one out there, we still need seeds."
,jeromedevine,2007-11-22T01:54Z,"Hey for every Lord of the Rings Fan out there! I uploaded a mix of stuff that you might enjoy. It is only 125Mb but you will find it worth your download! It includes the Trilogy Super-Trailer, Movie Parodies found on the US (not found in UK) Extended DVDs, DVD Easter Eggs, DVD Covers, Fonts. You can find this torrent at: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3903531  So Enjoy and keep seeding!"
,darkempire33,2007-11-22T03:55Z,"Is anyone else having the issue of tracks 2.04 and 4.04 not working?  It looks like the data is there and it is recognized as an mp3, but it will not play no matter what you do.  "
,jeromedevine,2007-11-22T07:15Z,"Hey darkempire33. I don't have any problems whatsoever. Everything downloaded fine. And by the way track 2.04 is one of the best that there is so you may decide to redownload again maybe those two tracks. Check however if they have been downloaded 100%. 


Anyway, I downloaded this torrent and it is great to finish off The Complete Recordings of the LOTR soundtrack. If you haven't yet got the first two parts - Fellowship and Two Towers you can get them from here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3894396/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_-_The_Complete_Recordings_[OST]  and if you like them do submit a Thank you note, it would be appreciated."
,jeffknight,2007-11-24T05:43Z,"both 2.04 and 4.04 work fine for me, so I'd do a forced recheck."
,darkempire33,2007-11-25T04:00Z,"I redownloaded them and they work fine.  Great upload, thanks!"
,Ranofer,2007-11-28T02:38Z,"I've been trying to find this forever.  Well, at least since it came out.  So seed it up, and I'll seed forever :)"
,ninjatango,2007-11-30T19:53Z," AWESOME, been waiting for this to be out for years."
,darkvineyard,2007-12-23T21:20Z,"awesome! i will seed for a whole freaking week if i get this! ><
