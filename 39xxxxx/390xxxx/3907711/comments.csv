,Middleton_4,2007-11-29T01:09Z,"Yeh I patched my football manager then followed the readme file. But when I go to load up it says something about font not found.

1. Yes, if you use this skin (tsubie08) then you can take this font for example hence  ""C: \ WINDOWS \ Fonts"" and Change ttf name in t2k, and
 cut here C: \ Documents and Settings \ user name \ My Documents \ Sports Interactive, Football Manager 2008 \ skins \ tsubie \ fonts 
2. Try to unpack through 7zip. The file is not broken, I checked!"
,Middleton_4,2007-11-29T05:10Z,"Hmm, how do you mean with that font thing? I'm meant to take a file from my C:\windows\fonts and copy it to a folder in all the skins? I think it was on black_in2 by the way. But I cant click anything or move hte mouse anywhere without font missing thing. But yeh I'm sure the file is find, got that 7zip thing and getting room to unzip again:p"
