,oblachubs,2007-11-27T05:51Z,ivan9 your concerned?  What an idiot.  I'm glad your not running for office like loser Cliton.
,kplusrd,2007-11-30T09:52Z,"Downloaded, this version is definately watchable. Please remember is a camcorder version, sound a little echo (but is from a cinema!), only released late Nov 07!  Video 6/10 audio 6/10.  Moviebobo, many thanks. "
,spud1984,2007-11-30T11:57Z,"the film has a good story line its a shame about the quality i will give the picture 3/10 due to blured fuzzy and granney affects and i will give the audio 4/10 due to mumbled vocies and the bass line being to overpowing and the download speed was quite slow.............so overall it gets a 3/10

but its a free movie so it worth downloading to see what you think and if you dont like it delete it...................

so thanks loder for a trying it was better than seeing nothing at all... XXxx ALL THE BEST FROM THE UK xxXX "
