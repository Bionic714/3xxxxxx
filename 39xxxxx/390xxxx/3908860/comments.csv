,TigersWin,2007-12-08T08:33Z,"Here's an idea.  You don't like football or any other sport, don't click on the link to it.  DUMBASS.  You must explain to me how I or anybody else ""forces"" it on you when YOU chose to click the link.  However,  I'll continue to release what I want and you can screw yourself. "
