There is more to humanity we are bobarded with, don't let it corrupt your perceptions. Open your mind to the positive in humanity.

Humans are actually a wonderful species dominated by a minority which cause suffering and destruction, not the other way around.

We are not a desease which should become extinct, we are an intelligent species who should thrive as long as we can.

Unfortunately, those who dominate caused visionaries like Tesla to miss their time and so retarded our development and force us as a race to continue the use of fossil fuels and destructive power but had we developed zero point energy early last century the planet wouldn't be as polluted as now and global suffering wouldn't be so prevalent.

We are on the cusp of a new enlightened age, we will not be so destructive for much longer because science has now caught up and we are growing again.

Open your eyes and mind to the positive of our species."

let me guess; you do not live in the united states of amnesia???  would you really want the southern u.s. wankers populating the galaxy like a universal 'jerry springer' television show?

you don't think we are being destructive as a species?  maybe you're in europa, but us humans are literally killing our planet.

i know all about tesla, wrote a ten page paper on him, and have seen his tesla museum in colorado; you're 'preaching to the choir', as it were; or if you don't get it yet, i was being sarcastic when i posted it.  

i will see the 'positive of our species' when we do positive things..."
,nailzbunny,2007-11-28T02:27Z,"Fortunately for the human species the number of short sighted fools like spacey1 are in the minority. DeltaPan, I feel the same way you do and see the awesome power and endless potential of our species as a whole. We are in our infancy stages, like a small child in the ""gimme"" phase. However just like a small child does we will grow out it, only it will takes us centuries instead of a few years to do so. "
,spacey1,2007-12-01T00:49Z,"i guess you two are right...if we do reach out into space and into the galaxy, perhaps those future humans will be less destructive than we are now.  i had just seen some iraq documentaries and was thinking about some american-type imperialistic empire of the future.  also, that was a partial quote from kurt vonnegut; pessimism is dangerous sometimes..."
,FlexnÃ¤s,2008-02-25T22:52Z,"Humanity is a fossil-fueled cancer, eating and killing everything in its way. Do the research, you fucking retards. Soon 7 billions. Soon alone on the planet with nothing left to eat but mass-produced GMO-food. Only good thing is, once we have exterminated ourselves, life will have another chance. We, humanity, is a sad mistake, not ""the crown of creation""."
