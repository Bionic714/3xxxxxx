It was already splitted?"
,Trif,2007-11-20T18:18Z, At last after two days of time waste ! here come a man who knows what he's doin' . thx PPKLP
,DemonWizard,2007-11-20T21:08Z,"What are you talking about Trif? This torrent only proves that the one ixlikextoxdansex (and the splitted version i´ve made of his) released real.

There´s even the same skip on track 13 (encore) at 09:05. (probably it happened on the concert).

This one is better because of the higher bit rate.

Tell me PPKLP, the cd is just one track and you splitted or it was already like this!?

Thanks again for this torrent.

Now i´m waiting for someone to release it in flac! lol"
,mous1,2007-11-20T22:03Z,Thank you for the upload
,PPKLP,2007-11-21T01:08Z,"@DemonWizard:
I ripped it just like this.. Didn't have to split it myself... And if it makes you happy, i'll put it up in flac aswell somewhere this week."
,DemonWizard,2007-11-21T04:51Z,"@PPKLP

Thanks! I'll be very happy! (well, not just me) I'd be nice to have this album in a lossless version.
When i see it in the stores i'll buy it too.

About this rip: My splitting was very much like the original album. That was cool. I tried to follow the way that Coachella bootleg was splitted.

But now i'm only listening to these mp3. :P"
,flipboitamidles,2007-11-21T05:04Z,"idk why, but i have an error when trying to download this

no one got that problem?"
,strafe,2007-11-21T08:26Z,"At least the track listing on this one for CD1 is correct.  Finally, I can download CD2!! (My copy was only 1 CD).  Thankyou."
,PPKLP,2007-11-21T10:39Z,"For all you quality freaks out there (like me and DemonWizard), i've put up a torrent of this in FLAC aswell. It can be found here:

,DemonWizard,2007-11-21T13:13Z,"Holy sh...! That was nice!

Thanks again!"
,mdeadsy,2007-11-22T18:06Z,you kick ass dude! seriously
,instill,2007-11-23T02:46Z,"Track 5 stops at 5:42...it's cut off! It's supposed to last to about 7:28, you can tell the transition into track 6 is messed up."
,instill,2007-11-23T03:16Z,"Nevermind I guess the 7:28 track is from Coachella...I actually like that version better!! Anyways I don't think I can delete my previous comment so sorry dude, thanks for the upload."
,DemonWizard,2007-11-23T13:58Z,"@instill

Track 5 is not from Coachella. This is Alive 2007.

The track from Coachella blends with a sample from Technologic. The track on Alive 2007 blends with Burnin' from the album Homework.

The track is shorter than the one in Coachella because they choose (Daft Punk) to split it when the Around the Word / HBFS part was over. (in the Coachella bootleg the ""Around the World"" vocoder continues in the Technologic part)

Burnin' is a great track!"
,ddust102,2007-11-26T20:00Z,"the last track for some reason does not open for me, could someone up it on a hosting site?  I'd be indebted to your service!"
,DemonWizard,2007-11-27T09:25Z,"@ ddust102

Track 14?

This track is a video. Download a codec pack like CCCP or K-lite and it should play."
,ddust102,2007-11-27T19:29Z,"@ demon wizard-

no, sorry for the confusion

the encore track superheroes- and as well track 10 will not open for me.  i don't know why. i've downloaded it twice. i guess i'll try again."
,tsasvari,2007-11-30T11:43Z,Thank you.
,thnikkaman,2007-12-02T19:50Z,"Yeah, the encore doesn't work for me either, strange. Gonna download it again and see..."
,benihana856,2007-12-04T09:39Z,Thanks a lot
,trippin7464,2007-12-27T07:10Z,Thank you very much... I have every single one of their albums and I'm so glad I can add this to my collection til I can go out and buy it!
,X8,2008-01-15T04:32Z,"Thank my friend PPKLP.
Awesome recording.
Daft Punk sound better thank to you.

From Santiago of Chile (Latinamerica), a lot of thanks.

Have a nice day."
,morreale21,2008-02-04T22:31Z,"Im a little confused. I downloaded the ""fake"" o7 which was the 06 coachella right. but i got the o7 setlist. canone one help me out and give me the 06 correct setlist so I can label properly. I would greatly appreciate. Thnk u"
,dig412,2008-02-19T18:01Z,"The Encore track is only a few characters less than windows' limit, so if the torrent client adds a long extension onto temp files it will be unable to create it. Not sure how you'd get around that."
,Enzainer,2008-02-21T02:37Z,I also get an error.(Bit Comet) any luck with a cause/solution?
,NiXeas,2008-09-27T12:07Z,"Top-class rip! 
Thanks buddy!

ps:Can't do anything with track 13 (encore), can't even move or delete it :s"
,Fox_Almighty,2009-10-30T03:18Z,"Just a heads up, 1 seed and no peers... was downloading at 0.2kb/s, in case anyone wants to save this torrent... in the mean time, I'm going to DemonWizard torrent since it's basically the same."
,nsitaram,2010-01-14T22:42Z,Hey I'm having some problems with the encore track... I can't move it or play it or do anything with it. Some help with that please? I've tried downloading it twice and same problem.
,olglow,2010-03-02T14:34Z,Can someone seed? I at 28.1% and going nowhere.
,olglow,2010-03-04T16:07Z,"This is good, but all of the tracks from disc 2 don't work for me for some reason."
