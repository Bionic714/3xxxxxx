Although here on the site it says that there's one seeder here and 2 seeders for s4, my client tells me there are no seeders for either season. What's going on? Why am I stuck and have been stuck for days? Is no one seeding?"
,levdr,2007-11-28T15:57Z,"Motherfucker! Seeding till we all have around 30 % and then buggering off, leaving us hanging.
You cocksucker!"
,levdr,2007-11-30T15:52Z,"People, go to http://isohunt.com/torrents/?iht=-1&ihq=twilight+zone+s . There you will find the complete collection uploaded by Ithown. Download that torrent file, redirect it to what you already have (or otherwise use a client with which you can partial download) and go. That torrent is alive and kicking."

,levdr,2007-12-02T02:00Z,"I take back what I said and apologize. I have been downloading the other torrent and am ahead of yours now. When I've completed my download, I'll connect with your torrent and help you seed.
Good to have you back. And again: sorry."
,levdr,2007-12-02T02:17Z,"Oh hell, why wait. I'll hook up what I have with your stuff right away. "
