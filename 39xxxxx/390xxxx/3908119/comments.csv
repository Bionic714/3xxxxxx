,xc_90,2007-12-21T15:24Z,whats the diffrent of pal and ntsc
,sidsilva,2007-12-24T14:43Z,"the diference is on some ps2 in usa or north and south america just plays ntsc games, if you put a pal game dont works or stay thje screen on black white and you cannot see all displayed screen because the pal have more resolution lines than the ntsc transmission screen...   and if you use the soft ""pal to ntsc ps2 games"" you got a color screen but you lost the screen or above or down and the game dont have in the option ""adjust screen""  you dont could adjust, and loose game vision or loose hud's!!!
understand, like my tv, the pal games the screen turn off and said no signal!!!  some games stay good with the soft to convert but many stay unseeble, like need for speed carbon pal  converted and black hawk donw and others that i hate to remember i download and dont found in ntsc versions to download again!!   bye"

,MikeAK47,2008-05-28T13:43Z,"Don't mean to ramble on, but the actually filesize for this, (uncompressed) is only 1.1gb.

Yet again, more proof that this is fake/retarded.

I have just downloaded this from BlackCats, and might upload if I get the time!"
,Dreadkillz,2010-10-22T02:16Z,"This is the final nail in the coffin for future downloaders.

The md5 for the ISO is:

be97a79549752c5cd4de8f579d9ea390

This does not match any games checksum in redump.org

So there you go. This torrent is not legit"
