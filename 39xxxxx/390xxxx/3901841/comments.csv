Does it have the songs from the third one?"

One of the song packs contains all the songs from GH1 & GH2.

NOT from Gh3!"

,Gazza_C,2009-04-09T20:52Z,"Chill ppl here is what u need to run Frets on Fire
 - 128 or 256 MB RAM
 - OpenGL graphics card
and that is it, this game requires only the real basics of a pc
also there is a whole lot of songs some, there is most of the GH1 nad the GH2 but im not sure about the GH3 ones, it is worth downloading but you may want to select only the songs you want as it is a large download...
and thanks Mackez and all you seeders for a epic download... the whole thing took only 4 hours :O"
