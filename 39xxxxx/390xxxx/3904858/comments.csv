Extra notes:
-If you have previously had any CS3 apps installed on youre system you will have to completely uninstall and clean registry. Use CS3clean (www.adobe.com/support/contact/cs3clean.html )
-Attempting to use the updater is like playing Russian roulette. It works sometimes and renders to suite usless other times.
-Ensure you have minimum system requirements before installing."

So once again, thank you :)"
[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-11-29T02:46Z,For those who are unfamilure with Keygens and AV software interaction it is like this. Most AV programs have similar C++ or VB scripting in their virus database that is used to create a Keygen so therfore flags it as a threat. Because the programing used to create a keygen is very similar to some viruses or malware (basicaly a single complex algoritmic calculation) it can be recognized as such. But the only thing this Keygen is malicious to is the Adobe Company. Hope this helps with some paranoia.
,donnonotin,2007-11-29T04:45Z,"This torrent fixes the corruption problem with the older one. I know as I have had the pleasure of downloading it twice... The keygen works harmlessly. I've ran it with Embarq's Online Security installed as well as the McAffe provided by Comcast.

It installed all of the components with ease from a DVD-R. When I generated my key I pressed the generate button about 4-5 times, it updates flawlessly.

For the people tripping about getting a virus I have only have one problem since installation. my computer locks up and gets blue screen'd. Then it dumps the ram into a temp file and shuts down. (Vista x86)

Though I'm not sure this is due to virus activity, I think it is possibly just a malfunction within windows. (As these incidents happened while any cs3 app was closed) What I did was I updated my cs3 suite and installed iTunes/QT for AE. 

Hope this post has been informative. and Thanks finsterc ur torrents performs great."

It didn't work!

My guess is if you install it as a trial, and then use the dll cracks linked by a.squirrel above, it *might* work. But it doesn't work using the Keygen. It goes through the install ok, but only ends up installing 4 or 5 of the programs - and NOT the ones you want, believe me!

However, I can confirm that this one works perfect: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3907426/Adobe_CS3_Master_Collection_Corporate_ISO._Works_

I downloaded them both simultaneously and this FINsTeRc one finished first, but when it didn't work for me I uninstalled it, restarted my pc and then installed that one. It looked like the exact same keygen but it wasn't cut up into rar-files.

,OverMachoGrande,2008-02-10T18:29Z,"Ok... HOLY CRAP, this one WORKS! Thank you FiNsTeRc!

I've tried countless versions of cracked cs3 programs, and I really think this one is the only one with a working After Effects.  For some reason, all of the cracked versions EXPIRE when it's a 2008 date.

FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT AREN'T HAVING SUCCESS WITH THIS DOWNLOAD... I think I can tell you exactly what the solution is for the two main problems you are having based on trial and error and countless wasted hours, analyzing all the variables:

PROBLEM 1) When only 4 or 5 of the crappy programs install, and all of the good ones don't, here is the solution:  You *have* to let BONJOUR SERVICE access the internet.  

I have PC Tools free firewall (Zone Alarm screws up my system and slows my Vaio down too much).  When ""Setup"" or ""Adobe Setup"" or any variaion of that asks permission to access the internet, DENY IT.  Towards the end of the installation is when ""Bonjour"" will ask permission.  YOU HAVE TO LET THIS ACCESS THE INTERNET.   This program will NOT rat you out to adobe, and you can google it and find that Adobe maintains that no information passes to adobe from Bonjour.

There *is* a way to uninstall Bonjour that requires a little bit of code and tampering with the registry, but I'm not worrying about it yet.  I'm just happy that everything works.

If you're like me, and you have a tough time watching the computer screen for the asinine amount of time it takes to install this, you'll probably miss the prompt for Bonjour.  Well, the pop-up from your firewall will still be there, so allow it to access the internet, and then re-install everything and it will remember that it now has permission and you?ll be fine.

PROBLEM 2)  You get the error message that the licensing is expired.  Ok, after googling that problem, this happens for two reasons, the first being the fact that a lot of these cracked cs3's (well... at least After Effects) for some reason expire.  They are fine when you set the date to Pre-September, but bump the clock back up to present-tense and it's expired.  Maybe a lot of these cracks were done on student versions??  There isn't a fix for this, you just need another cracked version, and one that doesn't expire in 2008... like this one!

The second reason you might be getting that message *is* fixable... and the problem stems from the fact that at some point we had downloaded versions of some of the products on our system (either we downloaded the official trials or the cracked version was originally an official trial).  For some reason, the licensing expires, and this was a big problem even for the people that PAID MONEY and bought the products from Adobe!  They came up with a fix, and it's already mentioned in this thread and it's their  WinCS3Clean tool at http://www.adobe.com/support/contact/cs3clean.html.

What you MAY NOT KNOW, is that there is a SECRET OPTION 3 and 4.  Run option 4!  Even though Adobe says that option 2 will remove all traces of adobe... it doesn't.  It takes secret option 4 to do that.

I also read somewhere that you should set the clock back to pre-Septmeber (I chose August 19th, 2007 as the date) and run the secret option 4 again so I did that, and I do think it removed a little more.  Maybe it will or won?t for you, but I do actually think that was important.  I can?t take credit for discovering that? like I said, I read it somewhere! Lol? Anyway...

Then go through the steps of installing FiNsTeRc?s CS3... which after WEEKS of trying every other cs3 torrent out there, this is the only one that I've found that will give you a working After Effects (as well as everything else).

Oh, just one thing, it said that Adobe Contribute wouldn't install, but that's the only problem I've found.  That?s literally it though!

Later peeps!  I felt it was my duty to help out some people that were having those two main problems *I* was having!  I would have posted this a couple of days ago, but I had to register for the forum and it wasn?t sending me an activation email!

,OverMachoGrande,2008-02-12T05:52Z,"thebarran...

I thought I read somewhere -probably on another cs3 thread- that people were having some trouble when they mounted it to a virtual drive vs. burning it to DVD.  Did you burn it to DVD??

,bej1223,2008-02-12T17:39Z,is power iso works too? and can extract the dvd image??
,OverMachoGrande,2008-02-12T18:01Z,"Yeah, PowerISO works, and it extracts onto one DVD.  I think I have version 3.8, by the way.  There's a 3.9 floating around, too, but 3.8 works fine!

So after you finish the download of this torrent, you'll have a bunch of .rar files.  They are in an automatic archive or something, so just extract the first one and it will create a folder with the full 3 gig ISO image.  Just mount the ISO after that and don't worry about those rar's anymore.

Use PowerISO or whatever program you have that allows you to burn the extracted contents and you're set!

After that, if you try to install it and it says something about the licensing expiring OR only 5 or so programs install, look at my really long post on how to fix it.

,dialate,2008-03-01T16:07Z,"BTW thanx for the flawless upload FiNsTeRc, I think my artsy fartsy gf just wet herself when she saw the icons I copied to the desktop X-D.

BTW for those of you having probs, here's my setup:
- Windows Vista (eXPerience's TinyVista Rv01 version)
- AMD Athlon X2 Dual Core 4.6 GHz + overclocked
- 2GB Corsair DDR2-1066 + overclocked
- nVidia 8800GTS + overclocked/Direct X 10/latest drivers

,OverMachoGrande,2008-10-22T21:21Z,"Hey guys... a couple of things.  I know that favor has gone to looking for cs4 downloads, but it's only been out a couple of days so I don't really trust the ones that are online right now.

I just finished re-wiping my drive (I do that every 6 months or so because your computer runs SO SWEET afterwards), and I was re-installing this CS3 download and there was a slight problem with the keygen.  Apparently microsoft -in one of their security updates- has made it so you no longer have ""permission"" to open that file.

Here's how you resolve it, and get the serial from the keygen.  Start it in safe mode, THEN open it.  Get a couple of serials and save them in a text file, and the restart the computer normally (you won't be able to install the whole disk in safe mode).

I'm still in the process of re-installing it as I type this, but if I recall... this version is cracked so all you need is a vald serial number and you DON'T HAVE TO ACTIVATE IT.

Here's a couple of serial numbers that should work if you have the same problem:

1325-1993-2571-9002-2226-3236

1325-1998-9607-5524-5775-2502

1325-1998-1031-9773-5090-0142

Ok, I want to tell you about this, too...  here's another problem that I had randomly a few months ago for some reason (and I saw someone else mention it).  For some reason out of the blue, my licensing for the product just STOPPED WORKING.  I *think* it happened after I updated quicktime, but I'm not sure.

It turns out that what happened was that the ""Flexnet licensing service"" got turned off, and it wouldn't automatically start again when I restarted the computer.  

Go to Control Panel-->Administrative Tools-->Services, find the Flexnet program, and ""restart"" it and set it to start automatically.  Like I said, for some reason that got screwed up.  As soon as I did that, it worked fine.

Lol... all this work and in two weeks I'm probably going to uninstall it for CS4 anyway, but I wanted to pass it on.

Oh, by the way... for you newbies out there, always bookmark your torrent threads so you can go back and see if the same problems happen."

The one included has maxed its limit and the ones I found in the comments didn't work either.  It seems every thing I try to download has issues with the keys, as we all know, but I was hoping this one I could get done smoooothly.  

Can you help?  I am not learned in keygen yet...
thx. 
bryan"
