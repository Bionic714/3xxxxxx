Several innovations to vector-based illustration originated with CorelDRAW: a node-edit tool that operates differently on different objects, fit text-to-path, stroke-before-fill, quick fill/stroke color selection palettes, perspective projections, mesh fills and complex gradient fills.

CorelDRAW differentiates itself from its competitors in a number of ways. The first is its positioning as a graphics suite, rather than just a vector graphics program. Second, the package consistently includes a large collection of fonts and clip art. The biggest improvement with CorelDRAW over other graphic software programs is its ability to edit bitmaps. A full range of editing tools allow the user to adjust contrast, color balance, change the format from RGB to CMYK, add special effects such as Vignettes and special borders to bitmaps. Bitmaps can also be edited more extensively using Corel PhotoPaint, opening the bitmap directly from CorelDRAW and returning to the program after saving.

CorelDRAW's chief competitor is Adobe Illustrator. Although they are both vector-based illustration programs, the user experience differs greatly between the two. For instance, CorelDRAW can work with multi-page documents directly; Illustrator only offers a single-page layout view, but it will allow you to divide that large layout in the print options so that it prints on multiple pages. While Illustrator will read CorelDRAW's native file type and vice versa, the translation is almost never perfect. CorelDRAW can open Adobe PDF files: Adobe PageMaker and InDesign, Microsoft Publisher and Word, and several other programs can print documents to PDF using the Adobe PDFWriter printer driver, which CorelDRAW can then open and edit every aspect of the original layout and design. CorelDRAW can also open PowerPoint Presentations with little or no problem.

CorelDRAW Graphics Suite

Over time, additional components were developed or acquired and bundled with CorelDRAW. The list of bundled packages usually changes somewhat from one release to the next. There are several mainstays that have remained in the package for many releases now, however: PowerTRACE (a bitmap to vector graphic converter), PHOTO-PAINT (a bitmap graphic editor), and CAPTURE (a screen capture utility).

The current version of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite, X3 (actually version 13), contains the following packages:

    * CorelDRAW: Vector graphics editing software
    * Corel PHOTO-PAINT: Raster image creation and editing software
    * Corel CAPTURE: Enables several methods of image-capture
    * Corel PowerTRACE: Converts raster images to vector graphics.
    * Pixmantec RawShooter Essentials: Support for RAW file format
