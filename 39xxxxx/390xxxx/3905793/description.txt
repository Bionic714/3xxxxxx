Lady Snowblood 2, Love Song Of Vengeance (1974) - Rmvb

HKFlix Says:  

Surprisingly different from the first film, yet surprisingly equal. Superb direction, a great, moody piece. 

Avg. Rating:  3.5 / 5 (based on 3 ratings).

Plot: Lady Snowblood has been found guilty of murder and sentenced to die, but is set free by Kikui, the head of the secret police. She is recruited into his service as a political infiltrator. His target is a key figure in the movement against the Emperor. 
 
Overview: 1905. The end of the Russo-Japanese War that has created a new self confidence in Japan, and underpinned the power of the militarists and right extremists. 
Yuki Kashima (Lady Snowblood) has been found guilty of multiple murder and sentenced to hang. Set free by Kikui, the ruthless head of the secret police, she is recruited into his service as a political infiltrator. His target is Ransui Tokunaga, a key figure in the anarchist movement that threatens the establishment of the Emperor. 

Tokunaga possesses a document that could blow away the forces of reaction and the government, in the form of a letter that reveals their involvement in framing and executing a number of innocent people in order to further their own political ends. 

Before this affair is concluded, which mixes personal tragedy with public tyranny, Lady Snowblood will have again set herself firmly on the side of the outlaws, the dispossessed and the oppressed, as her sword paints a bespattered train of carnage that leads to the very heart of corruption. 
 
Cast: Meiko Kaji  ||  Yoshio Harada  ||  Kazuko Yoshiyuki (Kaxuko Yoshiyuki)  ||  Shin Kishida  ||  Juzo Itami
