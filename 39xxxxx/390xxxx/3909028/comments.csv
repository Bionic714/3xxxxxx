You just deserve to shove the PSP up your ASS.

What do you mean by unrar????

Are you drunk or something??

.cso is one of the native PSP game format

Going by your comment I dont think you have the slightest clue of a PSP being hacked

Oh God! Why do such people even join TPB? WHY??"

,ditrom,2010-09-22T03:29Z,"@ hiladi and guitarplayer5544 

Why are you guys so self centered?
At some point even you two ""Pros"" 
had no clue what a cso was. You weren't born knowing. Just cause some one isn't as knowledgeable as you at something ""ESPECIALLY something as insignificant as gaming."" dosn't give you the right to put them down. Whats happening to common courtesy these days? 

@ animatorsimen 

You must have a custom firmware installed on a magic memory stick in order to play free games.
If you have psp 2000 or 3000 you also need a pandora battery pack. Where as the psp fat 1000 only requires a magic memory stick and custom firmware.

The following can be ordered here:
pandorasales.com

I got my battery pack / memory stick from there and they even installed the latest custom firmware for me saving me the hastle. They also have the BEST prices. "
