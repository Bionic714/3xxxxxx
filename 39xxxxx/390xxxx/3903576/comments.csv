Not encoded properly?"
,partsguyx,2007-11-26T00:37Z,"Maybe the cause is from the long path of encoding it from VHS to DVD, (ripped to hard drive first)  then to Divx (from DVD) I know the quality is poor (what isn't when ripping from VHS??) but I cannot explain the jitters. Maybe somebody has an original DVD (I've seen them on eBay & Amazon fetching upwards of $250 !!!) that would be willing to rip to Divx. This is all I've got......"
