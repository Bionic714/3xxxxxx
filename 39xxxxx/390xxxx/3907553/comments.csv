[T],Dark_Swordsman,2007-12-09T21:27Z,"ok, i just logged in to check my feedback and to see what stupid foul-mouthed leecher is cussing me out this time for unwittingly breaking a taboo  (using a format other than iso when i uploaded my game)(use Alcohol, you dumasses, thats what i use) (For all you guys who didnt cuss me out, i will have an iso up soon and i will reseed the Kung Fu avi too)
ok i will put Neil Back up in a bit i am glad someone likes Neil"
[T],Dark_Swordsman,2007-12-09T21:33Z,"ok , Neil is up
Enjoy, and please seed for a while. i try to seed my stuff when i can, but i have downloading to do tooo. I stopped the Neil Young torrent before because i saw a few seeders and i figured i can dowlaad faster. This time i will keep the torrent and seed here and there. This vid was messed up somehow and i fixed it. it may have been damaged somehow out here.
Enjoy."
