I have the 3 double sided discs of Season 2 which I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll split into 6 seperate torrents. There a quite a few episodes on each disc so enjoy. I only have limited hard disc space so can only seed a few of these torrents, so please seed as long as you can so I can delete some and seed new ones. Keep the torrent alive! It will be slow at first as I have terrible connection speed but be persistant, I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll keep it alive as long as possible.

I have used DVD Shrink to bring them down in size but they are still pretty big. Sorry, hopefully I can work out a way to make them smaller than what they are.

If someone has Season 1 please use the comments to let me know where I can download. Thanks everyone.

I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll put the full season here www.thepiratebay.org/user/perthscanner
