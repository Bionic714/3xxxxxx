,Booyakasa,2007-11-23T01:38Z,wait...there is a movie?
,phiau,2007-11-23T01:49Z,"Yep... I watched it yesterday thanks to divX.org ... and now I'm sharing the love.

I recommend the DivX player for best playback quality, but any divx capable player should be fine"

,Padro,2007-11-25T06:30Z,this is a perfect rip. but if you want it to play on your standalone dvd-divxplayer you have to rename the file-ending to .avi

,jimi03,2007-12-15T23:07Z,"This is the first torrent I have downloaded so Im unaware of how to use this. I have not been able to open this file. I downloaded it yesterday, without having a .divx player. I tried to open it with a random .dixv player i found online. I was just wondering what player everyone uses. Thank you so much to whoever helps!"
