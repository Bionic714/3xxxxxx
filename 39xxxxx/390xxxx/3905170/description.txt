DESPISED ICON

Despised Icon is a Canadian deathcore band from Montreal. The band was formed by members of Neuraxis, In Dying Days and Heaven\\\'s Cry, in January 2002.

The band is noted for the use of two full-time vocalists, Alexandre Erian, who sings using a mid-range screaming technique, and Steve Marois for the extremely low growls, high pitched screams, and \\\"pig squeals\\\". Despised Icon is known for its work in the underground music industry, having been met with both critical acclaim and appraisal for its efforts in deathcore music.
