,msdash,2008-01-09T15:16Z,"hmmm, the dvd menu don't seem to work. :("
[T],minOdroL,2008-01-12T23:04Z,"Thanks a lot this is great stuff! Still DLing but when finished will seed at least 1:1. Tho 23.71GiB is a lot to seed on a 8/1 connection. ;)

Maybe needs to be re-authored in dvd-shrink if menu doesn't work?

,keesie33,2008-01-24T15:23Z,Thank you very much..... i love it.
,Ubehage,2008-02-25T23:45Z,"The video, menu and audio is UNTOUCHED."
,fate6479,2008-03-07T19:05Z,thanks so much for this!
,prehensil,2008-03-14T05:08Z,"Played this in Mplayer and VLC and got skips in the same places. Any recommendations on how I could fix this?

Used utorrent to download."
,Ofrack,2008-03-16T11:40Z,"I got the same thing as ""prehensil"" it jumps a round 
even the captain goes two times to mother!

I am now going here [url]http://fanedit.org/wpTF/?p=130[/url]"
,prehensil,2008-03-19T08:11Z,"I got it to play tolerably well in mplayer for the first two movies with the following command line.

mplayer dvd://X -dvd-device ""...Alien.iso"" -cache 8192 -aid Y

X being the track so sometimes it was 1, other times it was 2. 

Y was the audio track which was some number between 128 and 130 if I recall correctly.

The third movie is impressively messed up. It is like the entire movie was shuffled around like a crappy techno track.

No one else has these problems?"
,zerojero,2008-03-26T20:45Z,"Same issues here. I used VLC palyer, Zoom player and Nero. The frames are skipping all the time and the audio is garbled during these skips."
,kojack44,2008-03-28T18:49Z,Both of Alien & Alien 3 skip & jump around so thanks for the up but im not seeding anymore if its not good. 50% is enough still nearly 20gb Dam waste
,Ofrack,2008-04-11T14:43Z,"Hey guys,I have reinstalled my computer.
So what?  
The DVD's did not play very well by me as I mentioned.

I'll guess something was wrong, now they all play good.

Perhaps reinstall the video player is enough, I don't know what it was.

But the Torrent is NOT a bad one!"
,argulle,2008-04-20T17:26Z,"Needs more seeders. 23.71 gb will take ages when downloading 15kb/s

When its done ill seed for a day to "
,VicVega,2008-06-30T19:15Z,"I'd like to have all the five bonus discs as DVD9 (if they were originally DVD9, that is) so if anybody has those, please share..."
,hedgehog1971,2008-07-09T05:01Z,"I don't know if this will be of any use to anyone, but with regards to jumping, the torrent may not be at fault. I bought ""Alien - Special Edition"" and found that there were frequent pauses and jumps throughout, which matched the jumps and pauses in the torrent. Not the first ""special ed"" film I have encountered with this problem. It seems the original press is to blame - hope this is of help."
,jomos352,2008-08-13T07:18Z,are there any problems (such as video jumping) in aliens (alien 2)?
,Ofrack,2008-10-16T09:10Z,"People, unpack the ISO I used bold Winrar.
And I watched it with Nero showvieuw Alien and Aliens noting is wrong.
It seems to be that there is something not right with them.

In aliens wen Ripley in the elavator at the end there is a little disturbances for a second or two.
On Alien 3 there are no Dutch subs.
The last one is still coming in. "
,wolfhauser,2008-11-27T18:51Z,Are these special editions or the originales?
,Ubehage,2009-02-11T23:53Z,wolfhauser: Look at the title.
,beenbee,2009-06-10T18:01Z,Could you possibly reveal what software was used to make those iso's ? 
,OlaNordmann7,2009-11-18T03:07Z,"Oh great! I have been on the look-out for this, for some time now! I hope you still will be sharing this for some time to come ""Ubehage"", and hope that others also will share this when they have downloaded it! Regards from Norway!"
