Mofo
I will follow
Gone
Even better than the real thing
Last night on earth
Until the end of the world
New year's day
Pride (In the name of love)
I still haven't found what I'm looking for
All I want is you
Desire
Staring at the sun
Sunday bloody sunday
Bullet the blue sky
Please
Where the streets have no name
Lemon (Perfecto mix)
Discothèque
If you wear that velvet dress
With or without you
Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me
Mysterious ways
One
Wake up dead man

I'm at 85% please seed and i'll leave it going for a long time.
I know you're the only one, but just leave the pc open if possible."

You are probably using FAT32 filesystem so then you are screwed...there´s a limit of max file size 4 GB for that filesystem.

U should upgrade to NTFS if possible"
