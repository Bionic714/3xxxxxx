In the Trollenberg mountains, there's a radioactive cloud sitting on the summit of a mountain.  When mountain climbers start having horrible accidents and winding up dead and usually decapitated, Professor Crevett calls in his old friend and scientific investigator, Alan Brooks.  Alan and the professor had seen this same situation years earlier in the Andes mountains, only that time, they weren't able to get any hard evidence to back up their story of what happened there.  On his way to Trollenberg, Alan meets Ann and Sarah Pilgrim on the train.  Ann is a psychic, and as they pass the Trollenberg mountains, she goes into a psychic trance and then passes out.  When she awakens, she insists that her and her sister, who were on their way to Munich, stop in Trollenberg instead.  What mysterious force is drawing this beautiful young girl to this place?  Will Alan finally find what he's been searching for lo these many years?
