?In her most influential book Gender Trouble (1990), Butler argued that feminism had made a mistake by trying to assert that ?women? were a group with common characteristics and interests. That approach, Butler said, performed ?an unwitting regulation and reification of gender relations? ? reinforcing a binary view of gender relations in which human beings are divided into two clear-cut groups, women and men. Rather than opening up possibilities for a person to form and choose their own individual identity, therefore, feminism had closed the options down.?"
