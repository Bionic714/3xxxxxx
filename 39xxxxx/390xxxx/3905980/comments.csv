""A 2GB file called bs-d4.mdf (not sure about this)


From Google:

Question:
What is an *.MDF file? 

Answer:
If it is a rather large file, e.g. 650 MB, then it is most likely a CD image. If it is a file of smaller size, see at the end of this article. These MDF image files are created using a CD/DVD CD/DVD image file editor (and CD burner and CD/DVD backup tool) called MagicISO Maker. 

Think it would be prudent to wait till the uploader gives some more detail as Ubehage suggests
