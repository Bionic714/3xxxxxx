So we still need a few more time to complete this DBZ series and for me, its worth the wait since it is the BEST DBZ that you can download today."

,ssjaris,2008-07-31T02:07Z,please rencode them with h.246 and they will be with the same quality 50mb each episode. it would be easier to seed! there are 2 torrents like that but they don't include subs. please think serious my comment! i will wait =)
