,social_parasite,2007-11-27T20:43Z,this only the demo (1.0.0.1)! there isn't a crack nor anything else! you can't save nor finish the game; or wasn't i able to do these? 
,petrinm,2007-11-29T11:40Z,This is not a demo and there is crack and serial code.
,social_parasite,2007-12-04T00:03Z,ok and where are them?
,Macki93,2007-12-07T15:14Z,Love this game(:
,rraptorr,2007-12-14T01:51Z,social_parasite: Just unrar this PROPERLY (preferably with WinRar).
,djnforce9,2007-12-14T04:38Z,"@social_parasite: What do you mean ""Where are they?"". Maybe in a little folder called ""crack.rar"". It's right there when you extract out of the part archives. Just use that and you're set."
,khemaut,2008-01-05T00:40Z,"Just one comment to everybody downloading this, The publishers have decided to release it as freeware. You can get it off of their site and not have to worry about cracks ect."
,oneiros23me,2008-01-05T07:50Z,"I don't think they have released this one as freeware -- they released the Abe Lincoln one from last season to promote this season's releases.
This download works perfectly. Just unrar and crack it as normal. 
The funniest Sam and Max so far."
,mungo75,2008-01-05T14:59Z,"Just had a look at the telltale website.

Abe Lincoln episode is free, this episode is US$8.95 and the whole second season is US$35

Cheers to the uploader."
,mungo75,2008-01-07T03:20Z,"This is the best one yet - Jimmy Two Teeth's son was hilarious. Pity they are so short though, finished in about 2 hours."
,Edgemaster1987,2008-02-13T17:59Z,Hey every1 the 3rd episode is out now (just came out 2 min. ago)
,Edgemaster1987,2008-02-14T17:26Z,"This is the best begining of the new season ever save the x-mas some new charactors, Bosco is more paranoid than the last season. The best part is when Max says he don't have anything to say...
A little help when you're going to wisit Stinkey's Diner and the trivia begins, say hi to Stinky (grand Daugther to the former owner) and then so long... go talk to abe's head, talk about trivia and tell him that you think the answer is C (the correct Answer is B) enjoy....
Oh by the way Ep. 203 had the premier yesterday at 5.50 P.M CET"
,Edgemaster1987,2008-02-16T14:57Z,"Can you get episode 203... i've tryed both torrents under Sam & Max Season 2
loder is the only one who have episode 203 but if you got WinRar you've got a problem (it'll need a file(r or e00)) so PLZ upload Episode 203"
