,buntysingh,2007-11-23T12:27Z,"I am seeding but here it says ""0"" seeders?? Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong??"
,Sinnersfury,2007-11-23T16:24Z,No sweat. Seeders/leechers usually takes a while to update. I have one seeder and 41 leechers atm so you're there :)
,dechamp,2007-11-24T07:53Z,NTSC or PAL?
,buntysingh,2007-11-24T22:33Z,NTSC - I guess. But I hope it is free for all players.
,vilescum,2007-11-25T09:01Z,seed please
,buntysingh,2007-11-25T18:31Z,I am seeding - has anyone downloaded the whole movie till now?
,buntysingh,2007-11-30T14:08Z,I've seeded more than 9GB and yet I'm the only seeder? 
,stratoss,2007-12-01T11:18Z,"You are not the only seeder. Every leecher become a seeder, and I can see many many people at 59.9%, waiting for you. Learn to fly, my friend."
,wideo,2008-01-29T16:18Z,Please re-seed - stuck at 59.9%!
,mailelin,2008-02-20T23:13Z,"Does anyone know why everybody gets stuck at 59.9%? I can see that there are people connected with 100% of the file, yet I am not able to download anymore..."
