This is a DL release and will ONLY work with Intel C2D or Core1 cpu's. 

It is the install that I run personally and works with my P35 chipset and nVidia card.

There is NO AMD SUPPORT and NO NFORCE SUPPORT. 

This release is intended for use on real macs or on machines that are very close to a real mac. It uses pc_efi to start the process so there is no need for patching and post-patching.

If you have a machine with NFORCE or ATI chips, then this download is not for you. I encourage y'all to go with nVidia and Intel... There is a reason that Apple did.
