That isn't very helpful, it obviously isn't 100% since it was encoded from a DVD (hopefully). It would be nice of you could download a program like GSpot (http://www.headbands.com/gspot) or MediaInfo (http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net) and use them to list the quality of the file here or make an nfo we can dl."
[T],_Maelstrom_,2007-11-25T04:15Z,"It's sad that you think (and assume) that.
It isn't unreasonable to want to know the quality of a file before downloading (and seeding!). For all I know the file is a CAM, or has a bad aspect ratio, or is full screen, or has a low bitrate, or ... any of the MANY other problems that tend to crop up when you have no idea if the file was encoded well.

If anyone else finishes this file and would care to spend the minute it takes to find the video information, please post it. TYIA"
,blemishednicely,2007-12-04T07:09Z,"Waiting to free up space on my laptop (damn I need a PC!), but personally, I would rather have it in fullscreen than wide, anyway. People seem to think widescreen is so fucking great when it only actually sees REAL benefit with a likewise widescreen TV (an item which, statistically speaking, MOST people do not possess-yet they flock to it like mindless sheep because they were basically told to & do not understand). Besides that, you can always change the ratio yourself once it's ready to run on your computer, so point is somewhat moot for aspect ratio. Maelstrom has somewhat of a point in that many people WOULD prefer some added info, but I can understand looksee finding that accessability is the important thing and there's already been enough work/time invested (not to mention it is stated as being a ""beginner's"" project-which usually don't come loaded), and quite simply that it's there if you want it, if you don't...well just keep going (no offence to you). Myself I like this movie, and am glad to have the opportunity-regardless as to the condition of the autorun & menu-besides that, what more do you want for free? At worst, you could tide yorself over w/ this one & look for a more ""complete"" version. Thanks, looksee! Sorry for the novel!"
[T],_Maelstrom_,2007-12-04T20:55Z,"Nothing wrong with novels. :)
Well my initial point was simply that with a little info we could decide for ourselves if a torrent was worth downloading. This is a personal source of irritation for me on public torrent sites and occasionally the poster is actually positively responsive.

Interesting comments blemishednicely. We all have our own standards as to what is worth downloading ...and more importantly seeding (as this is what keeps it all going)... and the fact that we differ on this emphasizes the need for at least some basic info on what is posted.

I know it is OT, but I would disagree emphatically about your points on widescreen video. The benefits are there even without a widescreen TV. There are many, many reasons, among the most important of which is that it preserves the film in the format the Director intended and that human vision is naturally widescreen. I could go on but that is a discussion for another place than a torrent comment box =). If you are interested though I have added some links below that may explain most of my reasoning, but in the end, to each their own.

Anyhow, again this shows, if nothing else, that some basic video information would let us all decide what we think would be best to use our bandwidth and HDD space for.

,spawn10462,2007-12-19T23:05Z,"I did try windows media, and I get no playback at all. I guess I'll try updating my codecs. I also tried playing it thru Divx player and the video is fine, but the audio is still lagging."
,spawn10462,2007-12-23T00:01Z,"Hey hey, whaddaya know? VLC player fixed the problem. I knew I had it laying around somewhere. Good vid and audio quality here, once you get it playing right. :p Not a cam."
