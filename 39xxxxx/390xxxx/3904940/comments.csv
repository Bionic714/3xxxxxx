Wishing you a happy new year."
,agbm,2010-02-06T22:41Z,"ATTENTION!

This is NOT the Media Edition, but the SOLUTIONS MANUAL will still be applicable.  Why?  They pretty much just shortened and added some sections.  The problems are all the same and so are all the answers as well.  It's a great find, but you need to do some searching for the answers.  For example, a section in your Media Edition that would regularly be in the appendix will actually be in chapter 1 of the solutions manual. You just need to hunt around for the titles of chapter sections and disregard the numerical values (using Rates of Change and Limits instead of chapter and section ""2.1"")

So if you have the 11th edition media edition and are just into it for the solutions manual, you will be fine with download!

,Foaman,2010-05-24T07:15Z,"Book sucks.  No guided walkthroughs in the solutions manual.  Whatever, though.  Thanks."
,manofthewild07,2010-08-24T02:19Z,"Thanks man, this stupid book is 180 dollars new! I'm already paying over 300 dollars per credit for the class, plus that? Yeah right!
