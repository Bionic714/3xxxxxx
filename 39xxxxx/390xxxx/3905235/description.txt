Release Notes:

Curb recording artist Rodney Atkins has another smash single on his
hands as "If You're Going Through Hell (Before The Devil Even Knows)"
climbs into the top 10 on the R&R and Billboard singles charts. The
music video for the single is also in rotation on CMT and GAC.

The song is the first single and title track from Atkins' second Curb
album, due in stores on July 18. For the East Tennessee born and bred
singer/songwriter, the new album is closer to home than his first
release.

"We found plenty of great songs for my last album but not all of them
matched me," Atkins says. "Now we're thinking differently. When I
heard this song I loved it. It makes such a powerful statement."

As does the album that shares the song's name. While his 2003 release
Honesty included a top 5 smash in the title track, If You're Going
Through Hell is a much better representation of who Atkins' is and
where he fits in the country landscape.

Songs like "These Are My People," "About The South" and "A Man On A
Tractor" reveal the simple, rural truths Atkins grew up with and
seeks to carry on through his own family...and his music. "Every song
I sing is about the world as I know it. Every word is real. I'm not
going to sing it if it isn't."
