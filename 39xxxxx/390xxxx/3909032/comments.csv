,daemonen,2008-08-18T01:48Z,"To play this game on your PSP, you must have a custom firmware. In my case I have a 4.01 m33-2. Then connect your PSP to your computer and put on USB mode. Check if you have a ISO folder on your root directory on your memory stick. If you dont see any ISO folder, you need to format your memory stick from your PSP. If you have now the ISO folder on the root directory on memory stick, copy the file onto ISO folder then back to PSP. If you got an error message, here's the trick. Press hold on SELECT button on you PSP and you will see a MENU. M33 VSH MENU. Under the UMD ISO MODE, you need to set to M33 driver, then exit. Now you can play ISO file on your PSP now. Hope this will solve your problem."
