This is a silent film, hence there is not a spoken language.

The dialog cards interspersed throughout the film are in English.

This is the restored version, with the restoration performed by the German film archive.

From the IMDB:

A man named Francis relates a story about his best friend Alan and his fiancÃ©e Jane. Alan takes him to a fair where they meet Dr. Caligari, who exhibits a somnambulist, Cesare, that can predict the future. When Alan asks how long he has to live, Cesare says he has until dawn. The prophecy comes to pass, as Alan is murdered, and Cesare is a prime suspect. Cesare creeps into Jane's bedroom and abducts her, running from the townspeople and finally dying of exhaustion. Meanwhile, the police discover a dummy in Cesare's cabinet, while Caligari flees. Francis tracks Caligari to a mental asylum. He is the director! Or is he?

-------------------------

The film is much better than the description might suggest, as the film makers made the most extensive use of optical illusions and technique that the times would allow.

A classic.

Visual techniques used in other films such as Queen of the Damned, in which the videos in the film were obviously paying homage to this great/classic film.
