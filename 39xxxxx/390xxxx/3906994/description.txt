GUITAR HEROES album gathers the baddest and most respected metalguitarists from Finland together. The album is purely instrumental and it will contain guitarists like Timo Tolkki (Stratovarius), Alexi Laiho and Roope Latvala (Children Of Bodom), Emppu Vuorinen (Nightwish), Esa Holopainen (Amorphis), Sakari Hietala (Tarot), Tuomio (ex-Impaled Nazarene), Euge Valovirta (Godsplague, Suburban Tribe), Mikko Salovaara (Kiuas), Nino Laurenne (Thunderstone) and Mr. Crab (Bleak).

The rhythm section contains the drummer Kai Hahto (Wintersun, Rotten Sound) and bassplayer Lauri Porra (Stratovarius, Warmen, Kotipelto).

Each guitarist has composed their own songs without any chaining elements and the album ends with a song containg all the guitarists together.

Producer Nino Laurenne (Thunderstone) said that "It was great to have all the guitarists I wanted on this album. Most of them have even recorded with their own amplifiers and therefore their unique sound can be heard on this album."
