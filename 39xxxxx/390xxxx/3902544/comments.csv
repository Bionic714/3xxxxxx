,Ryags153,2008-10-25T17:03Z,That's why it is called keasby nights as performed by Streetlight Manifesto
,fck_authority,2008-11-14T20:59Z,Streetlight Manifesto is comprised of several members of Catch-22. And both bands have an album called Keasby Nights.
,drunk_n_punk,2008-12-19T09:31Z,"Well you guys are sorta right. What happened was Catch 22 was formed a while ago and was a great band. The frontman wrote ALL of the songs; guitar, drums, bass, horns, etc. All of the music entirely. So everything was going well, they put out Keasbey Nights, and a few years later on the band decides they want to kick the frontman out of the band. They do and so he starts Streetlight Manifesto playing the songs that he wrote. Catch 22 tried to sue him and lost, and so the whole Keasbey Nights by Streetlight Manifesto is just a fuck you to Catch 22.

Awesome music."
,Looby757,2009-01-29T19:53Z,"ugh, thats not what happened. Tomas Kalnoky left to go to college. When he came back to being in a band, Streetlight Manifesto, he heard that the record label was about to re-release the cd with bonus tracks on it, so he said he'd re-record it with Streetlight cause he never liked how it sounded in the first place."
,Standerfred,2009-03-16T03:40Z,yep. drunk n punk is waaaayy off. he actually started Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution first. And many Streetlight members are from there. not Catch 22. there was never even a law suit. there's rumor that catch 22 and streetlight have sent secret messages to each other through song though.
,angelogamer,2009-03-25T04:39Z,"I belive one of those alleged messages is in Streetlight's song A Moment of Silence, where one of the lyrics goes like this 

I connect and I read every word you said
Like a child who believes he was wronged
If you hate me so much then stop singing my songs

Kalnoky says that he is on good terms with Catch 22, but that lyric sounds pretty specific to me.

Catch 22 has a supposed message too, but I don't know which song or where in it it is."
