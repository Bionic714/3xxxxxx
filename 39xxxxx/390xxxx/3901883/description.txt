Synopsis

In the never-before-seen episode â??Mickey Saves Santa,â?? the â??sensational sixâ?? â?? Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald, Daisy and Pluto â?? get ready to celebrate Christmas eve when Dasher the reindeer shows up at the clubhouse carrying a note from Santa: his sleigh broke down at the top of Mistletoe Mountain. Mickey and Donald hurry off to help Santa, using a spotlight to see through the clouds, skis to slide over the snow, gumdrops to power Chip and DaleÂ´s gingerbread train, and a ribbon to tie the harness to SantaÂ´s sleigh.

â??Mickey Go Seekâ??: During a game of hide-n-seek, Mickey asks the audience to help find Donald. During the search, audiences discover the rest of MickeyÂ´s friends and help them find missing things.

â??GoofyÂ´s Birdâ??: Goofy finds a lost baby bird, and Mickey helps him bring it back home to its mom in the forest. En route, they feed the baby bird blueberries, keep it warm with a blanket, use a slide to get down the side of a cliff, and Goofy hops on a pogo stick to take the baby bird all the way back to his mom in the tallest tree..
