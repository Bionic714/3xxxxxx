Study of the Fathers has a special place in the Church. The Catechism calls them "models of catechesis" (CCC 8), and "always a timely witness" (CCC 688) to the Tradition of the Church. This CD-ROM allows the viewer to gain an understanding of the Tradition of the Church in an interactive-learning format.
