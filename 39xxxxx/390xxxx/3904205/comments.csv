,hashmotash,2008-06-28T09:09Z,"Great upload. Thank you very much! 

Some more seeding wouldn't go amiss though.  ;-)"
,avarei,2008-12-17T20:39Z,do I burn this in a CD or a DVD? As a data disc or something else? Though I still haven't heard it it seems pretty interesting
,itsnikki123,2008-12-21T20:50Z,Great upload!! Out of the world music! It plays on VLC and in VLC there is an option for 5.1 output (audio-->audio devices). Absolutely tripping stuff
,seeyouaunty,2009-01-11T07:46Z,"avarei:  Assuming you have a DTS capable receiver, all you need to do is rename the .dts files to .wav and burn them as a regular audio cd in nero.  

Then play the cd in your dvd player and it will output the DTS stream over the digital out to your receiver where you should get 5.1 channels of Pink Floyd goodness :-)

Note: if you try to play it in a regular cd player/application you'll just get static."
