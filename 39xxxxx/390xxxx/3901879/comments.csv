,1sh0t1kill,2007-11-22T06:54Z,"So is this one going to require a ""unlock code"" too?"
,Burkao,2007-11-22T07:26Z,"Yes, all City Navigator products do."
,PreDeadMan,2007-11-23T03:22Z,an unlock code what do you mean to the file or something? i'm looking to buy one of these tomorrow at circuitcity will this TOTALLY update it and explain the unlock code thing thank you
,1sh0t1kill,2007-11-23T20:20Z,"BlueBeaver, 

We've been down this road... the unlock code for the ""PC"" is ""DEMO""... which only allows you to mess around with it on your computer. If you upload any 2008 maps to your GPS unit, it will disable the ""GPS"" portion of your unit.... at least, it disabled the GPS on my C330 when I upgraded it. 

With that said, this is a torrent site, we're not partiicipating in this site to make you or Marketman1 or whatever his name is rich. 

I'd buy this program before I'd ever consider giving you a penny. "
,enkiridu,2007-11-23T20:38Z,"Hey 1shot1kill,

What do you mean when you say it locked up the GPS portion of your c330? I just bought one today and wanted to use this to upload new maps and whatnot, but you have me worried. Were you able to fix your unit? Also, I noticed that on the yellow piece of paper that came with the GPS, there is the serial, reg code and unlock code for the unit. When I went to garmin.com to register, they put that unlock code under the MapSource section, saying:

MapSource速 Product
City Navigator North America NT v8 Limited- Deluxe
Region
City Navigator North America NT v8 Limited, Deluxe All Regions, Apr 06

I would assume from that, that it is saying that I am authorized to use that version Limited through Deluxe. Did you try using the unlock code that came with your unit in this program? Thanks."
,1sh0t1kill,2007-11-24T07:58Z,"enkiridu,

I don't have an answer for you in your recent purchase because I haven't been in that situation. However, I did DL the Garmin NT 2008 from here. In the instructions it says to use ""DEMO"" as the code to unlock the NT 2008 in order to access it on your PC computer. ""DEMO"" is exactly that, it lets you play with it on your computer and when you go to ""upload"" it to your unit, it asks if you want to upload in ""DEMO"" mode. I said ""yes"". I did this and apparently part of the set up is to ""disable"" the GPS. I had an SD card in my unit and I believe my NT 2008 maps loaded to that. As soon as I took out the SD card, my GPS began working again. Had me worried for a little bit, but removing the card, fixed my issue. 

If you have City Navigator V8, that's what all C330's come with (I think). If you do indeed have V8 (like I have on my unit) that is the older maps. NT 2008 (this download) is essentially V9 (version 9). 

I messed with the yellow pieces of paper I have from 2, C330 units and my 60CSx. Nothing unlocked the NT 2008 maps. I even looked into:
http://www.geodude.nl/gps/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=2 
to see if this program can do a work around with the maps. I was unsuccessful at getting them to load into my C330, however, I was successful at getting some older maps to load into my 60CSx and provide very accurate routing, which I was having trouble with before using the program at the above link. 

I just wish BlueBeaver would be cool and hook some people up instead of trying to get rich off of Garmin's product. It's one thing to ""acquire"" some software, it's another thing to make $$ off of Garmin's product. "
,saskapoon,2007-11-25T07:03Z,predeadman.... if your buying a gps new from the store you can contact garmin and they're send you your first update free. hope this helps
,wvy,2007-11-25T18:21Z,"I only need a number to use it on my PC (non GPS use). I don't need ""DEMO"" .. 

So, who post a unlock to use this program on PC??

thanks"
,1sh0t1kill,2007-11-25T23:03Z,"I got mine to work for free. Found someone who gave me the code and didn't charge.

,Rock-it Man,2007-11-26T21:39Z,Has anybody bothered to try changing the unlock in the gpsmapsupp.img file?  All you would need to do is replace the fake unlock with yours then transfer it to your SD card.  Would believe you have a different map than the actual data.
,Rock-it Man,2007-11-26T21:51Z,"actually, there is a keygen floating around.  I can try to generate some codes but there's a good chance they will not work.  I also need the map ID to do anything."
,atv,2007-11-26T22:20Z,"Hi everybody!
Why don't u use Metroguide instead of City Navigator? I unstalled V9 on my etrex CX (with other Topo maps) and it runs very good! adresses, poi, all u need. I've also a GPS phone with TomTom6 and this 1 is not better!
Certainly I don't know if Metroguide runs on real car GPS units like n端vixxx, but on Etrex, 60Cx and so on it's perfect!

And I'm not sure who ""Shareall"" is... my guess is that he's using 2 names... and one of them posted an email address. But none-the-less, he seems like a nice enough guy. Others who are able to get thier maps working will probably say so soon. Just my guess though.

,1sh0t1kill,2007-11-28T02:52Z,"Bluebeaver,

Somewhere in all of this, I told you that I appreciated you uploading maps. 

The problem everyone has is that you wanted to make $35 off of each code. I've easily directed 50 people to the free source. If you would have gotten $35 from 50 people.... that's $1750. That is why people were upset with you. 

Keep up the good works with the maps. But don't try and make money off of us just because you had ""access"" to the keygen.

,eric89074,2007-12-18T10:20Z,Thank you for this torrent. I got a nuvi for my sister and I hope I can get this working on it before christmas. If someone can please help me in getting an unlock code I would appreciate it. eric.2@cox.net
,pturc,2007-12-21T12:50Z,What is the map code? Is it 244 like the NT version?
,AxlMyk,2007-12-28T22:22Z,"OK people. Here is how things work.
1. Register your Garmin GPS at www.garmin.com
2. City Nav. NA 2008 is a map UPDATE only.
3. IF you have a registered Garmin GPS and a key for this file, your GPS must be connected to the computer to install it to the GPS.  It will only update Mapsource that is already installed to your computer. It WILL NOT install software to your computer if you don't have it now."
,ChazInMT,2007-12-29T09:02Z,"Don't be discouraged by Axlmyk, his knowledge about this is a bit limited. You do have an option here other than paying Garmin but it does take some perseverance to put all the pieces together.
Pay Garmin, or, hack yer GPS using the tools here and elsewhere for free. 
Thats how it works.  :P

BTW Jets Kg Ver 1.1 isn't working for this, go fish."
,ChazInMT,2008-01-03T05:07Z,"I suppose now that the ""mouse"" is out of the bag, Kg1.3 which has recently been released will make this work well.  Unlock the maps in Mpasource and then upload them to your gps.  In the case of my c330 I have not yet figured out how to hack the internal maps since they don't show up as a USB drive in XP, or vista from what I've read.  I can get these maps on my c330 if I have a blank SD card in the slot. But SD's run $20 and for me, it isn't worth the scant amount of new information I'd be getting in place of the maps that are already in there."
,SunyJim,2008-01-04T20:36Z,"Thanks superpickle, that's all i needed was the mapid, was looking and looking with the hexeditor and just kept coming up with different numbers for this map. once i had that, generated a code, and just went through the unlock wizard twice, once with the gps code, (etrex legend cx)  the other for the map code

Can you message me with what you saw to id that hex in the map file?"
,SunyJim,2008-01-07T09:06Z,"Ok the non-direct to the card.
I've done this with North america 2008, and bluechart 9.5 so it works.
 i have an etrex legend cx. 
I installed the maps to my computer.  Use the reg cracks when there are ones to fool it into thinking that you are just updating. 
Then once it's in... the computer says you must unlock. Use the Jetmouse 1.3 crack with map id, and your device id, run the unlock wizard twice, once to enter the device serial, the other to enter the map serial.  Then that's it, you can choose sections to upload, even parts of one and parts of another, just like unlocked maps."
,Yetties,2008-02-24T02:48Z,"This map file works! Thanks for sharing, Burkao!
I transfered it (Navigator North America 2008) to my c330 successfully by using JetMouse 1.3.
Thanks a great, JetMouse, you rock!
For those can't transfer the map from PC to unit (ex: c3X0), there's a trick that putting a SD into the unit instead of trying to overwrite it, then it will work. Don't try to overwrite to your unit because c330 can't be recognized by Windows as a USB device. Only for those units can be recognized by Windows as a USB device, then you can overwrite it."
,mikatravels,2008-02-27T19:12Z,"This does the thing! Just run ""all.bat"" file and all your maps on your system will get unlocked to use on any device of your choice. No hassle with *.unl files anymore. Worked with all bluecharts, city navigator 9, etc....

,FishV12,2008-02-29T00:01Z,"Is this the NT 2008 full and not the update? If not where can I find it?

Thanks in advance!"
,bootbux,2008-03-15T05:39Z,"Yea, is this the full or the update? Plus is it the NT version or not? 
Garmin breaks its maps into NT(compressed) and Regular (non compressed). 

And Full Version or updating version only (if you have a 2007 installed, you can buy the updated version)

But they must both be either NT or Regular. "

,snowman11,2008-07-02T18:32Z,Just use this http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4050490/Garmin_unlocker.rar as stated before. You just sit back and watch the maps unlock on this program and many others.  Anyone know if there is an update to the maps on this program?  I saw a disc strictly for updating maps for Garmin in Walmart. Anyone seen anything like that here? OR the 2009 Mapsource (not the NT version)?
