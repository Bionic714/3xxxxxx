[T],mt_dew,2007-11-21T13:41Z,Check your settings....key works fine for me.

By the way bobdaslob does not know what he is talking about. Been using Kaspersky for 2 years. Works GREAT

Thank You!"
,kathysmith,2007-11-28T17:58Z,"SO READ THE NOTES! You have to delete your old key before this one will work. Even if it is Blacklisted, it may take some time before it turns off again.

If you want to be sure, delete old key, install this one, and then run the database update program. If it is blacklisted, you will know fairly soon. I just tried this one and it updated fine.

bobdaslob: try setting your update to once a week! Maybe you will last that long! :-)"
,kathysmith,2007-11-28T18:00Z,I take it back. This did indeed blacklist about 5 minutes after it installed. Anyone know what address I can block on my router to stop the check?
,teohhanhui,2007-11-29T14:03Z,This key is blacklisted.
,teohhanhui,2007-12-29T12:23Z,"Expires: 4th January 2008
Status: Blacklisted"
,depicted_by_affliction,2007-12-29T17:41Z,"Kaspersky, is possibly the best antivirus program. It's constantly updated, i mean hourly, and its very lightweight, unlike other Symantech programs. But what pisses me off is the fact that Kaspersky are SO quick to detect duplicate keys and blacklist them within months, weeks or even days. Longest key I've had work was for 8 months, back in '06 since then keys are harder to find and when found you're pretty lucky if it works for more than a month or two. It seems as Kaspersky done a lot of blacklisting this month, i read somewhere that over 200 keys have were black listed, true or not is debatable. Seems as if 'ol kaspersky wants us ta have to pay for internet protection, protection from people we don't even know or never botherd..."
