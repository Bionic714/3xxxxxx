[T],FatFreddy475,2007-11-21T16:33Z,"Do u really think he'd say it's fake if it was??!
I don't believe it's a fake, it's already been uploaded, same name, same size. Go here:

,Ordeal,2007-11-21T23:04Z,Considering how much he/she has uploaded i'd say it's not fake

,atom224,2007-11-22T23:02Z,nearly every new game uses some type of server side authentication.  Only lan play is available for most of these.  Or cracked servers.  This has been the case for many years.  You may have to buy it.
