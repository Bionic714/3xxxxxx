As for ""the rest of season 3"", it does not exist really. They never did release on DVD so the last 20 episodes of the last season of Jem are only available through YouTube or some sellers who probably copied their copy of their old VHS tapes to DVD. 

You see, Rhino was bought out by Sony before it had the chance to release that set. And Sony doesn't particularly care about releasing it or the other sets that were released. So technically, it's out of print, etc."

I just need a seeder, I promise that I will see it more than one time !!"
