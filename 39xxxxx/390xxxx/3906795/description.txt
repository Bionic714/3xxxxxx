I uploaded this before on Demonoid, but it died :(

So this is Jem and the Holograms, the first half of the third season. These episodes were ripped from DVD. Each one is around 180mb in size and 640x480 pixels, around 23 frames per second. Stereo sound, not surround. Encoded in Xvid, et cetera.

Enjoy =)
