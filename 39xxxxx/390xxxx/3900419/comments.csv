,Lark_Prof,2007-12-17T03:08Z,Woah. This isn't quite season 2. You have the last 4 episodes from season one as season 2's first four episodes. and your missing the last 3 episodes from season two. I wonder if there was a regional difference in episodes to seasons.

,Umbra366,2008-02-06T22:30Z,"Actually, he is somewhat right.

The DVD for season one is actually labeled ""Volume One"", which contains all of season one and also the first four of season two (A Flight to Remember, Mars University, ect.)"

,_Rarr,2008-06-16T16:28Z,"Yes, the American Seasons are different to the European ""Season"". For instance, the UK has only 4 ""Seasons"" while there are 5 Seasons in the US, bot our ""Season 1"" is basically a combination of Season 1 and 2.

It's the same with Family Guy.

So nyuh :P"
