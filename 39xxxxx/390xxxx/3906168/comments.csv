If anyone has finished this, please seed... I will seed to 3.00 ... This is the best movie trilogy ever. It beats Star Wars ..."

,slbm70,2008-01-26T00:30Z,"thanks for this. Much appreciated.

However - unfortunately, with no subtitles it is extremely hard to follow (the subtleties, not the gist)."

,bmasseur,2008-06-16T19:01Z,"These english subtitles line up with this rip perfectly: http://www.moviesubtitles.org/subtitle-6498.html

be a little self-sufficient people. It's called Google. God created it for a reason.

And if Jimmy the supposed Gent wasn't trying to rip off Sukka's work, then he wouldn't have bothered to tag his torrents, why do you care? The service is appreciated, but don't be a dick about it.

Sukka, thanks for the upload and your effort in ripping this film. Why do you give a fuck if Jimmy ripped off your shit?"
,CAS91572,2008-06-29T07:15Z,"ok here's links to english subs:

,n4rce17,2008-08-28T14:57Z,how do i install those subs? pls help..
,genti33,2008-08-28T21:46Z,"a bit dissapointing for the quality....
i would recomend to download another torrent if ur looking for good shit :P

cheers anyway"
,john_john_john,2008-09-18T09:01Z,"guys there is a sub pack link in the info section http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4380681. i just wanted to know if the sub pack works.

don't wanna download this and find out the subs aren't right"
,doubledge,2008-09-29T11:01Z,"HAVING TROUBLE WITH SUBTITLES?
HERE'S WHY:

The subtitles need to be re-named to be EXACTLY the same as their AVI counterpart.

IE: ""The godfather 1 english.sub""  needs to be re-named to: ""God father part I.sub"" 
( MINUS QUOTATION MARKS - ***Notice the SPACE between ""God"" and ""father"" - this is the only one with the space...).

The rest should read:
""Godfather part II.sub"" and
""Godfather part III.sub""

ALSO: You'll get better response from ""DirectVobSub"" if you put each movie and associated subtitle file in it's own folder.

That is, of course, if you've got the
""DirectVobSub - (auto-loading version)"" plug-in installed.

If you don't, download ""Combined Community Codec Pack (C.C.C.P. - Google it - it's free).

TOOK ME A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS HERE. 
THIS SOLUTION WORKS FOR ME,
HOPE IT HELPS SOME OF YOU!

PEACE,

,Sukkanaama,2008-10-05T21:05Z,"Or if you have problems with subtitles you migth try VLC Media Player:
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
wich has most codec built-in so you don't need external programs... I use it and it's great.

,tombration,2008-10-31T01:06Z,Kiitti kundi! ;)
,_043,2008-12-02T08:36Z,"It appears that there are no proper English subtitles for the second movie - some of them go out of sync by the middle of the film, some don't have all the Italian parts subtitled. At least I didn't find any good subtitles, and I really tried, so I'll download another rip."

,MikeQuest3,2009-02-08T07:18Z,"Hello,  one general question as couldnt find the answer on the forums.
Has anybody noticed that all 3 movies are exactly 7-8 mins short from the actual runtime, are some of the scenes chopped off or is it because its been 'ripped' that way. any answers?"
,Sukkanaama,2009-02-14T10:47Z,They are full movie rips and nothing is ripped... Maybe you are looking at directors cuts?
,ridethelightning87,2009-05-30T12:32Z,never seen these movies thanks for the upload
