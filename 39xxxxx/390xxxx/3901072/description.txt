* Broadcast title> Dispatches -  Mark Thomas on Coca Cola

Political activist and journalist Mark Thomas travels to South America, India and the US to investigate the way in which Coca-Cola and its suppliers operate and the extent to which they upholds moral and ethical obligations.

Coca-Cola is one of the most iconic brands of both the 20th and 21st centuries. Promoting itself as the drink of freedom, choice and US patriotism, the company's feel-good factor is recognized worldwide and reflected in its enormous profits.

But behind this carefully crafted image exists a company accused of environmental damage, human rights violations and questionable business practices.

In the program we go on journey from the company?s days with a cocaine ingredient, its close collaboration with Nazis, a history of discrimination against black workers, alignment death squads and murder in Colombia, child labor in El Salvador and the depredation of vital water supplies in India and elsewhere. 

At the end of the program, we are tantalized by possible flirtations with neuro-marketing and the undoubted power of its branding and advertising appeal. 

Thomas, a long-term critic of Coca-Cola's more controversial practices, finds disturbing evidence which undermines its effervescent image as a force for good and which has prompted a global consumer backlash. (Enhanced combo description )
