Enjoy!

I am happy to share all my collection with you!

I very much appreciate all the efforts that you are deploying to keep the Fu alive by seeding these torrents, whenever possible and with the means that you have at your disposal, and I sincerely thank you all.

Together, let's keep the Fu alive, REGARDLESS OF THE CARYING BOAT!

If you happen to be an active seeder, please drop your hotmail email address so that other Fu Members could contact you for a possible reseed."
,coolfoolpaul,2007-11-23T21:02Z,"Hi James

Is this english subbed at all?

Thx"
,JamesKees,2007-11-24T05:37Z,"Hi,

Not at all. There are no English subs on this one. It's chinese mainland release.

Cheers"

,JamesKees,2007-11-24T12:35Z,"Hi Marc,

I often include a file called ""Read Me First"" on uploaded torrent. Its has a short section explaining how to have the subtitles displayed. Here is an excerpt:
---
1. How to have the subtitles displayed in RMVB movies?

Download and install DirectVobSub (http://www.free-codecs.com/download/DirectVobSub.htm)

Two separate ways:

1.1.
Download and install ""Real Alternative 1.5.1 (Media Player Classic)""
(http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Real_Alternative.htm)
During the installation, DO NOT REMOVE REALPLAYER IF ALREADY INSTALLED,
IF NOT INSTALLED YET, INSTALL REALPLAYER AFTER HAVING INSTALLED REAL ALTERNATIVE,
AS REALPLAYER HAS THE NECESSARY VIDEO CODECS FOR RMVB FILES.

From the ""Real Alternative"" (Media Player Classic) menu, navigate to and ensure that the ""Show Subtitles"" submenu is selected:
Menu: Play -> Filters -> DirectVobSub (Auto-loading version) -> Show Subtitles
Open the movie file using ""Real Alternative"" (Media Player Classic), the subtitles automatically display.

1.2.
Once you have downloaded the rmvb movie file with separate subtitles file, just change the 
extension only of the downloaded file from .rm(vb) to .avi (not convert,
just change the filename extension);
Open the movie file using RealPlayer 10.xx, DirectVobSub will load the subtitles automatically.
---

Basically, you need to have DirectVobSub installed on your computer (http://www.free-codecs.com/download/DirectVobSub.htm)

Hope it help !

Cheers,
James Kees"

,mzungu700,2007-11-29T14:23Z,"Hi.

I've followed your instructions to get subtitles but without success. I've got Direct VobSub, Real Player, Classic Media Player etc but it doesn't work. Any idea what I might have done wrong? "
,Zerotrust,2007-11-29T17:45Z,hi all just a quick comment regarding the subs i´ve had to many problems with vobsub so instead get the movie player called gom player its free as good as vlc and if you need a codec it will find it for you and about the subs it uses drag and drop just a tip best player i ever seen
,katana96,2007-11-30T19:53Z,"Hi,

Also, where are the others getting English sub files from?

,JamesKees,2007-12-01T22:44Z,"Greetings to you svartevarg,

Long time no hear!

We are now sailing on a different ship on the dark waters of file sharing until 'noid return if it will.

Good to hear from you !"
,svartevarg,2007-12-02T23:43Z,"We are now sailing on a different ship, James....

But those dark waters of filesharing will always be the same for us to sail....no matter the difficulties arisen....

Hope to go on this way all together as one..."

Marc Rützou,

Use VLC. Its free. Download here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html

It doesn't require complicated codecs, or other stuff. It handles any regular video format.
Because it doesn't need codecs, it doesn't mess up your computer so the rest keeps working the way it did."
,barryke,2007-12-06T01:12Z,"However, real player fileformats suck. I hope someone reencodes all, then i'll download. :)"
,isflak,2007-12-06T21:30Z,"Hey James, where the hell do you get so many films?? o_o"
,edward41890,2007-12-31T08:41Z,I am currently downloading this series i was wondering what language is it in canto or mandarin??? TY for the torrent!
,Pleyades,2008-11-15T20:29Z,"I all ready download 87% of fearless. I can see episode #1, but I cant see any other episode. what is wrong. thanks. keep the Fu alive."
,Pleyades,2008-11-18T19:47Z,"James, I am currently downloading this torrent, but for several days no seeders at all. Please seed
thanks"
,malachi2,2009-08-06T01:24Z,"James Kee, can you please re-seed this interesting series.  For your information, I am stuck at 97.6% for quite sometimes already.

Recently I had noted that there are 4 Leechers but no Seeders.  Can you or someone re-seed this torrent?  Thank you very much!!!!"
,vo_danh,2011-02-01T10:04Z,"""1.2.

Which means the subtitles are NOT included in this pack. The directions tell you how to load subtitles, but doesn't provide them in this pack. The ""seperate subtitle"" files are not included, and they are not imbedded in these rmvb files. Thanks for the upload. If someone finds english subtitles for this please link them to us."
