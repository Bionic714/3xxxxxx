Fearless aka Huo Yuan Jia (Ekin Cheng, Jordan Chan, 2007) - Rmvb, Episodes 01-42

Larger-than-life martial arts hero Huo Yuan Jia, who was embodied by Jet Li in the 2006 blockbuster Fearless, now comes to the small screen in the highly anticipated Mainland TV drama Huo Yuan Jia. Reuniting after their Young and Dangerous days, Hong Kong stars Ekin Cheng and Jordan Chan fight for a higher cause as kung fu icons Huo Yuan Jia and Chen Zheng. Ekin Cheng did his fair share of action period dramas in the 1990s with TVB, and he handles his action scenes with surprising skill and convince in Huo Yuan Jia. This is Cheng's first Mainland drama in his long career, and he even shaved his trademark locks for the role. Huo Yuan Jia also marks a first for renowned Hong Kong director Stanley Kwan, who served as art director for the drama, ensuring that the mood matches the action, choreographed by Ku Huen Chiu. The drama is written by Hong Kong screenwriter Chan Kiu Ying, who penned many of TVB's classic dramas including Legend of the Condor Heroes and Shanghai Bund. 

Huo Yuan Jia revolves around Cheng's titular hero, who comes of age during the waning days of the Qing Dynasty. With the country weakened by constant foreign infringement, Chinese people suffer unfair treatment from foreigners in their own homeland. After seeing his friend get beaten to death, Huo realizes that he must help strengthen China through martial arts, creating his own kung fu style and dueling against foreign challengers. His cause is aided by Jordan Chan's Chen Zheng, a fictional hero that attained iconic status through Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury and was also portrayed by Donnie Yen in an ATV drama. Here, Jordan Chan creates a more mischievous character that suits his acting style and helps lighten the drama. Uplifting and packed with action, Huo Yuan Jia is a grand drama about brotherhood, courage, patriotism, and the essence of martial arts.
