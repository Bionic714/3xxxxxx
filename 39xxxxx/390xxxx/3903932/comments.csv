,Larshino,2007-12-02T09:58Z,Hmm i cant even unpack it with WinRar or ZipReader. :/   (any Tip?)
,Shadie_19,2007-12-06T18:14Z,i downloaded the game installed great but when i go to play it it keeps saying insert cd 
,micarone,2007-12-07T07:24Z,"Larshino : You're not supposed to unpack it at all becuase it's a ISO-file... You'll need a whole different program(s) for it. WinISO, PowerISO, Alcohol 120% or similar to those three.

Shadie : Search from http://www.gamecopyworld.com for a No-CD Patch."

,rfolo,2008-09-13T11:38Z,"I put the no cd patch where in the correct place, but now my game wont boot up at all :( help?"
,dkoda,2009-04-16T00:02Z,hi micarone will u plz tell how to install this game.. bcoz many of us having problem in installing this one. thank u....
,Jim_Morrison_1944,2009-05-22T18:28Z,"Right. Here's how you make a .iso file work for you.

Download Daemon Tools or PowerISO as advised earlier in this comment thread by others. Google Daemon or PowerISO - don't ask for links! Google is your friend...lol Install the program, and when you're installing it, make sure you choose to allow the program to minimise to your system tray (the thingy with the time in the bottom right hand corner of your screen).

When you've done this, right-click on the icon (should be a silver or gold disc in the bottom right-hand corner) and click on set number of drives - choose 1, or however many virtual drives you want.

When you've done this, right click again on the silver or gold disc icon in the bottom right corner, and choose the top option (mount image to drive H: or whatver letter it's assigned...E:, F:, G:, Z:, whatever). Then just browse through your C: Drive to wherever you downloaded the .ISO file and left-click on it, and press open. You have now mounted the .ISO image.

When you've done this, go to 'My Computer' or 'Computer' or whatever your machine calls it. Open it and you'll see an extra drive. Right click on the new drive, and choose 'explore' or 'open'. Hey presto, a shit-load of files. Choose 'setup.exe' or the nearest thing to a setup.exe file, and follow any instructions contained within this .ISO.

There may be a 'readme.txt.' file, or a readme in .nfo format to further assist you. You can read .nfo files by right-clicking on them and choosing 'Open With' following by notepad.exe (which you can find in C:\Windows\System32 if you're feeling brave enough to explore your Windows files! lol).

I know it's not easy when you first do this kind of thing, but be patient, try to be logical, and you will succeed. I was until relatively recently a total luddite with no clue about how PC's work. No-one else taught me but myself. The one thing I never do on Pirate Bay or other site is write 'seed' a hundred times over, and when I can't get something to work, I don't write 'this doesn't work' or 'fake' or any other rubbish like that, because 99% of the time, it's my stupidity, not the kind person doing the upload!

Hope this helps."
