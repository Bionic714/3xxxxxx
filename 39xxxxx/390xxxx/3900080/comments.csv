,leviticus12,2007-11-19T23:36Z,Can I have a response if people can download? I've got a share ratio right now of 5.0 or so - but Azureus and TPB aren't showing any active seeds or leeches. Thanks!
,raindr0ps,2007-11-20T06:37Z,"I had a bitch of time with Azureus. About 28K was my best dl speed. Too many options. Too many of everything. All I wanted to do was DL. I'm not trying to badmouth Azureus; it just wasn't my cup of tea. Dumped it and switched to Utorrent. Easy as can be. Installed in seconds, no configuration, nothing. Right out of the box it DL at up to 280K. Azureus is probably a great program for those who want to tweak settings but if that isn't for you, you might try another torrent program.
Please, all you Azureus diehards, don't flame me over my comments. Different strokes for different folks. OK?"

,leviticus12,2007-12-13T03:09Z,"I would suggest the torrent here:
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3910043/World_Without_End__by_Ken_Follett._(Ebook_-_English)

A pdf file, with acceptable formatting. The formatting on this version was a bit wonky.
