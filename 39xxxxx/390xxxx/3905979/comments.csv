,paulhite,2007-11-24T06:57Z,cbz and cbr are standard formats for comics... as standard as mp3 or flac for music.  You can rename xyz.cbz to xyz.zip and then unzip it.  You can rename abc.cbr to abc.rar and then unrar it.  In either case you then have a bunch od jpg images of the pages.  But you really should leave it as it is and download a comic book reader program.
