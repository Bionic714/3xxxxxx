Review:
I'll tell you straight off -- there's nothing hot in Summer Heat.

First of all, the main character Masato has about as much personality as a dead fish. The guy is a snivelling loser! He looks okay enough, but he's so spineless and dense that I found myself wanting to slap him silly. It's completely understandable why most of the sex he gets are in his imagination. Yet things happen rather conveniently for Masato. His dream girl Chihiru suddenly pops out of nowhere and rekindles their friendship. She's coincidentally around and free when Masato thinks of asking her out. She also dumps her super wealthy, handsome, and influential suitor for pathetic ol' Masato. And get this: Masato's rival is the very person who tells Masato to go to Chihiru because she prefers him. D-oh!!! Masato is so clueless that things have to be spelled out for him every time.

Then there's the sex. Everything is shown from top to bottom, but the details aren't so good. The lower genital areas are crudely drawn, and the hairs look like someone's mustache. It was kind of funny. The art and animation range from a little bad to average fare. The characters are depicted adequately but there are times when their movements are jerky. The English dubbing is passable at best. Some of the voices are okay for the characters, while some are just irritating to listen to. Let's just say that if you want something hot, you definitely don't want Summer Heat. Well... at least it didn't put me to sleep.

YMMV"
