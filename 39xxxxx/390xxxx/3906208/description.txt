I have put into this torrent some songs that I like a lot.

I've received a lot from the pirate comunity, so it is now time to give something in return.

Well, this is my first torrent. And I just wanted to learn the process of creating a torrent and uploading it.
You can expect a lot of good stuff from the pirate_son.

Very soon you'll get from me:
-My whole mp3 collection (which includes: nirvana, and the all grunge that you can imagine.)
-My software collection (Which includes: lots of useful programs with keygens)
-All the rest: music videos, e-books, many more

The idea is to set up an internet site where you can see all my files in a very organized way, so you can search whatever you want, and then go to pirate bay and download the respective torrent.

I hope it all works fine.
