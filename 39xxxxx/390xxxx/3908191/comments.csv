Enjoy. :D"
,hot_soup,2008-03-08T20:12Z,This is a nice prog with lots of features but it's a CPU hog!  It uses like 70-100% of my Core 2 2Ghz!  CamUniversal has most of the same features and only uses 20-30% but I can't find a crack for it >:-o

,Mistyguy,2008-10-12T16:20Z,"Yes, i wanna confirm again files works fine!! But ""OrganShifter"" i have one more question.
If it ask for update to 10. X..  If i do that it will start with demo  again. Does it mean it cannot be updated??  am i correct Organshifter?? ( or any one?) "
,organshifter,2008-11-16T03:59Z,"Thxz jmc3186. Couldn't have stated better myself :D.

Well, Mistyguy, I used this same patching process with 10.0 and it worked. However, after some time, the application reverts back to trial on its own. Way too annoying for me to deal with, so I decided to stick with 9.9 as it does everything I need."
,yy4u,2008-12-10T04:59Z,"Works great.  Thx.  
If you have avast, you will have to stop it to run the keygen... even if you say ""ignore' when it finds it.  It gives a Windows file error and states that you may not have permission.  Just pause it.  
Thx again organshifter.  Nice prog. "

,jamesvdm,2009-03-11T08:02Z,program still attempts to register itself with patch applied. process times out and reg not successful
,organshifter,2009-03-16T20:13Z,"Just to clear things up, there isn't any type of viruses/Trojans within the keygen. If you are new to the world of patches, keygens, or fixes, I don't know what to tell you. Anyone who has been a part of the wares scene for years can tell you that any of the above work-arounds are quite often detected by Antivirus programs as threats. These are called ""False Positives"".

I have the application installed and use it everyday.

@ jamesvdm, if the program is still trying to connect, click on Tool from the top of the program, and from the drop-down menu, uncheck ""Check for Upgrade"". That will stop it from trying to connect to PY Software.

@ hot4me, when you start the keygen, the ""Patch Network"" button is right at the bottom next to the ""World-wide-license"" drop down menu.

See here (Screenshot Taken 3-16-2009):

BTW, I keep the Keygen rar'd in its own little, password protected package. Otherwise, Kaspersky keeps bugging me about it being a threat. I'm not worried and know it's a False Positive because I was using it long before PY Software submitted the Keygen to Kaspersky as a threat. Kaspersky has since updated their definitions to detect it as such.

To each their own. I'm enjoying the app myself.

,dm30001,2009-04-06T01:07Z,"i agree with organshifter. anyways this program freezes my pc after maybe 3-4 hours of time...all my stuff is uptodate and virus free..im thinking its a hardware issue with the webcam and and pc

i got nv!dia 8800 and those cheap 5 dolla webcams on webcam (usb webcam pc 168) 

but other than that this is great program and you should buy. k bye."
,SpiffyMasta,2009-05-23T18:44Z,"organshifter this is a great torrent! But how do I get it out of stealth mode?? I've made it completely invisible but now I can't figure out how to get it out of it.

HELP!!"
,telx09,2009-05-23T19:01Z,"Works a treat thank you
I had to run keygen in windows safe mode to crack but its very simple to use.

Thanks again organshifter"
,organshifter,2009-07-06T21:49Z,"Very welcome guys. :)

@ SpiffyMasta, (Sorry for the delayed response.)

Once the program is set to stealth mode & completely invisible, you'll need to run it again from the start menu in order for it to open. I run mine in stealth mode as well, along with password protection. When I need to display the app again, I run it from the start menu. I am then greeted with a password prompt. Entering my password and clicking OK opens the application.

I'm sure you've already figured that out. ;)"
,ngeegai7,2009-09-16T10:37Z,Was having second thought on whether I do really need this program... but after reading through the comments and found that you did a darn good job in answering the technical issues... so much better than some of the companies I got my licensed software! I can't stop but download it and leave a comment and oH hey... I luv you o.shifter... the company should hire you as their advisor... *chuckle*
,Vulcan262,2009-10-27T07:53Z,"Good download, but took a few tries with the patch and install to get it to stop unregistering the program, followed the instructions, and deleted the unregister.exe, it now seems to be working except that when I try to click on the drop down to set the sound setup, the program crashes, but no problem, as long as I get video, that works for the surveillance I need, just wish the sound would work too, It would be cool to hear who is at the door as well as see them. All in all, not a bad program."
,knightallan,2009-11-02T12:01Z,"hi! just dropping by to comment.  I havn't thanked the uploader or who ever is the source of the software with the patch.

THANK YOU!

this software really is a charm.  it's almost 2 years already & I have installed it with many computers.... and oh man!  i can monitor 15 different broadcasts of 9 different locations. well of course I have to use a little bit faster PC for the master/main computer (C2Q 3.2Ghz, 8GB RAM, 1GB Video DDR3, 1TB Hard disk, and fast internet connection)  ...the rest are a dozen of cheap web/pc cameras and surplus/junk PC that could run win xp.

I recommend this software!

Thank you once again!   hehehehee.....
(sorry, I should have commented a year ago...lol...)"
,no1gamer,2009-11-09T00:59Z,"Hey Organshifter thanks for the great program! I have one of those 8 camera cards and was having a tough time getting an app to show the feeds. THIS IS THE BEST... and the virus that most anti virus software shows IS a false positive. I hate to say things more than once but in this case its worth it...this is the best, Thanks"
,valeriym,2009-12-09T23:20Z,"Ughh...i believe that this works, but i have the new avg and it doesnt let me turn it off haha. I cant turn off avg and everytime i try to open the keygen it says that thing even if i click ""ignore"" idk. I'll try to shut off avg. But usually when its a keygen it shows the virus name as ""keygen.blablabla"" but this time it says its a trojan..?"
