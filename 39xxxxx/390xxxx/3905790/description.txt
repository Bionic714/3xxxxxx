Lady Snowblood 1, Blizzard From The Netherworld (1973) - Rmvb

HKFlix Says: 
 
An unforgettable revenge flick with a terrific, ultraviolent style. Clearly a strong inspiration for the film "Kill Bill". 

Avg. Rating:  4.4 / 5 (based on 5 ratings).

Plot: A prisoner becomes pregnant and has a child for one purpose: to carry out her revenge after death. She leaves instructions with an inmate for the child's upbringing: forget joy, forget sorrow, forget love and hate, forget everything except vengeance. 
 
Overview: 1874, the year of the Meiji era. A child of the netherworld is born for vengeance. Her name is Yuki Kashima, to be known as Lady Snowblood. She is called Snowblood because the snow that cleanses the decay of the netherworld is not pure white but fiery red. 
She is conceived in jail where her mother is imprisoned for murder. Her mother, Sayo, has behaved (in her own words) like a bitch in heat, having sex with all the male prisoners and wardens available, for one purpose: to conceive a male child to carry on her revenge after death. But one snowy night she gives birth to a baby girl named Yuki (Snow). In giving birth, she dies, leaving instructions with one of her fellow inmates regarding the child's upbringing. 

Her mother, Sayo, seeks to avenge the slaughter of her husband and her own multiple rape and torture. Four people are responsible. By the time of Yuki's birth, one has already paid for his crimes with his life. Three remain. Yuki Kashima is an instrument of her mother's will. She is taught by her brutal instructor "you have a destiny: forget joy, forget sorrow, forget love and hate, forget everything except vengeance."
