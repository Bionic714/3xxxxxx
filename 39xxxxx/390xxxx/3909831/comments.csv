[T],aladin4u,2007-11-26T15:00Z,"Sorry, bubblestar:)
Guys, instead of downloading this piece of shit, you do the following:


1. Download Little Snitch 2.0 from 
http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html

2. Install it and quit it.

3. Delete the file: 
/Library/Application Support/Objective Development/Little Snitch/registration_2 

4. Start Little Snitch. 

5. Enter the new [SN] ==>32SPUMGU50-718LH-JKMW49FNRS


Good luck guys. Man (@bubblestar) I beg your pardon."
,bigginger,2007-11-26T17:07Z,"Because it's easier/quicker and doesn't involve running with Snitch turned off, exposing your puter/progs to the big wide world?"
,cammac2000,2007-11-26T17:27Z,"thx for posting

sorry offtopic: can anyone seed filemaker 9 mac?"
,Jadocs,2007-11-26T20:19Z,"I've read that Little Snitch does funny things when hacked with a SN#

Anyone confirm or deny?"
,spaceman3010,2007-11-26T22:50Z,"it shows that it accepts the SN but after 3 hours it turns itself off, so eventually doesn't work with a hacked sn"
,Jadocs,2007-11-26T23:04Z,"Interesting, are you able to turn it back on?"
,bubblestar,2007-11-26T23:54Z,"What the hell are you people talking about? Indeed I had to reactivate little snitch every 3 hours with the beta 10 serial, very irritating... Run the installer, uninstall little snitch 2.0, don't worry it will keep your rules intact. Then reinstall and activate with the new serial. Voila, Little Snitch works, just like that already for 3 days, never had to reactivate... my god..."
,Jadocs,2007-11-27T01:09Z,"bubblestar,  Here is the deal.  When you install 2.0 off the website and enter the SN provided above (32SPUMGU50-718LH-JKMW49FNRS), Spaceman says it turns off after 3 hours.  What would uninstalling and reinstalling do?  Is there a different SN# you are using to prevent it from turning off?  Or do you have to input a beta SN, then uninstall and put in the SN listed above?  If so what is the beta SN?"
,Jadocs,2007-11-27T01:25Z,"ok, I think I understand what is happening here:  32SPUMGU50-718LH-JKMW49FNRS that is listed above is the beta SN.  bubblestar is saying to input the SN included in his torrent which will fix the 3hr shut off.

Is that correct?

Thanks"
,DEATHMOVE,2007-11-27T02:52Z,what's wrong with you people? bubblestar's upload is not shit. this works and it don't turn off. 
,bubblestar,2007-11-27T04:46Z,Thank you deathmove...
[T],aladin4u,2007-11-27T06:22Z,"What the fuck are you doing men?! Oh, my God! Fuck! I've explained how to activate this piece of LITTLE SHIT. Follow the instruction and enjoy!

P.S.: Tell 'em the truth bro! (Don't get angry - we're brothers!)"
,l2uso,2007-11-27T08:37Z,"@aladin4u@

Ok, let's think just for a second you are right, because the file to delete is the right one and it is a valid code so, please, explain to us why the ""LITTLE SHIT"", as you named, simply shutdown at 3 hours of use?

I'll download this file only to see if there is a valid code inside it, and if this is true, I sorry to tell you bro that you are the one that have writen a piece of shit.

BTW, you are asking us to follow the rules and your are the one who broke the rules in the first place, because you are posting a serial code so, please, ""Don't get angry - we're brothers!""

Anyhow, thank you for the instructions and thank you bubblestar for the app."
[T],aladin4u,2007-11-27T14:48Z,"@l2uso(uso=lie?)
Maybe you are right, but my Little Snitch is workin well. No ""3 hour shut-down"", no bugs. Just brilliant.  
Sorry bubblestar if i said smth wrong. "

,s3ct0r3,2007-12-04T05:31Z,"aladin4u made a nice effort .. thanks, but this torrent is correct.

You supplied us with an expired BETA serial. I believe this gets you a ... gtfo, but I'll be nice.

bubblestar, you're right?you deserve a cross-shaped cookie with the crucified Jesus right on the front.

Thank you,

IT WORKS - DOWNLOAD IT AND KILL CAPITOLISM

,michas22,2007-12-06T19:13Z,Is it safe to use it with serial from torrent with 2.0.1 version ?
,Beatrice5,2007-12-08T12:04Z,"""Is it safe to use it with serial from torrent with 2.0.1 version ?""

No. We need a new serial."
,michas22,2007-12-08T12:53Z,Beatrice5: Are you sure ? :(
,Beatrice5,2007-12-08T13:13Z,"Beatrice5: Are you sure ? :(

Yes, after 3 hours Little Snitch says demo over. So I have gone back to the final 2.0 version."
,synthesis95,2007-12-20T20:03Z,"Not work correctly ! the serial is bad.
after 3 hours is return to demo mode."
,UncleUnko,2007-12-21T16:43Z,"Yup!  Bad serial!   Some one smart please write a SerGen for this...  Pleeeeez!

,Jerk990,2008-01-09T16:31Z,"when a hack SN# is put in Little Snitch phones home, and tells you that your being protected but it still lets everything through, pay for this one, it will protect you from things you didnt pay for"
,mrdouble,2008-01-28T02:40Z,"not sure what you guys are talking about,  but I used the serial aladin4u posted on the 3hr one I DLed from site and it worked great!@"
,Beatrice5,2008-01-30T12:31Z,"Hi mrdouble, serial aladin4u posted on the 3hr one!! What serial no would that be then? Pleassse advise...."

,packhater,2008-02-05T00:23Z,kcn's not up here yet  :) where is it?
,grrrnola,2008-02-07T19:45Z,"do what aladin suggested and download the trial version from the official website and use the key: 

32SPUMGU50-718LH-JKMW49FNRS

i also did this while not connected to the internet, though i don't know if that makes a difference."
,grrrnola,2008-02-09T20:22Z,update: it actually stays running in demo mode even though it registers the serial.
,Beatrice5,2008-02-17T12:57Z,"Try serial:

32SDBWP990-734NW-6GGJZKFCSJ

I can verify that it works with ver 2.0.2

Don't forget to delete the ""Objective Development"" foler in application support!

"
,leagaloo,2008-04-05T20:32Z,"Bad App,, this app is works to good, you`ll wil start to hateing all the warnings.. And When you finaly cofigured all it all, if you have a reboot they will all disapere..

Like a f virus!!

Wait til thers a update!!"
,sonambula,2008-04-06T05:23Z,"Do any of these serials work with 2.0.3? Thanks
"
,supppp,2008-11-23T22:59Z,"people are so retarded, yeah it says it registered it. But, for a company who makes a product to stop the programs from connecting to the internet, do you really think they are stupid enough to accept just any serial number? they know exactly what people are trying to do. they say it's registered, when really it isn't. and the ""demo expiration"" log, is really fucking annoying"
,domdomtom,2009-10-01T14:52Z,Just stop little snitch from accessing the internet itself
