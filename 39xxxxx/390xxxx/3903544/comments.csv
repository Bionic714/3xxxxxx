,reggiebush,2008-01-10T01:21Z,"i dl'ed the torrent.
unplugged my internet.

then, registered, opened keygen, put in code.

make sure to NOT allow the program to connect to the internet. also, in the settings, make sure to NOT allow automatic upgrades, and DO NOT ALLOW it to send burning data to the developer.

OR just have your firewall block the program from accessing the internet.

anyways, this worked for me BRILLIANTLY.

Nice Job BTGuy!
Thanks for saving me 50$!"
