,PeterAichinger,2007-12-18T10:41Z,Anyone know how to open this file? I have sound but no video. (Opened with Winamp.)
,PeterAichinger,2007-12-18T12:19Z,"Tried other players and came to the conclusion that it is a codec problem. Unfortunately I can not find out which codec I need. Gspot is not very informative this time.

Any suggestion?"
,wzeek,2007-12-21T20:02Z,"All mp4 or m4v pr m4a can be played using itunes or quicktime. You can also try VLC by videolan. 
VLC plays almost all types of formats."
,fivepoundfilms,2008-01-02T22:08Z,ANY CHANCE OF THE OTHER PROGRAMMES IN THE SERIES? What a great series. Thanks
,PeterAichinger,2008-01-15T04:48Z,Thx for your answer wzeek. Tried VLC but it plays only sound as all the other players I tried. Will give it a try with Quicktime and iTunes. Will let you know if it worked.
,PeterAichinger,2008-03-09T00:11Z,"I tried Quicktime and iTunes but with both I got the first frame (BBC with a shelf of books) and than it stucks. Sound goes on but not the image.

I would be very glad if I could watch this documentary, maybe somebody who watched it (or the original encoder?) could tell me what codec I need."
,cmpb377,2008-04-04T02:09Z,"Hi. I d/led this whole series from another site and had exactly the same problem, and another problem...when using Nero it gave me video and no sound!!! I ended up doing 2 things. First, I converted them to DVD-VOB in Xilisoft's Video Converter and burnt them to disc. Then I remembered I had ConvertXtoDVD which I hardly ever use, and so just to experiment I tried that too. It worked. You'll have to sacrifice a few discs to watch them all, but it's well worth it. Top series. I liked them so much I even bought the book that goes with it... Good luck. "
,PeterAichinger,2009-07-13T23:45Z,"Finally I could watch them.

What is the title of the book? Maybe you can put it here onto PB?"
