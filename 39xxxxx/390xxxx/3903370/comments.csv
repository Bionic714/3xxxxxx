Thanks a lot for this!"
,Landslyde,2007-11-22T00:20Z,I love you.
,mystiemus,2007-11-22T00:33Z,"It's completely stand-alone, and 100% compatible with any current Guardian's License, if you play online."
,RickyC011,2007-11-22T00:53Z,How come this is around the same size as original? Is it compressed?
,mystiemus,2007-11-22T01:09Z,"Uhm, no clue.  All I did was take Nero and make an ISO straight from the DVD, and my test with Daemon Tools says it works just fine.

The box still only says it takes 9gb, which is the same as the original box, so my guess is the games are just roughly the same size."
,RickyC011,2007-11-22T01:12Z,Well thanks for this :D
,Koopani,2007-11-22T01:13Z,you are a god among PSU players
,mystiemus,2007-11-22T01:22Z,"Hey, no problem ^^ Hope you all enjoy.

Since I was an idiot and didn't put it in the title or description, and don't know how to change 'em (newbie at work!), some small info:

This is the expansion pack to Phantasy Star Universe, entitled ""Ambition of the Illuminus.""
It is 100% standalone, and does NOT require the original game to function.
It does NOT contain or require a keygen or crack of any sort, for online or offline play
It is a straight rip to ISO, should be instantly mountable by anything that can mount a .nrg file (e.g., Daemon Tools.)
If you have a Guardian's License for the original PSU, this will work with that same license, just enter your ID as normal.

Enjoy playing, all!"
,Scythe01,2007-11-22T01:23Z,some of us cant connect to the seed so we're pretty much feeding off the ones that are connected. any way to fix this or are we screwed?
,RickyC011,2007-11-22T01:27Z,"well as long as someone is connected to the seed, then the other will connect from the person connecting from the seed and so on ._.

I think it be very slow if every single person connected to the one seed now.

Though im not totally on how torrents work and im not connecting to the seed either so just guess this :O"
,mystiemus,2007-11-22T01:36Z,"Yeah, I'm basically connecting to a bunch of people trying to download and handing them parts that I haven't sent out yet, and those people in turn trade around those parts to everyone else.  So I send, say, part 10 to you, then you send part 10 to a few more people so I can get the entire file floating around, etc.

So rather than having to send the entire file 94 times (current number of peers), I only send it maybe two or three times, and everyone else shares around what they have to the point that everyone has the full file.

Not exact, but it's a quick approximation of how a torrent works, and why it's always important to seed after you finish downloading ^^"
,mystiemus,2007-11-25T22:03Z,"By the way, I do fully support purchasing the game when it becomes available in your area.  I think Sonic Team is doing a great job, and wanted to make this available for people whose release is delayed (eg., Europeans).

People probably aren't watching this anymore, but whatever, just wanted to say it anyway."
,Longheart,2008-03-21T20:07Z,Please Seed! Im halfway through the download! more seeding! 
,jpschulz,2008-05-06T04:32Z,its not letting me connect to the only peer. plz help im new to this.
,ShadowHeartless145,2012-06-16T11:51Z,Is there any seeders available for this?
