The Lezbians (Hector, Javi and Jose) got togheter in September 2006 with the aims of: Write some songs, play some gigs for friends, have a successful single off their first record, became rich and famous, destroy hotel room's furniture, realease a totally unsuccessful darker and more personal second album, split up, start unsuccesful solo careers and, finally, die old, alone and drunk.



Now, after some Gigs at Fotomat√õnBar and Sala El Sol, the band just recorded and selfreleased their first CD: Everything That Happens in September EP and will be promoting it live during the first months of the new year.
