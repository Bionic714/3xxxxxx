Thanks for the comment!
As for FLAC, it is simply another type of compression, just like MP3. However, unlike MP3, FLAC doesn't discard/delete any data from the original CD/WAV sound. So rather than throwing away lots of data to get the filesize down (like MP3), it works more like WinRAR, it just compresses the data so that it takes less room, but all the data iss till there, so when you play the FLAC file with Winamp or whatever program that supports it, the audio application basically decompresses the audio in real time as it plays the file. So while the FLAC file might be 50% as big as the original WAV file, when you play it, you have the exact copy of the original coming out of your speakers.

FLAC is somewhat new and some players don't support it. WInamp has native support for it I believe, and as for other programs like Windows Media Player and such, you will have to google or test yourself. But I imagine most audo playing applications have some way of being able to support FLAC playback, through plugins or codec updates or such. A google search for ""FLAC support *player name*"" or similar would probably give you good information and even step by step instructions to make it work if it doesn't already.


For more info, check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC.

And, since having a FLAC file basically means that you have the original WAV file from the CD, you can still convert the FLAC file to MP3 or any other format you want to using an audio compression software, and the result would be like you had compressed the original CD to MP3.



Hope the info helps some, if there are any other questions, don't hesitate to ask. :)"

I use Cubase SX as an environment for processing and fiddling with audio.
Basically, the host application isn't the important part. Any program that can host VST and other effects would work just fine, the difference lies more in the interface and what you might personally find works quicker or smoother.

The key is to find great effects and know/learn how to sue them and what they do. Also it takes some time just to sort of get your head around how to listen to audio in a more objective and ""technical"" way.

But for starters, find a sequencer program that can handle VST effects, and start with some of the built-in effects they usually come with for equalizing, compression and such. After that you just need to work on it alot.

I've been mixing and making my own tracks for a long time, so I've had lots of practice with equalizing and how I want things to sound to be pleasing for me.

Hope it helps. :)"
,julenissen123,2008-10-22T21:33Z,Thanks a lot for the reply. I understand much more now. Thank you so much.
,julenissen123,2008-10-22T22:03Z,"By the way, what programme do you use. Thought I might try it, seems fun to mix and try new things with audio. thanks"
,julenissen123,2008-10-23T00:14Z,"Thanks a lot for all the help. Believe me, it's much appriciated. Can't wait to download the Cubase SX 3. Loved what you've done with the files. They truly are optimized. Thanks again."
,julenissen123,2008-10-24T15:20Z,"You seem to know everything, so I have to ask you one more question: Some FLAC torrents include .log files. Why should I read these, and what should look for in the text."
,Tech-Noir,2008-10-25T10:54Z,"The log files are usually just statistical output from the software used to rip the CD into WAV/FLAC. It basically describes that the ripping process was completed without problems, and that the files are bit-for-bit identical with the original CD audio (if that indeed is the case).

Since FLAC is useful for storing CD collections, some people like to take solace in the fact that their ripped copies are as perfect as can be. :)"

Even with only a few seeds it downloaded very fast. The quality is very good. Some people don't like  FLAC, but I think it's a great option for quality and size considerations. Plays great on Winamp.

btw I'd forgotten how great this album is! It was released when I was in my 20's and I have such great, great memories of this time, and of these tracks, especially 'To Wish Impossible Things'. Thanks for making it available! "
