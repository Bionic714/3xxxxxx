,djzam,2007-11-23T13:20Z,Can We get a few more seeds ???
,Nobska,2007-11-23T13:37Z,"At this point (12:32 GMT - Friday 23/11/07) I am the only Seed (Uploader). However there are currently connected to 95 downloaders (out of 638). 45 of those are now are 97% or over. So in the next couple of hours you should see a big increases in seeds available (hoping that not too many hit&run).

Your patience will be rewarded with a fantastic collection of 25 years of the best of UK music, when placed on DVD, probably the best MP3 collection in the world (IMHO).

Thanks - Nobska"

,gibsta8570,2008-01-10T00:58Z,"Just a note to those who may be worried about the corrupt file reports.   -> If you listen to these mp3 files using the only program you should be using (iTunes) then every single song will play without a problem. Also, all the tags are displayed properly in the correct fields. This really is a meticulously made torrent. I've bought Nobksa a virtual drink already, I'd make sure he was too pissed to walk home if I had the chance in real life. "

,doomwatcher,2008-01-28T14:29Z,"Thanks very much for this upload. The enormous work that must have been put in is very appreciated.

Unfortunately, some of the recordings on this torrent are not the original recordings, but cheaper sounding re-records. A tiny fraction, so nobody be put off. But fere's the ones I've spotted so far which others may want to replace with the originals

1955	128 kbps	18. Bill Haley & His Comets - Rock Around The Clock
1961	128 kbps	06. Marcels - Blue Moon
1961	128 kbps	19. Helen Shapiro - Walkin Back To Happiness
1961	128 kbps	22. Danny Williams - Moon River
1963	128 kbps	08. Gerry & The Pacemakers - How Do You Do It
1963	128 kbps	14. Billy J. Kramer & The Dakotas - Bad To Me
1967	128 kbps	12. Foundations - Baby Now That I've Found You
1968	128 kbps	02. Love Affair - Everlasting Love
1968	128 kbps	05. Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich - The Legend Of Xanadu

And one from later on
1977	128 kbps	07. Rod Stewart - I Don't Want To Talk About It

Also 
1954	128 kbps	13. Rosemary Clooney - This Ole House

Is a faulty mp3

And perhaps others might want to add God Save The Queen by The Sex Pistols as another track 7 from 1977. It did sell the most records that week, and was number one in all but name, even though it was officially obstructed"
,doomwatcher,2008-01-30T01:51Z,"Two more cheapy re-records

1968	128 kbps	11. Equals - Baby Come Back
1970	128 kbps	01. Edison Lighthouse - Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)"

And then search the listing for :
1988	128 kbps	05. Pet Shop Boys - Heart

One thing though, following a very brief scan through, I don't know why the following are included, as they were never UK NO1s:

1955 Al Hibbler - Unchained Melody
1968 Louis Armstrong - Cabaret

Odd, is it Wikipedia or is it just the torrent?"
,rishidevdas,2008-04-13T06:46Z,"All the songs dont belong to the NO 1 list as mentioned......

,QBMan,2008-04-13T17:54Z,"I think there were no offical charts in the UK until 1954, therefore those previous to that year would be from the USA charts, hence the inclusion of some not deemed as UK No.1's. This is a fantastic history of popular music and should be viewed as such. Well done Nobska"
,F1R3F7Y,2008-04-14T00:40Z,thank you for your cataloging skills and for your efforts.
,Nobska,2008-04-15T00:42Z,"@crunchyfrog555

If you were to check Wikipedia or any other reputable internet resource (or book) you should find that :
1955 Al Hibbler - Unchained Melody
Did get to Number one in June 1955 in the 'Record Mirror' Chart in the uk a new chart launched earlier that year to rival the NME.

and....

1968 Louis Armstrong - Cabaret
Was the 'Double A' side of wonderful world - sometimes the 'record' was descibed as being at Number one with a double A side - so both tracks included in the collection.

,raptelan,2008-07-19T02:14Z,"This is an awesome collection, but a lot of the songs are terrible in quality.  By that I don't mean just a low bitrate, as I'm usually fine with 128k, but many of these are bad and skip and scratch and have weird sound artifacts.

Try just Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" (1998) for a great example of what I mean.  I don't know if the collector encoded many of these himself with some buggy program or what, but it's not just this song - it's a lot of them.

Ironically, many of the older songs are the best quality."
,Pojkvasker,2008-07-21T16:03Z,"Poor quality on some, If you really want em' that bad just download them from another place. Thank you for this upload! It was a great idea :)"

( . . . . )

I agree :
""This is a very good compilation of no 1s since 1952 and I congratulate this person on taking so much time and effort to do this torrent""

I haven't had time to explore the audio quality yet ( as som people state there's some questions on that ).

One thing I'm 100% certain though: the track
""Everlasting Love"" - 1968 \ 02 - is NOT the original. It's either a cover or a re-recording.
And, sadly, it's not even close to the old hit of -68. A shame really.

Big thanks anyway !"
