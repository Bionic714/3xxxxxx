Here is another episode from the 3rd season of Seconds from Disaster.
I recorded it with my receiver (Dishnetwork) to the computer (via TV tuner card) so the video quality is good, then I converted the video to avi format (because the mpeg version was almost 3GB big. 

Unfortunately, the ads are here too, because it was a hassle for me to stop and restart the recording when the ads played during the show. But you can skip/forward the ads when you play the video with a video player.

I will try to upload many other (and new) episodes of Seconds of Disaster.
I just have to find out when the show is actually playing.
