,Dani25,2007-11-22T02:31Z,"@roachab

Nope, I'll get it when it will be playing on NGC, don't worry..I'll try to get/record all episodes from all 3 seasons..I miss lot of them too..because most of the torrent sites have the same one too...its hard to find new ones :("
,Dani25,2007-12-01T05:50Z,"The next episode I am gonna record and upload here is the ""American Embassy Bombing"" one. It's a new episode, I never saw it. It's gonna be aired on Tuesday, December 18th from 12PM to 1PM, so be patient...As you can see, the show is only aired twice/month (tuesday and wednesday) and most episodes that are playing now, you have them already, they are not new.
But ill get most of the new ones, for sure"
