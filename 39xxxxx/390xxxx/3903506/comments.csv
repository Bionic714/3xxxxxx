Cute but very little traditional barbershop."
,Sote9108,2010-01-07T20:03Z,"Thanks for the info ameboaboy. While Rockapella rules, I am in a desperate online search of new Barbershop. I've been listening to Bluegrass Student Union and the Ultimate Collection of The Boston Common for years now. Ready to branch out!
Thanks for the upload Jasonsoccer08"
