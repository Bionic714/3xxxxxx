I had one person leaching, without sharing what he had downloaded with other people.

So I did a kick/ban, and he will have to wait for others to get the pieces he needs to finish his torrent.

I like people to seed, but when people don't share upload bandwidth when they are downloading, that is just sleazy.

What makes torrents work is people sharing their bandwidth.  Without that, torrents just don't work."
