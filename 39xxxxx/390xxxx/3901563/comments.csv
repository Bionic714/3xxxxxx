,(((louds,2008-03-15T09:35Z,How is 128 kbps pure quality?
,ellmarto,2008-03-19T19:39Z,"pretty bad description.
how about a tracklist instead?"
,ellmarto,2008-03-20T13:44Z,"tracks are good quality.

but no album cover included though. "
,ace_of_knaves,2008-09-07T11:05Z,"brilliant album, nice upload please seed"
[T],smithologikal,2008-09-19T01:44Z,"128Kbs is good quality...pure only means no flaws...anything higher truly wastes HD space not that its a problem these days but also not too noticeable to my ears....maybe you have exceptional hearing though =/....will seed...also track lists and album covers can be googled anywhere....try it you may be impressed..besides, its FREE!!! you can always buy from bestbuy, but why?? PEACE!!"
