unpack VistaActivator.exe.  You will get VistaActivationCrackSetup.exe.  This file is infected with a trojan."

,iamsuperbleeder,2007-12-24T05:14Z,"Well I'll be damned if it didn't work! Easy install, and now instead of saying ""3 Days Left Untill Outomatic Activation"", it says ""Windows is Actived"" and has the little Genuine Microsoft Software image there! No virus and it's works! What more could you ask for? Thanks a bunch gavej1010!"
