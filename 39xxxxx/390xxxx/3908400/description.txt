Vista Activator is a program that after installing a not not quite genuine Vista activates it so it does not expire after 30 days. 

1) Run the vistaactivator.exe
2) let it install
3) it will come up with the command promt after the first install
4) Again let it do its thing, 
5) When it tells you to restart, do so, its that easy.
6) And to check it has worked right click My Computer go to properties and scroll down, if it has worked it will say something like 'windows is activated'

And thats it, your done!

Let me know what you think and please seed if possible, i will seed for a few days.

Good Luck
