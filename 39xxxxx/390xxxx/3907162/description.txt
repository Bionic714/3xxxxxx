Summoning is an epic/atmospheric black metal band from Vienna, Austria. Their style has been described as Tolkien black metal - not without reason, for the lyrics on most of the albums they have published yet deal with the mythological world of J. R. R. Tolkien. The notable exception being Stronghold, which takes its lyrical content from many of Tolkien's poems rather than directly from his novels.

After a long silence, Summoning exploded with new album Stronghold in May 1999, forcing everybody to open their eyes and clean their ears. Album was recorded in Nachtschatten studio which is the home-studio of Protector, and was engineered and mixed by members of band themselves.
