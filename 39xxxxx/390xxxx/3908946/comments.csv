He's also the brother of actor Jon Voight, thus the uncle of Angelina Jolie. Two early Warner Bros records ""Chip Taylor's Last Chance"" and another produced material for oher artists, but finding a live version of THE REAL THING is a gem.
America doesn't appreciate some of (our) artists like europe does... and thank god Europe does!

Thanks for this sweet collection, bud!!!"
