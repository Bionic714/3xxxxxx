,melpo,2011-10-31T21:58Z,"But the whole serie (nine episodes this far) this weekend at a comic exebition in MalmÃ¶. Great to find a digital version as well. I'm guessing from the upload nick that it is the author who is initial uploader? Thanks very much, and keep seeding! 

Could we please get the other issues as digital versions to? Private scans are hard to get right. 

Note to others, on the first page of the book it states: "" So after you read this book, if you like it, tell your friends to buy it. Or, if they can't afford it, direct them to a free version of it on the internet. Or, if you canÃ¤t find one, can the pages and spread it ypurself. Piracy is, after all, liberation."""
