PIRACY IS LIBERATION 001: Information Wants to be Free (2nd ed, 2007)
by Mattias Elftorp

Info from http://www.elftorp.com/freeinformation and http://www.cestbonkultur.com/:

Pirate is an information addict. When he recieves a cry for help: 'Information wants to be free', he has to find out what it means. Only problem is that the infopolice are hot on his trail, so he has to run and avoid falling in the same trap that Information did. 

"an art style that seems to me to combine Brian Wood 
with Ben Templesmith, to jagged, hate-ridden, nervous effect. 
I really like it, and IÃ¢??m pissed off that my copy got mislaid."
