Certain aspects of this film border on a semblance of ""Monty Python meets the Queen's Afternoon Tea""."

,DogNo7,2010-10-03T11:11Z,"After all this time, this film still kills me.

Funniest damn thing I ever saw, well, maybe not quite Slaughterhouse Five, but still very amusing.

My favorite scene in Slaughterhouse Five is when the wife goes recklessly driving in the car that the main character bought her as a present.

Oh god.  I know the pain he feels.
