Story by Kurt Vonnegut.  This has a low rating from IMDB, but that is because most people are pathologically stupid.  It is a decent movie, strange of course, as anything from Kurt Vonnegut is guaranteed to be.

In any case, from the IMDB:

A portrait of a fictional town in the mid west that is home to a group of idiosyncratic and slightly neurotic characters. Dwayne Hoover is a wealthy car dealer-ship owner that's on the brink of suicide and is losing touch with reality.  Written by {jkeating@fast.net}

Based on the classic Kurt Vonnegut novel, Breakfast of Champions chronicles the meeting between Dwayne Hoover (Bruce Willis), an unstable Pontiac dealer, and Kilgore Trout (Albert Finney), an "overly creative" science fiction writer. The film also features Nick Nolte as Harry LeSabre, Hoover's cross-dressing associate, and Barbara Hershey. Written by Malachi 

--------------------------

Bruce Willis' character is just too damned funny in this movie.  The video quality is ok, and audio is reasonably good (levels are good, sound is clear).

In any case, enjoy.
