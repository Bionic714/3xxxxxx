If you have seen Adam Curtis' other documentary - the Power of Nightmares - then you will find this equally as insightful and thought-provoking.

This documentary explores the hidden influence of big business over what we fondly believe to be our freedom and democracy.  If such things matter to you, at least download the first of the four files contained in this torrent; you will not regret it.

The quality of the sound and video is OK; watchable but not wonderful"

,japannn,2009-07-18T16:57Z,I have a question if anyone can help me? Once I have downloaded this how can I make it go onto two discs? I want to put two episodes on each disc. Thanks
,jacktreez,2009-11-27T20:01Z,"jappann since the files are avi which means audio video interlaced you have to use a DVD burning software and add the avi files to the dvd project you are trying to burn. Roxio, sonic, and toast are some of the softwares used. Just follow the softwares instructions you have to create your own menu though."

,bazquux,2011-08-29T23:22Z,"Curtis has a lot to answer:
""Ask him why he has failed to respond to the articles and letters that have been sent to him. Ask him why The Century of the Self gave so much detailed attention to Guatemalan history, and yet failed to mention U.S. responsibility for the 150,000 civilians killed as a result of its assault on Guatemala. Ask why the series focused on this isolated U.S. intervention without mentioning that it was a small part of similar interventions elsewhere in Latin America and in the Third World generally. Is this wider pattern not central to understanding the real significance, and costs, of corporate control of domestic and foreign societies in the 20th and 21st centuries?""
