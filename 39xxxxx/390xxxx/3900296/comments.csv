,lloyd5867,2008-09-13T02:52Z,"hi everyone,


i suggest using Astroburn for burning into .iso, never had an error with it, and have been using this download for about a year now. never had a problem with it.


http://disc-tools.com/download/astroburn



and the not being able to access the internet is as simple as this. 

this copy of windows is a ""mass install"" copy, in other words. its made specifically for installing on multiple hundreds (even thousands) of computers and have NOTHING on them but the essentials. both for saving space AND limiting what is on the computer at install. 


it comes with everything basic, no adds or anything, it has the Microsoft games, such as solitaire. 


**WARNING**

you will need to find what ever drivers are on your computer. in other words, back to the no internet access, you will need to find the driver for your ethernet port, tho i have only noticed this problem if its a nVidia Nforce board, though i wouldnt risk it. find your mother board disk, or go to you device manager and look what its called and look for it on the internet. 



any questions email me,

xx.socially.outcast.xx@gmail.com

--lloyd"
,Insel_Affe,2008-09-16T10:38Z,"Just to address the issue with the drivers if you download and install this program >>>>>

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4300455/Driver_Genius_Pro_2008_v8.0.316_Keygen-HeartBug

It will find all the drivers that your computer needs Soundcard, Ethernet etc, that way it doesn't matter even if you've binned all your original cds that came with the computer, alternatively use the software before you reinstall to create a self extracting archive that will  reinstall all your previous drivers back on your new OS."

[T],GWpirateGW,2009-07-13T17:03Z,"Step By Step on how to Install(i lost my iso so I am dling this)

1. Locate ALL of your drivers 1st(check your pcs makers website.

Dell
http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/index.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=dhs&cs=19

HP
http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/support.html

Sony
http://esupport.sony.com/perl/select-system.pl
etc  Just google Name of PC + Driver download...The search the website.

Step 2.
You need a ISO Burning Software
http://www.ntfs.com/iso-burning.htm
I use Active ISO(link above)  100% free.

Step 3. Burn at 1x speed.  If you burn faster, it will lose important Data files.  Burning at 1x speed takes 5 minutes.

Step 4. Pop it back in.  If you see the Windows XP Screen pop up saying install now(DO NOT).

Step 5. Restart your PC and boot from CD drive.

I only tested XP on Cd, but I am sure it can work off a dvd too, as my Custom made Xp is 888MB and needs a dvd to run it.

Hope this was helpful to some of you.

,netodude,2010-05-20T02:11Z,"if you're missing bootmgr, try burining the iso on a different comp. its most likely because your os cant burn newer udf formats. so go burn it on either vista or 7

one way to check if you can burn udf is to try and burn the cd and open the burned cd in windows explorer. if you can see all the files, then this doesnt apply to you.
the same problem happened to me when i was burning win7 onto a cd.

if you cant install it right from your desktop, try a clean install, which will delete everything. so backup, boot from the burned iso and clean install."

,jaaystott,2011-02-09T16:58Z,"Thanks Blackhand101, this should work nicely on my Vista based Computer.

@linuxowner - Stop trying to put people off a perfectly fine torrent? This is brilliant for people that wan't to modify XP, as SP3 doesn't allow them too, and its just as good to run as an operating system. The key is clearly shown in the description, so stop bullshitting and get on.

Everyone else, this torrent is 100% perfecto. Download and Enjoy! "

,Akdude666,2011-10-15T10:34Z,"One thing i must say. Torrent is good im very pleased to it, but if you use 64-system heres solution:

https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads 
get virtual box, install the Xp pro here (dont worry it wont format your current system's C: drive)
then run the setup go trough this manual -->
https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html
You dont need to read all the text just the basic stuff
i cant answer all Q's but the youl need for the whole thing about 4GB ram would be perfect for playing anything.
what it does it will make subsystem to your vista/7 that are 64 system and you wanna play the game from 90's or a program you remember but cant run it in 64 based system."
