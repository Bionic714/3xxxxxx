,bunglem,2007-11-26T16:35Z,"I have a question, I'm using a mac and when I extract this file using severall different extraction programs I end up with a three second clip of a green screen. The file extracts to 700mb and with out any errors. 

Any suggestions?"
,aholden,2007-11-27T02:46Z,@bunglem: try playing it with VLC (videolan.org). It's probably just a question of codec support. It plays fine on my Mac :)
