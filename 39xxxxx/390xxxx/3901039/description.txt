notes : i wanted to watch this on my big tv, my divx/xvid player spat its dummy out and would not play after 3 seconds (might just be my copy but hey!), could not be arsed to move big screen to pc room and wanting decent speakers to listen to, so i just re-encoded it...this is for anyone that had the same problem..if any....
