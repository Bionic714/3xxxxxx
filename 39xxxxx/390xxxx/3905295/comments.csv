,ricko16,2007-11-23T14:39Z,The PLane Works great but the screens  still go out after a few minutes please fix that for us Derice
,ricko16,2007-11-23T14:47Z,"No wait the screens only work on the ground not in air

I think you can fix that Derice thanks "
,Derice,2007-11-23T14:49Z,"I'm sorry, but I've only spotted this on usenet and turned it into a torrent.
I don't know enough about this sort of stuff to be able to fix that bug. 

Maybe someone else can?"
,ricko16,2007-11-23T15:07Z,"What do you mean with this Derice 


and in the registry under HKLM/SOFTWAREAbraxisTheftTrackingMBXhtvx1"
,Derice,2007-11-23T16:11Z,"Like I said before, I've found this on usenet, I didn't crack it myself.

But to answer your question, it's a registry path.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE-SOFTWARE-Abraxis-TheftTracking-MBX-htvx1

With a value:

c2e80520102f0800e790160704de90760a1b3801

this value corresponds with the SHA1 in the aircraft.cfg file(s)."

,jayrodathome,2007-11-23T20:57Z,Make sure you have the latest nvidia drivers. they came out with new drivers for the 8800 last month..Second if you have xp make sure that you do not have the DX10 preview checked. if you have vista just make sure you have the updated drivers. Good Luck. 
,spoutnik0,2007-11-23T21:45Z,"It works perfectly. The Primary Flight Display does not shut down after 1 min. It is mandatory to add abraxis regs key or it will not work !

,MBroony,2007-11-24T02:53Z,hey can someone help. when i load it in fsx it closes fsx? whats wrong
,nilisvd,2007-11-24T11:13Z,"Hmmm, both the crack in the torrent as the validation bypasser are not working in my case. I cannot click the next button on the validation tab in the installation dialog.

,Derice,2007-11-24T13:16Z,"I've finally been able to test it myself and it works for 100%
(Vista x64, 4GB, FSX + SP1).

Please note that when running a x64 OS you have to modify the registry keys provided!

Original key:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE-SOFTWARE-Abraxis]

X64 key:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE-SOFTWARE-WOW6432Node-Abraxis]

At first I didn't do this on my machine, resulting in the screens shutting down after 1 minute, once I changed the key it worked!

This also works with the updated version posted http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3872453/PMDG747_400_FSX_UPDATE.zip

You don't need the crack FUCKWOS posted.
My anti virus (Trend Micro Officescan) reports a virus in that one (no offence).

,Derice,2007-11-25T22:24Z,"Just to confirm for everyone:

I've done a return FMC/IFR flight from Amsterdam to London and everything works perfectly!
No issues what so ever.

@zeophex have you tried it with a clean install of FSX? That's how I tested it, works like a charm."
,zeophex,2007-11-26T01:00Z,"no dice. tried to use it after a re-install of FSX and SP1. Then i tried uninstalling the PMDG and reinstalling it and still didnt work. My reg key looks like this

is this right? is there anything else that im doing wrong? plz help me. All help is greatly appreciated THANKS IN ADVANCE!"
,DeakStarwalker,2007-11-26T01:03Z,They need to find the fsx registry install location?
,chalk06,2007-11-26T05:29Z,"The only thing that I can think of, is it still sounds like you may have pieces of PMDG left over after your uninstall. I removed my old PMDG FSX attempts by using add/remove pro (uninstall and remove entry commands.)

 The only other thing that I did different than the readme calls out, is that I added the ---begin sha--- values before I ran the reg files, both in the the reg and the aircraft.cfg files. My feeling is that these issues seem to be in the registry. Once I had purged it from all PMDG references, it worked a treat. One thing I noticed right away, is that I got thumbnails for the planes as opposed to question marks so that could be an indicator for you without having to load a flight to save time."
,chalk06,2007-11-26T05:33Z,"Oh and to add one thing, thanks to you Derice, I also just finished a FMC flight and it was just awesome!! "

,zeophex,2007-11-26T22:38Z,WOW took some time to do the research and found that having the Core2 duo means i have to have a x32 OS. (how did i not know that considering that i built my PC??) Anyways GREAT UPLOAD flies like a charm THANKS DERICE for the upload and help!!!!
,Derice,2007-11-27T08:53Z,"@zeophex having a Core 2 Duo doesn't mean you have a x32 OS. I have a Core 2 Duo and am running x64 Vista. ;)

,[420],2007-12-02T06:17Z,"I was at my wits end trying to get this damn plane to work without the CRT displays turning off after 20 secs, then i found a comment by ""guybrush_threepwood"" on the FS9 torrent for the same plane.  

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3536203/PMDG_Boeing_747-400_Passenger_and_Boeing_747-400F_Cargo_with_ALL

Run the installer, when you get to the validation page, enter any email, any number combo [i used 20 digits, don't know if it matters], and any password.  Hit 'Validate' and an error will happen.  THEN use the 'enablebutton.exe' file, hit 'OK' for the error, and continue installing.  DONT use the registry keys that come with the file, just run the game.

This worked for me... The displays stay on.  I took off and cruised at 35000ft and left the game running for about 2hrs.  The displays were still on when i came back and everything seemed to be working OK.  I didn't bother trying to land, and I didn't try using the FMC, but as far as I can tell, all the aircraft systems are working properly.  If there is still some kind of protection in the works, then it hasn't come up yet.  Hopefully this helps someone as I have been looking for days on how to get this to work...

Thanks goes to ""guybrush_threepwood"" for his posting.  CHEERS."
,fan_thomas,2007-12-04T15:03Z,"All systems in the bird works good, but when i was flying with her a few minutes later, the filght simulator stepped out. While I'm flying other aircraft the FS works good.
Fresh FSX install, latest version of graphic card software, Nvidia GeForce 7950 GT graphic card.
Has anybody idea? 
"
,Pocus1981,2007-12-09T13:20Z,"guybrush's method works for the passenger version but not the Cargo version. 

The 747-400f installer just terminates when you enter in false details and hit the Validate button, so you can install it but your displays go after 1min 15seconds once you start the bird.

Has anyone found a way around this?? I have the 747-400 working nicely but not the 747-400f :("

I press okay and get to the validation. I open the enable program and when I click to validate, I get a message that validation was not able because of my firewall settings. When I disengage it, same problem. Anyone has a solution?

I needed the whole day but now it works.

A question: Can I download liveries from the PMDG-website? Because when you download a livery for the PMDG Md-11 the livery-installer will check if you payed for the Software. If not it will delete the MD-11 folders in Simobjects\Airplanes.

It is the same with the 747?
