,thafrogggg,2007-11-29T12:35Z,"Yes, it is great having these in all in one file, but this set, like all the others I have tried is missing some parts of the book.

A prime example of this is in book 2 in the section where Richard and Kalhan are returning to the mudpeople village.  Here is the text from the PDF

Richard was surprised, and seemed to be moved by what Savidlin had done. 'The Mud People make some of the finest fbows I have ever seen. I am honored, Savidlin. That is was poison, the result of an evil magic. They didn't know that in Westland, where Richard was from, you could eat red things like apples. They had seen him eat an apple once before, when he had tricked them into not making him take a wife from their village by convincing them that his eating it might make his seed poisonous to his bride, but they sweated as they watched the two of them doing it again.

""In between I am honored, Savidlin.""  and ""That is was poison"" about 2 or 3 pages from the actual hard copy book are missing.

This is the most noticeable example I can think of, but there are more in there.

I am not knocking Sovk-001's upload, or the hard work put into it.  I am just pointing out that there are some ""gaps"" in these scanned books.

I really wish that Tor or Goodkind would authorize them to be published in an ebook format.  Until then, I will keep looking for a complete scanned copy.

Yes, I Would do it myself, but I no longer have my hardcover copies.  I read on average one 700+ page book a month, and do not have room to keep all those books.  Many are donated to my local library."
,MagiciansFR,2007-11-29T16:08Z,"Darn, sorry to hear about the gaps, and yes no knock to you sovk. I only have 3 books myself currnetly and like you thafrogggg, I read several science fiction/fantasy books a month. I sell the books back to a helf-priced book store. When I scan a book, I scan the front and back cover and the maps and like to put them with the scanned book. I can't seem to do that in these PDF files even though I have the full Acrobat application. Anyone know how to extract the text out of the PDF into a Word file or something?"
,thafrogggg,2007-11-30T09:37Z,"MagiciansFR,

There are plenty of PDF converters out there, some of them are actually free.   Just google convert PFD to Microsoft word and you will get plenty of hits.

I also am able to open these PDF with my copy of Adobe reader (ver 7.09) and save them as a text file using the ""save as"" feature in the file menu. You could then open up the text file with MS word and edit it to your heart's content. "
,rickenwolf,2008-06-23T02:46Z,Thank you for your hard work!
,Alkampfer,2008-07-08T10:44Z,"thx,good collection"
,oPiN37,2008-08-11T01:07Z,"just wanted to say, that I was hooked for these books ever since I read the first page.. I searched for the books here on piratebey as a joke, but I was thrilled when I learned that someone had scanned the books, and put them out on the internet... but when I had read a couple of pages, I learned that the who who did the scanner, had been having some fun with this! there are several misspelling, but the book is still readable... 
7/10... maybe..."

Richard was surprised, and seemed to be moved by what Savidlin had done. ""The Mud People make some of the finest bows I have ever seen. I am honored, Savidlin. That is generous of you. I would like very much to have you there with me."" He grinned. ""We can show those two how to shoot.""

The brothers laughed at the last part of the translation. ""Tomorrow then,"" Prindin said as they left.

Richard had a dark look on his face as he watched the two walking away.

""What was that all about with the arows?"" she asked.

He finally looked over at her. ""Ask Savidlin if I could have a look at his arrows, and I'll show you.""

Savidlin handed over his quiver. Richard pulled out a handful of arrows, sorting through the ones with thin, hardened wooden points. Kahlan knew them to be poisoned. Richard took an arrow with a flat, metal point and put the rest back.

He handed the arrow to her. ""Tell me what you see.""

She rolled it in her fingers as he had done with the other. She didn't know what that was supposed to tell her, so she looked at the point and the nock.

She shrugged. ""It looks just like an ordinary arrow to me. Just like any other.""

Richard smiled. ""Just like any other?"" He plucked an arrow out of the quiver by the nock end, holding the small round point up for her to see. He raised an eyebroe. ""Does it look like this one?""

""Well, no. That point is small, long, thin, and round. But this one has a metal point. It's just like the one Prindin had.""

Richard slowly shook his head. ""No. It's not."" He put the wodden pointed arrow back and took the one she had, holding the nock toward her. ""See here? Where the string goes? It goes on the string like this, with the notch up and down. Does that tell you anything?"" She frowned and shook her head. ""Some arrows have spiraled feathers so the arrows rotate. Some people believe that increases their power. I don't know if that is true or not, but it's beside the point. All the Mud People's arrows are fletched with straight feathers. That keeps them steady in flight. They hit in the same attitude as they are fired.""

""But I still don't see how this arrow is diffeent from Prindin's.""

Richard put his thumbnail in the nock. ""This is the way the arrow goes on the string. With the notch up and down like this. When the arrow is in the bow, and when it hits, it is just like this. Now, look at the blade. See how it's up and down, too? Just like the notch. The blade and the string are in the same plane. Savidlin's bladed arrows are all like this.

""The reason for it is that he uss these bladed arrows to hunt large animals, like wild boar, and deer. The rib bones in animals go up and down, just like the blade does. That gives the arrow a better chance of passing between the rubs, rather than being stopped by them.""

He leaned a little closer to her. ""Prindin's arows are different. The blades are turned ninety degrees. When his arrows are knocked, the blade is horizontal. His arrows aren't made to pass through the ribs of animals. The blades are horizontal because he hunts something different. Something with ribs that are horizontal. People""

Kahlan felt bumps ripple up her arms. ""Why would they do that?""

""The Mud People are very protective of their land; they don't often allow outsiders in. I would guess that Chandalen and his men are the ones who guard their borders from encroachment. They are probably the fiercest hunters among the Mud People, and the best shots. Ask Savidlin if they are good with their bows.""

She conveyed his question.

Savidlin chuckled. ""None of us ever beats Chandalen's men. Even if Richard With The Temper is good, he is going to lose. But they are careful not to humiliate us too badly. They will be gracious winners. Richard should not worry, he will enjoy the day. They will teach him to shoot better. That is why I wish to take my men: Chandalen's men always teach us to be better. Among the Mud People, being the best, winning, means you have a responsibility to those you have beat"
,tman_694,2009-02-28T20:32Z,"Is there a lit version available, been looking but havn't seen one.  I don't use pdf's on my pocket pc as the interface is horible and the files are larger.

Thx in advance"
,zcott007,2009-04-29T06:55Z,"This is one of the worst series I have ever attempted to read. I got as far as the third book and could go no further. 
Goodkind's writing is extremely juvenile and he plagiarizes multiple ideas from other writers.
I highly recommend ""Wheel of Time"" by Robert Jordan and ""Song of Ice and Fire"" by George R.R. Martin"
,Karcusha,2009-09-23T06:47Z,Thanks a lot!
,drakosdarklata,2009-12-18T11:54Z,"Zcott007, while you have the right to your own opinion, I would like to point out a few things. First of all, noone is impressed with your vocabulary and it doesn't give any extra credence to your opinion. Second, all plagiarism would mean an outright theft of another's idea, not simply having similarities, if it was truly plagarism, he'd have been sued years ago. As he has not been sued and Tor has continued to publish his works tells me that he is on the up and up. Third, unless you are a successful author or an English Professor, noone really cares if you liked it, since you didn't all I can say is get on with your life, delete the pdfs from your HD and never look back. Oh, and who are you to talk complain, it isn't as though you bought the books, you downloaded them, for free, that's closer to plagiarism than anything in Mr. Goodkind's books. "
,mscollins,2010-01-20T05:30Z,"What the crap is this update your bit comet. I don't use bit comet, fuck you for telling me to update a program I haven't considered installing on my computer.


Sorry for being so harsh, found out last weekend my girlfriend was pregnant and she broke up with me tonight."
,sshaiy007,2010-03-23T04:14Z,Thank you so much for what you have done for us who want to read the series of The sword of Truth.. I cant believe that the are not all on ebooks. I have Wizard's Frist Rule on ebooks. When I realized I couldn't get the others I was beside my self. I dont know why but i just cant stand holding a book lol. So thank you again for all the time you put in to this. As far as you go zcott007 you have your right not to like a book are a autor but you have no right to say those kinds of things when you could see how many people love it he is a NY #1 best seller Autor. And may we all enjoy and lose ourself to his great writing
,Leldavis,2010-05-16T18:43Z,"Thanks for this U/L! I've been waiting for my copy of Debt of Bones for ages, but I need something to read at work or I'll go crazy. This is great. Thanks again."
,cybershadow01,2010-08-05T23:41Z,"Great to find all of these books in one place 
lots of seeders the download went really fast

Tech Geek info

If your using Utorrent and running symantec antivirus it can give you a false positive on one of the incomplete .!UT files. The PDF's themselves are all clean so apearantly it is angry at the way utorrent writes this perticular file. It is harmless but can interupt the download and force a recheck so you may want to exclude the folder in advance"
,cybershadow01,2010-08-05T23:50Z,"The Files are all Clean and aside from the missing pages mentioned earlier this is a great find however there is a little annoyance.

if you use Utorrent and Symantec antivirus together. Symantec bitches about one of the incomplete .!UT files with a false positive and although the finished PDF file is safe. it interrupted my download twice and forced a recheck. you can solve the problem by un-checking the rename incomplete files box or excluding the destination folder "
