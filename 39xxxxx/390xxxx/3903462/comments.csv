,DavidGGG,2007-12-29T01:14Z,"Thanks, very nice picture quality (some sound sync problems though, but I bet you'll not find a better rip)

BTW, this movie is actually public domain since the copyright was never renewed, so for once, a Pirate Bay download is perfectly legal!

,DogNo7,2008-01-03T09:12Z,"Sound sync problems might be related to the divx compressor that was used.  I will recheck this rip and pay special attention towards the sound.  I have a DVD copy, I believe, so I can re-rip if necessary with xvid and ac3 in an avi container."
,DogNo7,2008-01-04T01:15Z,"Now that I have gone back and watched it again, I see what you mean about the minor sound sync delta.  I haven't dug it out yet, but as I recall now that I watch it, the original DVD I have, has the same 1/8th-1/16th second differential.

For me, it did not hinder my ability to enjoy the movie.

As the movie was filmed by Bogart's production company in conjunction with an Italian studio, and given that the majority of the actors were Italian and of other ethnicities, it is little wonder that the movie had to be overdubbed.  It is a great movie though, one of my favorite Bogart films.  Thanks for the upload!"
