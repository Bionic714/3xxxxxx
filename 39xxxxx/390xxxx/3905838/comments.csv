Enjoy!

I am happy to share all my collection with you!

I very much appreciate all the efforts that you are deploying to keep the Fu alive by seeding these torrents, whenever possible and with the means that you have at your disposal, and I sincerely thank you all.

Together, let's keep the Fu alive, REGARDLESS OF THE CARYING BOAT!

If you happen to be an active seeder, please drop your hotmail email address so that other Fu Members could contact you for a possible reseed."

The spoken language on this VCD is Chinese (not English as mentioned earlier during the post) and there are English subtitles.

Cheers"
