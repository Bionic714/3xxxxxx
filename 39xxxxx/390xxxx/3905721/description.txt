This is Uncle Scrooge 174-273. It's part 17 of a many art 40gb or so Gold Key Comics torrent.

I usually did DC comics torrents on Demonoid, but I was in the midst of a big Gold Key Series (long story) when the demon went down. I put part XVI on zcult but since DC/Marvel stupidly threatened them they are temporarily tracker-less and it will be at least 2 weeks if ever before any comics torrents will appear there. 
This was an a-z everything I have of Gold Key in 1-2gb chunks project. Around 70 titles were involved, most very incomplete. Some titles include other issues in the same title that were published under other imprints or even other publishers. If the title was published some of the time by Gold Key thats good enough I try not to be over-literal about things like that.

Hopefully some of the fans of this will find it here

If you are new to this series it is of probably little use asking me to post the first 16 parts, as if I am going to keep uploading torrents at all (doubtful unless demonoid returns), I'd rather get back to my first love, DC. I wouldn't do this much except I hate leaving a thing unfinished or done poorly. Besides if I don't complete it the CRIA win!

2-3 parts to come.
