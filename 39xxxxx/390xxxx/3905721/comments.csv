I already have all the Uncle Scrooge issues, but I'm looking forward seeing you're DC stuff.

Keep it up!!!"

One of my favorite old comics were the Super Friends from 76' to about 1981.  You have an older torrent of them - but alas it is not fully seeded - 89.3% - so here is a respectful request - should you see this and still have the scans, the 7 year old trying to remember within me would owe you debts beyond payment.  Thnx Again!"
