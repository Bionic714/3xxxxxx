Details:
The whisper that has grown to the full frontal fusion of distorted heavy-metal guitar riffs, deep twisted bass notes and a genuine social disorder can only be surmised as Korn. With several million records sold world wide, Korn have completely reconstructed the metal sound into a hard-hitting, uncomromising catapult that many bands imitate, but will never duplicate. The Electro-Industrial Tribute to Korn severs the imitations and delivers a brand new interpretation of the music of Korn, intense tracks like "Wake up" and "It's on" capture the anger and resentment of Korn, while tracks like "Reclaim My Place" and "Falling Away From Me" display the bands melancholy and despair, not to mention the original Korn-inspired track "Gone" by Motor Industries. A definite must for Korn fans everywhere. The whisper has become a deafening roar-"Are You Ready?"
