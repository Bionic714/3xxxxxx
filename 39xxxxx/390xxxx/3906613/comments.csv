,Sobbsy,2008-01-09T15:45Z,"Fucking awesome. Seriously... One of the best Rifftraxs in a long time.

I really hope you (or anyone, for that matter) can get the rest of the LOTR series rifftrax'd eventually, because I'd love to watch the rest.

As always, if you like it, donate. 5 or 10 bucks is fuck all for the great viewing you get :D"

,whole_hurtedly,2008-03-19T04:52Z,I HATE THIS TORRENT. PLS REMOVE THE RIFFTRAX. A HUGE DISTURBANCE TO THE MOVIE. BUT NICE VIDEO QUALITY.
,rocketbaby,2008-06-07T09:49Z,"whole_hurtedly, this isn't the torrent you are looking for.

The rifftrax is the whole point.

I've donated some money this month, how about the rest of you leechers?"
,meegapop,2008-06-07T16:01Z,"thx, can  i gets some speed to maby:) "
,QuickXilver,2008-06-27T10:19Z,what the fuck is this shit? oooooooh man you suxxxxxxxx . can't believe i downloaded this crap.

,_kenpachi,2008-08-08T16:55Z,"Great upload! And to you idiots who can't read apparently, this is a rifftrak, it is making fun. Don't download it, it will make you're little brain hurt. As for everyone else, enjoy the goodness!

Donate, Donate, Donate!"
,gorgonzola9,2008-08-29T07:45Z,plzzz seed only downloading at 24kb/s :(
,agentaika,2008-10-23T19:44Z,"If Mike Nelson didn't make it so obvious that he was a conservative (the constant jabs at liberal politicians, comedians, etc), I probably would have made several donations by now. But I can't, in good conscious, give money to someone who supports Elizabeth Hasselbeck. Fuck that weak shit.

,agentaika,2008-10-24T19:46Z,"Welp, I've had a change of heart. Mike Nelson may have some character flaws, but he is still a nice guy, and he makes me laugh. I'm going to give RiffTrax a donation tomorrow."
,skyman299,2009-01-15T04:08Z,"As much as I hate to say it, I didn't enjoy this one as much as the others.  It's probably because they, like myself, actually liked the movie in its original form.  "
,terron123,2010-04-06T00:48Z,"Audio is messed up in some places

For example: 00:00:40 where she says ""I feel it in the earth"""
,asrayo,2010-07-31T14:53Z,"I can't get the rifftrax, this plays just the regular movie.  I am using VLC.  Is there something special I need to do to hear the commentary?  there is only one audio track.  Any help is appreciated."
,pyromaster287,2011-01-28T09:50Z,Is anyone else hearing the voices!?!?!?!? O.o
