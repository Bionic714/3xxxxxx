Hello out there

Here´s an upload that maybe is interesting :o)

It consists of the following

Slysoft 20071120 (their final programs as of this date)

AnyDVD_6.2.0.1
CloneCD_5.3.1.0
CloneDVD mobile_1.1.6.0
CloneDVD_2.9.1.2
GameJackal Pro_2.9.18.600
Virtual CloneDrive_5.2.0.2

Working patches/keys are of course included (have tested them) :o)
They are as follows
AnyDvd: Crack that replaces 2 original files in program folder, gives
        full HD-support :o)
CloneCd: Reg key
CloneDVD mobile: Reg key
CloneDVD: Keygen
GameJackal Pro: Soft patcher
Virtual CloneDrive: Dont need a patch since it´s freeware

This package also include

DVDFab Platinum 4.0.1.2 (This program comes with tried, tested and working
                         serial number)

Important notes!!!
All of the above programs are completely untouched originals and not messed around with.
As of always when using patches, keys etc dont forget:
Install OFFLINE without being connected to the net, install, patch and turn OFF
every programs autoupdate feature before going online again...

More important:
Slysoft says the latest Virtual CloneDrive 5.2.0.2 is fully compatible
with 32-bits Windows Vista. I say it´s not :-(
Works fine as long as you only use it for mounting and playing
DVD-images, but NOT work that well when mounting an image and copying it.
Still seems to be some issues there....
So if you need to do that use Daemon tools instead....
DVDFab Platinum is a simple to use program what works very well
in the most cases, BUT, when it comes to heavily protected discs
it´s not as good as AnyDVD (Finded it out by own testing)


Hope you enjoy this little toolbox folks :o)
