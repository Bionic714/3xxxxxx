Doing it this way not only allows people to chose or not chose to download what they want, but it also, as you mentioned allows them to see whats in it. Now of course comes the sucky part. you have to seed until at least a few people have this all 100%. for 4 gigs thats alot of dedication if you have a semi low speed line, but congrats on doing it."
[V],rambam1776,2008-01-16T06:49Z,"I plan to seed this thing for a very long time, or until there are many other seeds. Sadly, my DSL only allows a max upload of about 80 kbps. Plus, now I can point my buddies to this instead of having to burn discs. I must have burned this collection 200 times by now."
,Sockerkristallen,2008-01-21T18:06Z,"Thanks for this!
I'm downloading it for my dad... he will love it =)
But I think I will keep a copy for myself to.
Great work!!!
Huge appreciations!"
[V],rambam1776,2008-01-22T03:22Z,"You're very welcome. I'll admit I was hoping for a few more comments - this collection took a long time. Anyway, now that it is finally being seeded, please keep it up for awhile. It took a week to upload it."
,Alakazim,2008-01-29T09:49Z,Thank you very much for this. It must be the most complete irish collection I've seen so far.
,SilverSyntho,2008-01-30T05:19Z,"Downloading it now.  My god, man, this is the most epic collection I've run across.  Kudos."
,LaugZ,2008-01-30T15:38Z,"OMG, this must be the best selection of irish drinking songs ever, BIG thanks too you rambam1776 ;) 

From norwegian fan ^^"
,cyks,2008-02-07T02:09Z,"Many, many thanks!  Great collection.

Not that I mind, but curious on the omission of U2."
[V],rambam1776,2008-02-10T00:43Z,"cyks - 

Sorry bout that, but U2 is in its own folder under ROCK back on my system. I've thought of uploading that stuff, but my regular music collection isn't ""torrent-normal"", it's just songs I happen to like. That means I don't have complete albums, and most stuff is at 96-128 kbps. I don't beleive in wasting limited storage space on songs I dislike reorded at quality beyond the capacity of the human ear. If I uploaded it, people would gripe. Screw 'em, maybe I will anyway."
,Volkolak,2008-02-16T22:08Z,"Thanks you man!
Hello from Russia! :-)"
,sctroderick,2008-02-22T20:26Z,Hope to play for my St. Patrick's day party! Props ram! Going to take a couple of days tho :|
,sctroderick,2008-02-23T02:52Z,"Also! I forget which band you have, but out of the two

Celtic Connection
and Irish Dependants

The one you do not have, i highly recommend, check them out. "
[V],rambam1776,2008-02-23T03:34Z,"Well, I also have about another 600 songs on tape, but I don't have the means to make quality mp3's of them. St Pat's is huge around here, so make sure you try Juice o the barley, a good local band. For YOUR party, I recommend the Dubliners and The Irish Rovers as the most generically represenative. A few days ago I released a new Dubliners Torrent, you might want to search my name for that one. Try the comedy stuff, too"
,MrTeacherSr,2008-02-25T18:24Z,Thank you - thank you - thank you!!!!!
,Lilozzie,2008-02-27T09:56Z,I finished this download about 3 weeks ago and never mentioned my appreciation. Liked it so much that I've been seeding it ever since and will continue to until it is completely dead. Thanks and keep up the good work.
,stofkat,2008-03-16T16:00Z,Thanks a lot man! This collection is great. Just what I've been looking for.
[V],rambam1776,2008-03-17T21:40Z,Happy St. Pat's to everyone!
,booger114,2008-04-04T21:50Z,"thanks, this sounds great"
,nrg-ch,2008-04-30T22:54Z,"Thanks a LOT!
Greets from Russia, again :)"
,Rehab_Doll,2008-06-02T13:04Z,"Attempted to download torrent, but the file is corrupt. :("
,Rehab_Doll,2008-06-02T13:05Z,Correction: It says it's not a valid torrent file.  Help?
[V],rambam1776,2008-06-06T14:11Z,"I just downloaded the torrent, and it started right up - seems to work just fine. Try downloading the same one from mininova if this one doesn't work, I guess."
,divx-rider,2008-07-04T20:21Z,Thanks for this great collection.
[V],rambam1776,2008-07-11T15:30Z,"Version 2 of the collection is now available, with an additional 6 gig of music. Just click my name."
,delightindisorder,2008-09-12T01:29Z,Would it be inappropriate to call you rambam1776 of the dance?  Thanks.
,SirJohn88,2008-11-08T17:47Z,Nice but where is Paddy McGuinty's Goat?
,shanyo,2009-03-15T21:00Z,i love you
[V],rambam1776,2009-03-17T21:53Z,"Once again, Happy St. Pats to everybody!"
,dessertrat,2009-05-02T23:28Z,"Your Simply the Best :-))
Great music thanks a lot."
,booarcade,2009-07-01T22:15Z,Strange no one bothered to mention that most of the songs are encoded at 64-96kbit. 
[V],rambam1776,2009-07-12T10:40Z,"That's because that was the bit rate available on most of the albums when i found them back in the old Napster days. However, let's not pretend that 96 is 30. They sound fine. I get bloody sick and tired of LIARS who pretend that they and Batman are capable of hearing the pitch differentials at 320 kbps. Even if you had superhero hearing, you'd need the sound system from G-d to be able to play something at that quality. I doubt if your ear buds on the iPod are capable of reaching that quality level."
,ClTIZEN,2009-09-07T01:10Z,nice one. some tracks not great quality but most are good. I will seed for as long as I can :)
,yodakun,2009-11-16T09:56Z,"To show the files included in this torrent, simply click on the link at the top showing the number of files in the torrent. This will work for any torrent that is not archived (i.e. .zip, .7z, .rar).

Cheers!"

,IrishMusic,2010-07-12T16:16Z,Try my version of all the best Irish stuff. I promise not to disapoint
,amaltia,2010-10-26T07:04Z,"I never knew what celtic music was, untill i downloaded this torret. Thanks a lot. I will seed"
,marjel,2011-01-21T11:56Z,"Man, I can not thank you enough! Irish music has always been by far my favorite (and I'm from Serbia). 
Do you have something from Aussie folk? I believe that's the branch from the same tree."
[V],rambam1776,2011-01-22T07:26Z,"There are a few Aussie and Aussie-related tunes here, but not too much."
[V],rambam1776,2011-03-17T07:12Z,Happy St. Patrick's Day 2011!
,rlogcabin83,2011-06-04T16:43Z,"Just stumbled across this.  Felt like I discovered a whole candy store just for me! Great! (By the way, your handle - rambam1776 - is one of the most intriguing I have ever seen. Brings up all sorts of speculation.)"
