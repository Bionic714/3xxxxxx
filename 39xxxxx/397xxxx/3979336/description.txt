My first attempt at a large torrent. This collection is my pride and joy â?? over 10 years of collecting Irish music, especially drinking songs. Many of these are nearly unique. There are multiple covers of famous songs, and most of the ID3 tags should be accurate by now. Iâ??m afraid I donâ??t know how to include a list of everything here in the torrent list, if anyone can tell me how, please do so. There are about 1,600 songs here. This is the ultimate collection for Renaissance faire fans, St. Patrickâ??s day, and hardcore fans of everything from Dropkick Murphyâ??s to the Three Irish tenors. Comments welcome - I think collections like this are the reason torrents exist!
