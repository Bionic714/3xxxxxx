Aapka comment dekh kar mein kush hogaya,  actually i am from asia only good guess. "
,oknitro,2008-01-28T01:19Z,"no rar in here, txt only, please add the rest"
,JanniR,2008-02-01T19:33Z,"Guys, the link to the RAR he talks about is in this torrent text file, it's just not shown in the read-me above, for some reason."
,saint_berzerker,2008-03-18T23:05Z,"For some reason, pdilli puts the link to the freaking rar file to some other site where you have to sign up and pay to get it.

Explain yerself, buddy?  Why can't you just put the file in the torrent here?

Pretty much showed yourself."
,saint_berzerker,2008-03-19T00:18Z,"^^^^^^  sorry for that comment!

You can download it w/o signing up...my bad.

Also, make sure you're using EXPLORER to download the DEFENDER!  NOT FIREFOX!  Haha.  It won't work right!"
,ibimba,2008-03-31T13:30Z,BRILL! sometimes you just need a serial number... thanks!!!!
,pdilli,2008-04-01T19:12Z,"@ Little Fingers

Hope you are about to mislead us....

Actually CDKEY resides in \I386\Unattend.txt
You will be able to find the CDKEY but it is not a genuine key."
,Zarrkorov,2008-07-26T06:43Z,YAY! it worked!
