,gigabetic,2008-01-20T02:49Z,it says i need iLok but cant seem to find it!
,U_Rebel_Scum,2008-01-22T07:55Z,"The ilok is a USB dongle key that you physically need for programs like this (digidesign).  I borrowed an actual windows copy of Pro Tools HD7 and installed it on my PC, but without digidesign hardware or an ilok key, I'm screwed.

Sounds lie someone out there needs to crack a dongle ilok bypass.
"
,t0k3s,2008-01-22T14:51Z,This torrent works fine follow the easy instructions .when you add the crack file make sure you copy and paste rather then drag or it wont work.
,jcpoker508,2008-02-16T08:07Z,why is there 3 copys of every file
,Aequitas12345,2008-02-19T17:56Z,Has anyone got this working without a dongle or iLoc?
,Aequitas12345,2008-02-20T16:24Z,This does work without an iLoc or dongle. But i do have an M-Audio Fasttrack Pro.
,definfected,2008-02-20T16:27Z,How do I get the mp3 function to work?  It says it's out of date.  Thank you to whoever helps.
,dougherox,2008-02-26T04:54Z,some who found out how it worked could u please give me the directions how in a more detailed version.
,dougherox,2008-02-26T04:54Z,i dont know how to crack the directions dont make sense
,Labilis,2008-02-28T21:19Z,"I understand that you have to copy and paste the files listed in the CRACK folder to the folder specified by the readme file, but i'm not clear on whether or not you need an ilok.   If I go buy an audio interface by M-audio or Digidesign then hook it up to my computer and run protools, will an authorization still be required, or will this download of protools simply work with just my Windows XP and an M-box?"
,dac44,2008-03-13T21:48Z,"It says in need ILOCK... any way to go pass this?. I understand what it is but since WE ARE ALL DOWNLOADING THIS through a torrent I assume nobody else has this......, therefore, again: How do I pass the ILOCK?"

,Nadsokor,2008-03-27T17:07Z,"Before Pro Tools you must install the interlock drivers (PACE Anti-Piracy). Then install PT and patch.

I then went to digi design and got the free update to version 7.4c4 i installed it and it asked to be authorized, i then took the .exe file in folder 1 (CRACK) and overroad the .exe in the program files folder. (i had to do that because the update 7.4c4 changes the .exe around). I wanted to know if you got urs working, and if u didn't, try it my way because i now have 7.4c4. I just hope that this will work the the fast track ultra. Otherwise it has no probs. Well no MP3 crack haha, but that's fine."

,Amillio,2010-07-13T00:43Z,@ xdlxsilonnYou need to be running xp sp2 only works with sp2 whith that securety update
,jtayl711,2010-07-16T07:43Z,you still need an m-audio interface for this correct?
,KidDisaster,2010-08-01T11:39Z,"Hey folks. I can answer quite few questions regarding Pro tools and this particular version.

1. Any and All ProTools programs require a certain hardware to run it. Including any DigiDesign hardware (M-Box, M-Box2, ect.) or M-Audio (For M-Powered, Fastrack, Fastrack Pro). Yes, the hardware must be installed and the computer has to recognize it. There is no opening protools without it. Even with just the drivers.

2. iLoks are an actual USB device. It's a small blue USB plug that looks like a key. It holds authorization keys for over 200 programs. Including ProTools 8 or M-Powered 8, also alot of plugins for earlier ProTools. So, if you see an iLok request window for 7.4, it's probably a plugin. Locating said plugin maybe a task, but once you've found it, simply remove it, and ProTools will open (provided you meet the other requirements.)

3. No, M-Powered 8 or just regular ProTools 8 has not yet been cracked. With the new security protocol used in the production of 8, cracking it will take a team of highly trained military personel and plenty of nuclear scientists. So if you're looking to upgrade or find it. You better have some cash on hand. 

4. There are many glitches and problems with torrented versions of many softwares. Including this one, regardless if the uploader has included everything needed. Files can become corrupted or coding can get screwed up. Resulting in missing files, corrupted files, or just ridiculous requirements to run the program.

5. If you do get ProTools running, torrented versions can still have problems. For instance, mine included the Beat grid not showing up. At all, even in grid mode. I would highly suggest buying the program for full, user friendly usage. (All purchased versions include the program, plugins, and any iLoks needed. Even possibly a few demo disks.)

6. I am currently running M-Powered 8. It is wonderfully fantastic. In my opinion. Starting with earlier versions is simply a waste of time. 8 is much more user friendly and much more flexible with the creative mind than the old versions. If you can think it, you can do it.

7. Lastly, for those of you who do have this question, becuase I hear it alot ""How can I succesfully hook up my keyboards and controllers?"". You can find your answers all over. But I'll answer it here. 

1 - Make sure you have either a Midi wire (I'm using a UM-1 Midi Wire) or a USB to USB (Refer to the keyboard to figure out what type.) or both! 

2 - Make sure you have the necessary drivers (It's usually a brand name driver. For instance, my controller/sequencer is a Yamaha M0-6. So I downloaded Yamaha drivers.)

3 - Install your driver(s) before hooking anything up. 

4 - Hook up your hardware by whatever means necessary. Make sure the hardware is ON. 

5 - The ""Found New Hardware"" wizard will appear, do not allow it to automatically find the driver. Manually do it, and pinpoint the drivers you installed.

6 - If done correctly your computer will recognize the hardware (In my case, Yamaha M0-6) and you will be ready to play!

7 - Open ProTools and open your Midi Setupid or your Hardware Setup window.

8 - Make sure your inputs and outputs show your connected hardware, name the hardware. Save and close. 

Boom! Ready to make some tunes!

Thanks."
,iLLiNoiZBoi,2010-08-04T13:35Z,"i am on windows 7, followed every step exactly. im not a noob. i even tried running in xpsp2 compat. everything installed fine with no errors but i cannot run protools. i get an application error."
,Adam(DJ),2010-08-21T01:58Z,"This will not work with IE8. Internet Explorer 8 kills legal Pro Tools too. It took me hours to realise why it wouldn't work when previously it worked great. 

Also use old M-Audio drivers from their website click 'show older drivers'. The new ones do not work with this. I have Delta 1010 and Firewire Audiophile.

Make sure you install digi translator, during setup. This allows import of OMF's.

It does still work great.

ps. Air's cs3 update works too."
