,otsegonaut,2008-02-17T00:14Z,did you use an iso burner to burn it to the disc?
,_Davis_,2008-05-03T12:33Z,BIG thanx!!!!!
[T],SgtRlee,2008-09-24T08:14Z,"Just to help anyone who doesnt want to burn this and instead wants the VOB files on your HD, just right click on this completed .iso file and choose ""Extract Here"" 
i use the program WinRAR 3.71 (i'm sure WinZIP also works) and that's what handles the extraction perfectly though it does take a few minutes :)"
[T],SgtRlee,2008-09-24T08:18Z,"oh, i forgot to add that i'm currently seeding this everytime i run Vuze since i read that this DVD was never released. Thanks for uploading it otsegonaut :)"
,Fledge,2010-04-23T10:23Z,"hello, thanks for this torrent. please leave the dvd online and continue seeding.
it's too hard to get the original dvd in any ways. the dvd is out of print and some guys selling the dvd for over $200 and more on ebay and amazon.

to the seller: fuck off.

to the torrent seeder: SALUTE & HOLY YEAH!!!! :)"
