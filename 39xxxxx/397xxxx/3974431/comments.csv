,Evil_Egon,2008-01-25T21:02Z,Schill_TPB how did you get this into your k850i? And where can i find the files when inside the phone itself? 
,jura_trean,2008-01-31T17:26Z,"stefan3333,
ja znaju "
,Schill_TPB,2008-02-04T01:05Z,"Either sending from PC via bluetooth or using the cable and relevent software.
On a K850 it will either be in applications or Games depending where you install it to."
,kobby,2008-02-05T02:30Z,"Great upload Schill_TPB
LG Viewty users must send the jar files via bluetooth,  The standard LG suite will not allow you to transfer .jar file via USB - and not all the games will work with the handset!"
,jollanbero,2008-02-05T16:30Z,put the jar file into the map ¨other¨ on your phone when its linked to the computer. Then you go inside the phone and go to ¨other¨ and then just install it :)

,franfred11,2008-02-13T12:41Z,"nope, kobby.
the easiest way of putting stuff on your viewty is by getting a micro sd memory card and using it.
connect your viewty (using mass storage option)  to yur pc and copy and paste the file on yur memory card.then on yur viewty go to others and install the game.bdw, the extension has to be - .jar"

,Schill_TPB,2008-02-14T01:43Z,"Yeah, seeding again.
Sorry, been away for a few days and I guess this has picked up a lot of hit and runners as its now had a total of 2000 downloads on another tracker so far!
Will seed for the next 18 hours solid again.
Thanks to all the other posters for the advice and comments.
If anyone has any other little gems of wisdom or probs then let us know.

Cheers."

,ThaDrizzle,2008-11-10T07:22Z,"I have a HTC Shadow and it's been a nightmare getting games and apps. I hope most of these work.  I am pretty sure mine have to be java so, unless you know more about javaruntime w/e than me the copying them w/ BT or a cable from a running java enviroment sounds like a winner.
But, by all means anyone.  Correct me if I am wrong.

Oh, and thanks anyways Schill.
Wish us luck."
