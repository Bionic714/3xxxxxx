Jag 2007: Enhanced Divx Set


Jag 2007 is an updating of the Jag Torrents online. Thanks to all who uploaded the original torrents. Jag 2007 has all the episodes from JAGs 10 year run on TV.

Each of the 227 epiodes have been recoded using the Divx 6.7 (for video).  The Xilisoft Video Converter in addition, to controlling the Divx 6.7 codec, also took care of the AC3 audio. The produced files sacrified size for excellent sound and good video quality. All files have 192bps/44100hz audio with Dolby 5.1 sound with a divx cerified dvd player. Video was at sampled at 1200 bps with a screen resolution  of 720x480 @30 frames per second.

The 5.1 sound using a divx certified dvd player is quite stunning. Visually, original files meant for monitors or TVs scaled up with very good results. On a 50" samsung running 1080I resolution video was clean, crisp, clear with very nice shading. You'll get the best results sitting a full eight feet away from the screen.

These torrents are going up one at time. When there are a couple of seeders for a torrent another torrent will be posted. As you can see there are 13 torrents in the set so it is everybodys interest to 'seed , seed, seed!!!!'
