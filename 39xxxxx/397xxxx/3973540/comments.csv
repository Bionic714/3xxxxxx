,knightshine,2008-09-13T11:40Z,Might be me but the spoken lang is not English.
,dentman,2008-12-08T22:48Z,"Language: Italian 
Miscellaneous: Language: It's never explained whether Dalmas speaks fluent Italian, or whether all the Italians (including the imprisoned pimp) speak fluent English. Furthermore, the computer print-out at the forensics lab is for some reason in English. "
,citysymphony,2009-08-16T13:25Z,"The thing with Argento movies is that they almost always are in both English and Italian, and almost always dubbed to the language that the actor doesn't originally speak. It's weird for sure and i채m not sure why they did it like this... anyhow, looking forward to see this movie!"
