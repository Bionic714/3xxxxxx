This game features an underground import racing scene, on which the player's
 main objective is to gain respect and affection of various females in the city.
 This is featured in a way that the player must win a variety of respect 
challenges to attract girls and maintain a good victory streak in order to 
ensure that they remain with the player. Once in their car, the girls will 
present the next open race that the player enters. As the player continues to 
win races, dance videos will be unlocked for viewing.

The game has 50 licensed cars from a variety of manufactures, including models 
from Toyota, Mitsubishi, Lexus, Subaru, and Volkswagen. SRS also features a car
damage model that forces the player to drive carefully, heavy damages may 
impact car performance and heavy repairs may drain the player of money earned
from their last race.
