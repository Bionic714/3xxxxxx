,fornozo,2008-02-12T16:19Z,how do i install this ???
,aquakid,2008-02-29T10:42Z,"This has installed, downloaded and installed ISQL tools, media manager seems to work, which is sometimes a failing with sony illegals !
Note that my first install was a failure, read the instructions and UNPACK everything until you cannot unrar anymore, then install, upon first use you will have to use the keygen and activate from another computer. Please don't do what I've seen some oter idiot do and actually ring the Sony help people. If you don't know how to do this, you won't be able to figure out the program.
Big thanks to the people at SSG."
