,IWantToLive,2008-03-10T01:25Z,Is it in english or japanese?
,Gods-Flaw,2008-03-11T06:31Z,"Japanese audio, english subs as stated in the above description..."
,IWantToLive,2008-03-12T05:34Z,Well i just wanted to make sure.
,bobdel,2008-04-11T00:01Z,"Thanks for having thsi one still up as I've bee ncollecting the epsidoes from dattebayo and have collected up to 50 to close to 120 from there.

Why was the first one's not up on dattebayo?

 Glad to get the first 1 to 49 EP here as I've enjoyed most of the episodes and have been watching these on YTV, but instead of continuing they restarted the sereis to the the 1st epsode now and we have to repeat everything from scratch and those buggers were so close to finishing the last episode as at 152 they restarted the series which had only a few to go 162 and should have at least finished up to the 163. Luckily Databayo had them starteed at 50 so I was alble to see where it ended only to have a new batch of episode begins at Episode 164.

Hope the series contunes for some time t ocome.    

Could somebody post how many episodes were in the first series 1 and how many series has their been up to 166 to date as far as databayo has at the moment"
,Gods-Flaw,2008-04-12T02:47Z,"bobdel, DB did not start subing until episod 50.  Lunar anima did the subing until it was licenced, then stoped and pulled thier downloads from the net.

Not sure what your question is on the seasons but know that you can get all episodes and available movies at DB which are not in this torrent."
,ValiousRiktor,2008-07-28T12:06Z,"If you are interested in the seasons (in Japan, they are called arcs, but are essentially the same thing) there is a page about it on wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_episodes
It's currently on the 8th arc. Thanks Gods-Flaw for putting this up. I can't believe how active it still is."
,Jason_sthlm90,2008-12-26T14:52Z,"Im more of a Naruto fan but i have to give Bleach a shot, thx for the ul:)"
,TailsClock,2009-04-12T11:43Z,They all seem high quality and great. I'm so glad I found these episodes again. I had them earlier but thanks to some idiot have had to download them here. I had completely forgotten how good Bleach used to be. The earlier episodes are so many times better than the later ones. Thanks a lot to all you seeders and to the uploader!
,Skilly9k,2009-04-17T12:06Z,please seed some more if possible
,efclear,2009-10-11T22:26Z,"While I admit there are the issues with BLEACH, like bankai, etc., getting effectively weaker over time (just like you have in DBZ), I'm curious as to why all these people keep talking about BLEACH being so much worse than it was?

Admittedly, I react the same way to a lot of other shows that people kvetch about, so maybe I'm just weird (wait, ""maybe""?!!), but if someone else could enlighten me regarding this particular situation, I'd appreciate it.

Also, thanks for torrenting the first 49 eps: I shrunk them before, but then discovered the enormous quality increase when using multi-pass encoding, so I'm re-encoding all of them. If anyone wants me to upload them in MPEG-4 @ ?80MB per episode, let me know. The video size will be smaller, but it remains smooth."
,MeitanteiKun,2011-11-23T03:01Z,"Gods-Flaw Do you know where I can I download the rest of the bleach episodes that Dattebayo subbed? Well, I wanted to download all their releases which I don't have anymore so I thought I would ask."
