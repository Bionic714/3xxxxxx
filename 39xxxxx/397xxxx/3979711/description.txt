Synopsis
What if anything were possible? What if the stage became a fantastic world where the old were young again, and where the kings were clowns? And if that were ALEGRíA, what would you make of it all? Wherever ALEGRíA has passed, its refrain of folly and irreverent laughter echo still. Its magic and joy spring from a world turned upside down.
