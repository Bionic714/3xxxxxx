,SoundAdviceCT,2011-04-20T22:27Z,"Torrent file doesn't load any trackers (incorrect, expired?).  To load trackers, headad over to btjunkie DOT org and search (""The Wire"" pieces), same torrent is named ""The Wire Soundtrack (...and all the pieces matter)"".

Before... absolutely no response, after... 5 minute d/l!

Regardless, thanx for the up!"

,Moops420,2012-08-01T14:02Z,"BitJunkie is actually Vuze, which is a bunch of horseshit where Vuze tries to force you to buy the deluxe model for 25 bucks, and tries to load yet another search bar and other shit you don't really want (choose the custom download if you don't want a bunch of crap on your browser). It might be worth all the bullshit if BitJunkieVuze  worked any better than Bittorent for the download, which it doesn't. Fuck Vuze!"
,Moops420,2012-08-03T03:37Z,"WARNING: FAKE DOWNLOAD! Here's more facts about Scrotumlicker's scam download: If you go to btjunkie, it will load a search bar (even if you specify that you don't want the search bar), and that search bar (called starwebsearch) will take over EVERY browser on your computer, and will be impossible to uninstall, even if you uninstall your browser and reinstall. It took over my IE Explorer, Mozilla, and crashed my Chrome browser. The comments that direct you to btjunkie are fake too, and probably written by Scrotumlicker as well. You'll be sorry if you mess with these files. "
