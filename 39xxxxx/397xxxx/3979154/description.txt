HARDtalk - Sir Edmund Hillary (BBCNews24, 11 January 2008) [TVrip Xvid] 


Recorded in 1999, Tim Sebastian talks to national hero Sir Edmund Hillary who in May 1953 was the first man ever to climb the highest mountain on Earth; Mount Everest and who sadly passed away yesterday.

Everest is approx. 30,000 feet - which is the altitude of a typical passenger airplane, amazing.

Tim asks him was Mount Everest his greatest achievement? Does he still feel bitter and responsible for the air crash in March 1975 which claimed the lives of his wife and daughter? 

Why wasn't he happy at receiving his Knighthood from the Queen? and; if it was possible, would he do anything different if the clocks could be turned back?
