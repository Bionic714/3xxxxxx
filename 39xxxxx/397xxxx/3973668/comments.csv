,azoozz,2010-02-08T03:37Z,"thanks to a poste on one of my torrents I have found a sequel to ""Pillars of the Earth"". I loved that book hope this one is as good. I love the unabridged versions. it allows for a full understnding about the characters"
,arwenelle,2010-10-04T15:00Z,"Very disappointed.  It took several hours to download this audiobook.   At first it played just fine, then around 11 mins it began to stutter until there was no way to understand a word of it.  I am using Quicktime player (windows one stopped working for me years ago)."

Quality is ok, not great, but book is complete and certainly listenable.

(arwenelle seems to have personal issues)

This is the sequel to epic ""Pillars of the Earth""
