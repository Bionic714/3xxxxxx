Might it be some broken file or something? Since im seeding 50kbit/s and i get 0Byte down.."
,LukinT1,2008-04-29T22:44Z,wtf is wrong with this? im still on 74.8% and there is 0kbit/s download speed.. why? is it because none seeds? I do seed 50kbit/s atleast but if none else does its useless since then i only upload while i myself cant get it down >.
