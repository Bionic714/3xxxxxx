Why dont you go to K-mart and but yourself some fucking taste. 

Yeah, these songs may be more mainstream, but the most off mainstream you get is NIN. So go fuck yourself. And besides... indie electronic music may be better to you, but to most people, this is the best electronic music available.  Ansd besides. your indie SHIT wont ever make a chart. thats why THIS is the TOP 100 TECHNO & TRANCE. Get it now? Its Billboard top 100. Mainstream. Fuckin a. Arrogant prick."

I'm thinking that the problem here is the definition of Trance and Techno, and this entire torrent is neither of those genres.  It's entirely housepop garbage.  So if you ACTUALLY like trance and techno...don't download this, because it's complete shit. 

Once cholo24 learns what trance and techno is...I'm sure he or she will post a good torrent, in the meantime look elsewhere for it.  "

You should label this as Top 100 Happy Hardcore Songs of All time - 2008.

I'm not saying this torrent is bad. It's just not my taste. Anyone who is into the real shit, good hard ol' trance, even epic trance... you won't find this the slightest ammusing.

If you do then clearly this doesn't fit your description.

God give us something good one day..."
