,pongeryding,2008-10-08T14:50Z,"Of course it comes up as a trojan, it's a exe file that changes the way your pc recognises the cd-drive. plus its has no doubt been reported by SI Games to anti virus makers as a no no.  So your anti virus flages it. idiots.  it does exactly what it says and no more.

You will have to exclude fmloader.exe from your antivirus software so that it will let you run it.  but you probably don't know how to do that.

Oh yeah and thanks YBS - 1 for the up and 2 for writing so much and letting me know exactly what I'm getting!"
