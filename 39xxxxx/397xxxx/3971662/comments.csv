I just bought a new burner to get rid of this problem yet my music is still ripping at random rates. Does anyone know why this is? I am running on Windows XP and my burner is a Sony 52x/32x/52x. I have tried ripping at some different speeds and also made sure my audio program was the only running process. I thought there was something wrong with my burner because it wasn't ripping any higher than 190kbps so I bought a new one and now it will reach 320kbps but only with the majority of ripped tracks.  My old one was burning fine and so is the new one I recently bought so it's just trouble ripping."
