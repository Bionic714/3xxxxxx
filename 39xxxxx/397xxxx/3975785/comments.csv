,Morroth00,2008-05-31T22:27Z,"Guys don't bother with this torrent. It's just 54 minutes of biking and no MASH :( Anyhow, it's not real, just a crappy homemade biking video."
,stvrulez,2008-06-07T20:16Z,"Dear Morroth00, i am sure, if someone downloads this movie its because he searched specifically for this, just read the description, there is a link to the homepage of the movie...."
,c0mbatkid,2008-07-09T23:37Z,"great torrent, great film, thanks a lot"
,the52poet,2008-07-22T04:37Z,"I got here myself by searching for MASH the movie.
I was thinking more of MASH 4077, Radar, Hawkeye, etc.; not some bicycle kids...
Ah well, back to my search."
,Roshin,2008-07-27T10:15Z,"@ Morroth00...

It cuts both ways, mate. A lot of people accidentally downloaded the Mash movie when they were really looking for this... :)"
