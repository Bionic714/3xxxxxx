ahhh gawddamnit, sorry folks, the torrent is FUBAR. Stuck at 20%.
My wife (bless her heart) deleted this file before it was seeded.

I got it from usenet but it's already gone from my ISP's cache so I can't get it again.
It will be on the paid usenet servers like newshosting for the next 3 months and there does seem to be some full sources for it on the ed2k network, so if anyone wants to get it you can try from usenet or edonkey. 

usenet nzb; (you need usenet access - http://www.slyck.com/ng.php)

edonkey link; (you need emule installed - http://www.emule-project.net)
ed2k://|file|The.Truth.About.Binge.Drinking.WS.PDTV.XviD-REMAX.avi|733947904|F380C5CE064A47F32EAB987EDFB25C30|/


If you have the file, can you finish seeding the torrent for people, thanks.
(click torrent download and when it askes where to save the file point it to the location of the avi, it will quickly check it and then start to seed it.)


otherwise can staff delete this post. sorry about that, .... win some, lose some and all that. ;)"
