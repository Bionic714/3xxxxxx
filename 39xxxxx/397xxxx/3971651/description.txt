*** Plot Synopsis by Mark Deming 
Four people get a crash course in the difference between love and desire in this independent drama. Ellis (Kuno Becker) and Renee (Eliza Dushku) are a young couple who\\\\\\\'ve grown tired of one another, and though they\\\\\\\'re still in love, they aren\\\\\\\'t sure how to reignite the spark in their relationship. Elsewhere, James (Macaulay Culkin) and Heather (Alexis Dziena) are another young couple who are having trouble in the bedroom; he\\\\\\\'s not as attracted to her as he once was, and she\\\\\\\'s determined to do something about it. Heather arranges for her and James to attend a lecture by relationship therapist Dr. Wellbridge (Joanna Miles), where they meet Ellis and Renee. In a private meeting with Dr. Wellbridge, the two couples are encouraged to swap partners as a way of breaking up the monotony and confronting their problems, but after a few days together the four know more about one another and their troubles than they ever expected to learn. Sex and Breakfast was the first feature film from writer and director Miles Brandman.
