,funkydom,2009-01-07T08:39Z,"Hey thanks for the post, but just one problem... why am i stuck at 99.1%?  This happens to me frequently with music.  I always get to 99ish percent then it stops.  Anybody else have this problem?

ps. i use bitcomet, dont know if that affects anything"
,BlueFdg,2009-01-25T16:50Z,"Quality really sucks 2/10, one of the worst rip ever. :-(
Tested with Winamp/VLC/KmPlayer/Media Player (Windows) and Amarok (on Kubuntu Linux).
Sound blaster audio + amplifier + pro loudspeakers.
Voice is horrible, annoying. Maybe could be suitable only for use with a portable mp3 player listened on a noisy train. :-)"
