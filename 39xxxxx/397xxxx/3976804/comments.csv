,indymuaddib,2008-02-15T20:10Z,"correct, this is for the AK-47/AK-74/AK-M not the SKS"
,cobanija,2008-03-20T10:43Z,Do you have AGI video about Springfield Armory XD perhaps? Thanks for other videos you uploaded          
,metalgear138,2008-04-07T10:48Z,"This video is ""building the AK"" not SKS, which makes it even better. Thanks! "
,C_Rex,2008-10-09T04:15Z,"Excellent!  This will really help me.  I've been planning to build an AK from a parts kit for a while now, and this shows me how easily it can be done.  No having to borrow a hydraulic press from work!"
