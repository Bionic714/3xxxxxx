,drax12,2008-02-01T08:23Z,Thanks for posting. It's divided into 8 packs. Could some one tell us what each one contains as I only need Absynth and Battery. 
,gorejuice,2008-02-02T08:42Z,"Absolutely sure about it not being 'AU' as well as VST etc....?

Don't wanna miss out if it is, don't wanna wait for such a large d/l if not!

@drax12
Disc 1 and the Patches folder are required to install and use Komplete 4. The other discs contain the libraries. The following table can be found in Welcome.pdf on the first disc:

Elektrik Piano Library | Disc 1 | 1.3 GB
Kontakt 2 Library part 1 | Disc 2 | 7.5 GB
Kontakt 2 Library part 2 | Disc 5 | 8 GB
Battery 3 Library part 1 | Disc 4 | 0.6 GB
Battery 3 Library part 2 | Disc 5 | 3.1 GB
Battery 3 Library part 3 | Disc 6 | 8 GB
Reaktor Legacy Library | Disc 1 | 0.5 GB
Akoustik Piano Library | Discs 5-8 | 15 GB"
,sprfreak14,2008-02-02T13:19Z,I just realized there's a typo in Welcome.pdf. Kontakt 2 Library part 2 is on disc 3 not disc 5.
,drax12,2008-02-03T12:51Z,Thanks sprfreak.  Unfortunately I'm on dial-up so the file's just to big.  If any one feels charitable; maybe you could chop the kontakt library into 500mb pieces. Cheers all.
,ajcism,2008-02-09T20:21Z,Where will I find the keygen? I can't find it anywhere.
,509sFinest,2008-02-15T20:09Z,Dam man 23 days estimated after 6 hours of downloading... Come On Peoples Seed it up! 
,Selulance,2008-02-18T20:06Z,"HERES HOW YOU GET SERIAL:

Disc 1 > PATCHS > a-nikom4p.rar
Inside this .rar file, lies the keygen. took me like 3 hours to find it. 

REMEMBER: Don't install the program / patching the program meanwhile you are connected to internet (pull cable out). It might make the registration invalid, and will make program useless. (So I read...)"
,Kelzar,2008-02-25T16:36Z,"1st of all thanks for the great upload. Now one question. Well, i have downloaded it, i installed the Komplete thing, using the keygen serial generator, after that I began to copy and install all the library ( akoustic, etc...) and after all this things i used the Amplify patch, the normal one, because i dont have the rtas or dxi, it says patch done, all ok, afther this i register the akoustik piano,. Now i can run all he program on the stand alone version ( but the b4, it says a file ..something like tonewheel dll or something like that ... is missing ) , so all them but the b4 work stand alone, but when i try to run the logic 5.5 i cannot run the kontakt 2, akoustik piano and b4 vsts, if i put their respectives .dll on the logic vst folder, when i run the program it crashes and says their register numbers are invalid .... Anyone have any idea about how to fix that?? Thanks and sorrry about my english i need to learn more hehe"
,kisiel_k,2008-03-02T17:41Z,Thanks for this great upload!!!
,tintobrass,2008-03-04T02:37Z,"""HYBRID Note: The release is tagged PC.ONLY but dvds are hybrid.""

So will this work on OS X or not? Thanks."
,kisiel_k,2008-03-05T19:34Z,"I have already had Kontakt 2, so I have downloaded only the 1 Dvd and parts 4 to 8.  
Can you tell me, please, is there anything special on Dvd 2 and 3 except Kontakt Library? Thank you for your answer, so I will not have to download it unnessecary :) 
Sorry for my english"
,grafikkort,2008-03-09T13:06Z,use a surplus keyboard as footcontroller for g rig2  works just fine  esp with loopmachine :)
,hitglenwithmycar,2008-03-11T00:56Z,I am  having the same problem as kelzar. The standalone programs work fine but when i try to load the vst into sibelius it says the serials for the programs arent right. when it gets to the b4 II it says it can not find tone wheels. Any help would be appreciated if not then this is only a half working crack!!!
,kisiel_k,2008-03-11T11:54Z,"In the ""Welcome.pdf"" file there is a note:

'The first two parts of the Battery library are installed to the selected folder by the installer on DVD 3. Please copy the Folder ?07 - Battery 3 Kits? to the folder ?Battery 3 Library? that has been created by the installer.'

Can somebody check the 3th DVD, please?
I already have the kontakt (legaly) so I dont want to download both second and third DVD. Is there anything except Kontakt Library on those Dvd's?
If anybody can answer my question and doesn't have an account, please write on: soplica(at)abv.bg

Thanks!!!"
,kisiel_k,2008-03-11T12:44Z,"to hitglenwithmycar: I am not able to install Komplete earlier than march, 20th. I will check this problem then."
,hitglenwithmycar,2008-03-12T18:27Z,the 3rd dvd only has the kontakt library.
,ArcImpulse,2008-03-14T13:49Z,Can you upload Native Instruments Komplete 5?
,fwed77,2008-03-16T21:54Z,"Hi
I've already downloaded Komplete for mac which doesnt include the librarys or samples, if i download this will i be able to extract the samples and libraries on my mac and put them into my mac compatible version of Komplete? thanks"
,trueshine,2008-03-20T19:18Z,"OK... i am usually good at this things but now iÂ´m completely lost!?
I got the 8 folders with each containing rar-files.
But when i start unpacking the first (with the install komplete etc..) it stops at 60%. It says it cant find the reaktor library bla bla...

WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH THE 8 FOLDERS CONTAINING THE RAR-FILES ?

Plleeeeeaaaaassseeee tell me!!"
,runelore,2008-03-26T17:00Z,"thanks a bunch man. i'll keep seeding this for a while!

10gb deep so far. few more days to go!"
,kisiel_k,2008-04-07T12:01Z,"Finally, it didn't work for me as a VSTi. If I run instruments in standalone mode, everything is perfect. But, in VSTi (in Cubase and FL Studio) it neads additional veryfication. 
So I've just used the library files and installed instruments from different torrents, it is working perfect.
The only programs which are truly working are:
Elektrik piano
Pro-53
Spektral Delay
Vokator

All the libraries are working but need programs from different realeases."
,mm4free,2008-04-10T10:17Z,kisiel_k - great info. Thanks Huge download and I would have been after the libraries. When will we get Kore 2- I wonder.
,atonofclay66,2008-04-10T23:08Z,I'm with ArcImpulse. Anyone have Komplete 5?
,GrandMaDeathSquad,2008-05-24T02:48Z,"Hi all!

I have a Windows XP machine and a MacBook. I successfully installed this on my XP machine without any hitches. And I copied over all the Kontakt, Battery library packs to my MacBook which had Komplete 4 installed from the other torrent available. Here's how I did it:

1. Unpack the 8 folders with WinRar
2. Mount each of 8 ISO files with DaemonTools or equivalant. (Important. Don't unzip ISO file with WinRar cos you get errors)
3. Copy contents of ISO files to hard drive.
4. Begin Installation process as detailed in NFO file provided.
5. Install Elektrik Piano and Akoustic Piano libraries afterwards.

Just to confirm, the libraries work perfect on the Mac version of Komplete 4! Any questions, email me at discotechno[at]gmail[dot]com 
Seed this file for others to use!! BYE

,BanthaRoyal,2008-06-29T17:24Z,this is an excellent Amplify pack presented in top form by the Poodler! ^ ^ sweeet
,dealerpriest,2008-07-09T21:07Z,"Reply to everyone with vst issues.

The Ampify-crack places the working VST-files in:
c:/program files/steinberg/vstplugins
(which isn't correct in non-english XP versions)

Hence you've gotta move them manually to:
c:/program/steinberg/vstplugins
(or wherever you've got all your vst's)"
,donjuandarko,2008-07-16T01:24Z,"Absynth 4 Help...

After having it installed for a few days, it begins crashing (the program just closes itself) whenever I press any of the panel (LFO, envelope, Patch, Perform, etc.) buttons.

This happens in the stand alone version and when using it with Ableton Live.

Thanks."
,possm88,2008-08-07T20:23Z,"im sorry, but i have no idea how to install this right. ive read all the posts, but dont think i can do it. im pretty new to torrent d/l's but this is the only one that i cant figure out. do i extract every single .rar, and what are these .r64,.r35, ect. files. also where are the .iso files and where/when do i install them. i bassicly need step by step instructions.i think that would help all who d/l this, not just me. thanks a million!!! "
,timbadd,2008-11-10T17:15Z,"You need to extract the .rar file underneath all the .r-- files. Don't open winace (if thats what your using) it said files were missing for me, just right click and choose extract to.. Should be straightforward from there on. Keygen is in a rar file in the patches folder."
,LennartAlsing,2009-01-03T23:42Z,"Thank you so much for this!

But the keygen.exe was really hard to find, peww."
,dwsb,2009-03-26T13:47Z,"can someone please point me to where the keygen is?

i've searched all the files for ""keygen"" and ""*.exe"" with no luck?
