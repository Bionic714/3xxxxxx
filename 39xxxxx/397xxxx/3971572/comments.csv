,egfan38,2008-01-11T20:20Z,I WILL UPLOAD THE GAUNTLET II WHEN I AM DONE DLING IT! I AM BUYING IT 2DAY FROM AMAZON!
,egfan38,2008-01-19T21:37Z,"Yo man, I just found a program that deletes protection so once I use it on the files, I will upload them."
,jdoenw,2008-01-30T02:38Z,"Any chance you could seed? I've been trying to keep the rest of the torrents you've started alive, since MTV ones are pretty rare, but the download idle on this one is > 9 days now, currently sitting at 83.7%. I'd be happy to keep it going for quite a while if you can jump back on for a bit!"
,engelbone,2010-05-10T01:12Z,Can we get this seeded. I am at 80% and will keep it uploading for a long period of time.
,Jewels-my-name,2010-11-11T00:51Z,"Sees PLEASE...I will seed for a few days if someone can seed now, stuck at 99.1% 
Thanks"
