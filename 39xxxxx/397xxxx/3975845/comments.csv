,artytorrent,2008-03-06T04:54Z,"Oh my God! I was reluctant to download such a huge zip file when there were no comments to indicate whether it actually extracted OK, but WOW!
This download was well worth the wait.
There are so many samples that I don't really know where to start, but the main folders are as follows:
Amped (42 folders of guitar samples)
Bass Case (102 multi-sampled basses)
Contagious Audio (8 folders of hits, stabs and fx)
Dream Padz (5 folders)
Generic (9 folders of drum oneshots and instruments)
Orchastral (sic) (21 folders)
Poly-Mono (92 synth multis)
SFX Insects
Superdrums 8000 (23 folders of perc oneshots)
The Lo-fi box (hundreds of drum oneshots)
Tovch Padz (36 multis)
Vocal Samplez CD (inc tons of vocoder things)
Vocals (6 folders of someone called Laurie)
World Samples (More percussion).

This might just be the best samplepack on TPB and I'm writing as someone who's posted over 100! (Click my name)

Thanks so much for sharing! Will seed for as long as possible, and I'll also have a go at converting some of these to DWP and Kontakt format for future upload at some point. Cheers!"

All good stuff people, well worth the time to download.
I have a question for you seasoned muso's though.
What do you use to play all the 'oneshot' samples? 
Do you turn them into something else for playing as an 'instrument' ?
Some advice for this newbie would be appreciated.

,MyGenius,2008-11-17T15:58Z,Perfect download! Makes my music rock!
,MyGenius,2008-11-17T16:04Z,"DWARKA---- You should be able to unzip it directly to the sample-fusion folder (i.e. - ~~\Image-Line\Shared\Data )
It will have its own folder called Sample Fusion.
If you're running Fruity Loops it will then be available in the browser on the left-hand side under ""Data"". It plays all the samples in the pack and they're perfect!

~~Thanks asrntrgb!!"
