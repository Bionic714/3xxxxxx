Transformers Zone


The final episode of the Transformers G1 series released as a OVA in 1990.

for more information see: 
http://transformers.wikia.com/wiki/Zone

This episode has been released online several times over the years but this is a brand new rip taken from the official DVD released in japan in 2004.

This new rip includes a new set of english subtitles which i created using my knowledge of transformers, the tf wiki and the old bootleg subtitles. i am in no way fluent in japanese so some of the translations may be a little off but its as close as i could get.
