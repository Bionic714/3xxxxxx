MOViE iNFO:
The newest DVD filmed during the November 2005 regional tour of Australia
This new DVD has music not included on any other Tommy Emmanuel products.
The multi-camera footage captured at Her Majesty's Theatre in Ballarat sees
Tommy joined on stage by his fiancee Elizabeth Watkins, a young, accomplished
singer/songwriter from Delaware in the USA. There's no doubting the magical
chemistry between these two. And for the first time on an audio/visual
recording, we get to hear Tommy sing as well.
