[V],Kuthumi,2008-01-14T07:09Z,"This is the film ""Volunteers"" from 1985 with Tom Hanks, English sound with burned-in Norwegian subtitles."
,pflagger,2008-01-17T23:03Z,"As far as I remember ""Rektrutter paa ville veier"" was the Norwegian title for Stripes (1981), not Volunteers (1985).  The title means something like ""Recruits going crazy"".  Volunteers isn't about recruits, Stripes is.  If this is Volunteers, the title given is wrong."
,pflagger,2008-01-17T23:04Z,"And it's actually ""Rekrutter på ville veier"", not ""Rektrutter..."""
,pflagger,2008-01-17T23:08Z,"Confirmed that the title is for Stripes (1981).
Haven't downloaded this though, so I can't say what's actually in the torrent."
