  NOTES:
    
    In the chaos of a new generation, one rider named Sam Hill has 
    made a statement by winning the World Championships and the 
    World Cup overall in the same season, but more than just race 
    results his influence on the sport will run deep for many years. 
    With every top rider pushing harder and faster than ever before, 
    The Law of Fives captures each aspect of this incredible race season, 
    but when the clock has stopped running the hungry young guns keep 
    pushing the limits just for the camera, and in a last effort to 
    understand Sam Hill's incredible skill he is put to the test on 
    the 1:04 Dirt Magazine private test track.
