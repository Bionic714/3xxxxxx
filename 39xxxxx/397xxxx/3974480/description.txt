As the title, Franquins Sorte Sider might suggest, these stories explore depressive and horrific fantasies, all drawn with dramatic use of black on white. Suicide, execution, industrial recklessness, ecological disaster and hunting accidents are some of the themes darkly illustrated in this body of work. The series contrasts sharply with Franquins other comic strips such as Gaston Lagaffe (Vakse Viggo), Spirou et Fantasio (Splint & Co) and the Marsupilami (Spirillen).
