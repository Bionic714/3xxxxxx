[T],FaeGiN,2008-03-28T11:39Z,"Yes this gives errors during extract with winrar but...thanks for the tip about 7-zip.  even better if you dont want to mess up your system file associations already as they are, go get the portable version of 7-zip. you just download it and run the file...it then can extract the film for you and then you still use winrar or whatever you usually like as an archiver program.  great!

,redcom2,2008-09-13T23:14Z,"Whoa, 7-zip is not the problem.  The real retards are those who dont understand that it's hostile to foist obscure formats on people, when there are perfectly good standard formats like ZIP, RAR, ISO, etc that everyone can handle already."
,LEENOCKS,2008-09-13T23:34Z,"You guys do know that tarballs have been around long before RAR and even ZIP, right?
TAR has been used since tape drives were still common.
It's not an ""obscure format"" by any streach of the imagination."
,redcom2,2008-09-14T01:27Z,"This is a bastardized version of TAR, cut up into 15 meg sections which even the 'tar' program cant handle, giving ''tar: Unexpected EOF on archive file''.
Being old is no excuse; TAR is as obscure as ZOO or ARJ or Z (except in *NIX, where obscure is normal).  And this bastardized version more so."
,Tobbe_j,2008-11-10T12:19Z,"Thanks, works perfectly for me. Seems like I'm the only who isn't retarded around here haha."
