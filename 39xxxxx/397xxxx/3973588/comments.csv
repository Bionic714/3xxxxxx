,Tsaparang,2008-02-28T11:40Z,"I've downloaded this torrent twice and I cannot get WinRAR to extract the files.  Instead, I get the following error messages implying that the .ro1 file is corrupted:-

Volkerball-rvb.r01: You need to start extraction from a previous volume to unpack RAMMSTEIN_VOLKERBALL.img

and:-

Volkerball-rvb.r01: No files to extract

Is this torrent recoverable or should I simply wipe the files and give up any hope?"
,Zero2Cold,2008-03-02T13:45Z,FILE IS CORRUPT JESH
,richard123,2008-03-15T13:38Z,HOW DO I FIX A CORRUPT FILE????
,Tsaparang,2008-03-16T12:27Z,"I have discovered how to Unrar this download by browsing the web forums for help.

Instead of clicking on the .r00 file (or .r01, .r02, etc), locate the .rar file (usually at the end of the list after .r92) and click on it.

For some reason (multiple volumes?), WinRAR 3.51 and 3.70 will only extract this archive if you select the Volkerball-rvb.rar file, as opposed to any other file.

The result is a .iso file."
