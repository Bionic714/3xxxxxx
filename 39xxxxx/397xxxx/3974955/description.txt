Formed in Glasgow in 1981, they were originally a quartet. By 1982 the band had been reduced to the duo of Jill Bryson and Rose McDowall, though Aztec Camera's Roddy Frame and then-future Cure drummer Boris Williams both appeared on some songs. In 1983 they released the single Trees And Flowers (a song about Bryson's agoraphobia) on an independent label, with little success ('Trees & Flowers' featured at number 47 in John Peel's 1983 Festive 50). In late 1983 they got signed by Bill Drummond to WEA records' subsidiary Korova. In early 1985, their first single release on that label, Since Yesterday, became a top 10 hit in the UK and met success in Europe and, especially, Japan . The track's opening fanfare came from Sibelius' Symphony No.5 and had also featured on the earlier hit "Beach Baby" by The First Class. The girls' strikingly contrasting black and white wardrobe, including the polka dot rah-rah skirts worn for the sleeve of Since Yesterday, attracted some coverage at the time. Their somewhat "Gothic" appearance was also of note.
