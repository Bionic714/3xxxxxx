NEW VERSION 0.30 Released! Download it!
Control Games with Gestures, Speech, and Other Input Devices!
With GlovePIE you can now play any game, or control any software or MIDI devices, using whatever controls you want. This includes joysticks, gamepads, mice, keyboards, MIDI input devices, HMDs, Wiimotes, trackers, and of course, Virtual Reality gloves! 

NEW! Wiimote Support!
Now you can use your Nintendo Wii Remote (Wiimote) to control PC games (or emulated games)! Also new in this version is support for TrackIR, FakeSpace Pinch Gloves, and Concept 2 Rowing machines. And it still supports the full range of other input devices added in the last couple of versions.

About GlovePIE
GlovePIE stands for Glove Programmable Input Emulator. It doesn't have to be used with VR Gloves, but it was originally started as a system for emulating Joystick and Keyboard Input using the Essential Reality P5 Glove. Now it supports emulating all kinds of input, using all kinds of devices, including Polhemus, Intersense, Ascension, WorldViz, 5DT, and eMagin products. It can also control MIDI or OSC output.

In the GlovePIE window you type or load a simple script. For example to control the WASD keys with a glove:

W = glove.z > -50 cm
S = glove.z < -70 cm
A = glove.x < -10 cm
D = glove.x > 10 cm

You can also use GlovePIE to play Joystick-only games without a joystick, or keyboard-only games with a joystick. Or you can use it to create macro buttons for complex keystrokes. 

You can even use it to control multiple mouse pointers with multiple mice.

System Requirements
You will need:

Windows 98 or above (Windows 2000 or above to emulate keys in DirectInput games or use multiple fake cursors - Windows XP or above to get input from multiple mice or keyboards individually or to read some special keys). 
DirectX 8 or above. 
There is other optional software you might need for certain features. See the download page for links to download them. Joystick emulation requires PPJoy. Speech requires SAPI 5.1 with microsoft recogniser.
You don't need any special hardware.
