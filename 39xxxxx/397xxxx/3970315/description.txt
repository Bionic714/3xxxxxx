In 2007 a group of CBSRMT fans acquired a number of vinyl records with CBSRMT programs on them that were used for broadcast on the Armed Forced Radio  Television Network.

They encoded these programs as mp3 files and made them available to collectors.

This torrent is all of the files from 2007. There are 79 programs totaling 3.15 Gigabytes.

Please seed if you download this and be patient.
