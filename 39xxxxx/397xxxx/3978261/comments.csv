Recently published scientific research states that most people don?t have first hand evidence of distant places. People only travel in a small area around their work and home. 

The whole world is living in a real Truman show/ Matrix.

What people know of the real world has nothing to do with real life experiences but is second hand from books, TV and the Internet.

Really great film must watch if you have not already seen."
,ettin,2009-05-22T20:16Z,"for 1.38gb the quality sucks, this should be visually lossless at this size, and it looks like what a decent 700mb rip should look like. "
,sybilfault,2010-01-17T22:45Z,"While I partly agree w/ ettin that this could be a bit better for the file size, it IS significantly better than the other popular 700 MB rip on TPB. I also forgive Marckos and some others for the somewhat lack of quality on these rather relatively early DVDs, b/c there's something about those source discs that makes them a bit lacking themselves in being able to make quality rips--even if this one was ripped and uploaded fairly recently (2008). So thank you for the best, most readily available copy of this film so far on TPB!

A: 7
V: 6.75   ;)"
,Joffah,2010-04-02T15:50Z,marckos please do not code any other upload with this codec.  This movie has a continuous flicking bar at the top of screen that makes this near unwatchable on my dvd player.
,Vety91,2010-10-23T04:04Z,"HeyFor more than 1gb quality is not good and has no sound, DO NOT DOWNLOAD PEOPLE.


DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"
,Phlil774,2011-01-06T22:31Z,"Very good quality. But for it's size, it's not exactly brilliant. But still the best torrent of it that I could find.
A9/V9"
,cooljoey1356,2011-02-20T01:49Z,"Don't Listen to these liars, near perfect quality
A: 9
V: 9
M: 10
Very fast download speed."
,krypking,2011-02-26T01:47Z,depends on what screen u watch it on i would think. all files of this size play perfectly on my computer (1440x900) and on my tv (32 inch). for the people who say the quality sucks are u watching it on a big screen hdtv?
,Elzarynn,2011-04-14T03:11Z,"How strange; the sound is all deep and electronic-sounding, as if it's playing at a slower speed. Do I need a special codec or something? Anyway, I'm going to delete the file and download it again and see if that helps. If anyone has a suggestion, I'd appreciate it."
