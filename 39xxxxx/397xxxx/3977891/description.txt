A package of over clocking software I have accumulated over time.

Over clocking is forcing your computer components to run at higher clock speeds than the manufacturer designated. This results in more performance. If you have never over clocked your computer before, read a LOT before using any of these tools beyond the monitoring software, as you can destroy your computer. Have fun
