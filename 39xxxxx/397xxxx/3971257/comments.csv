,bdragon125,2008-01-18T23:55Z,"thats odd cuz i got the gides from that torrent, so yes these are."
,xxernestoxx,2008-01-29T07:53Z,"Good looking out,
I had download the other one and lucky for me my new toon hit 20 tonight. Its not to late for me to use the current version."
,xxernestoxx,2008-01-29T07:57Z,"wait...ps.
Upon further inspection I checked and double checked and this and the version posted in this torrents comments are identical
blood elf 1.09 and azeroth 1.22 in both torrents.
I'm assuming it is revised because I had versions 1.06 and 1.11 already on my pc."
