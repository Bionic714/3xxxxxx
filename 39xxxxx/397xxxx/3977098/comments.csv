1. WireTap Studio vs WireTap Pro,
2. WireTap Pro vs Audio Hijack Pro ?"

Thanks"
,kingglade,2008-01-15T13:35Z,Thanks heaps for this.  Wiretap seems to be everything I wished Audio Hijack was - just basic audio capturing.  Appears to be much simpler and more reliable too..

this is cracked btw"

I used to use audio hijack but it kept skipping during the recordings, which obviously wasn't good.
So although I don't like the small interface, I do like wiretap more because it doesn't skip."
