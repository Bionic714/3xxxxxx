Error 503 Service Unavailable
Don't know what that means."
,LagmastaC,2008-01-17T05:02Z,"That's just a problem with the TPB server - I've gotten it on before on other torrents. If you just give it a few minutes, it should get cleared up. This is my first torrent so I hope everyone enjoys it =)"
,bfarber,2008-02-19T06:56Z,fantastic book.... read the e-book... then i bought a copy
,RainbowDissent,2008-02-29T14:15Z,"this is one hell of an overrated book. major disappointment after the way everybody goes on about it like it's the best thing in the world. no problems at all with the torrent though, good upload; keep it up :)"

,sunnybunny88,2009-02-25T00:04Z,"When i try to open it with wordpad it becomes a bunch of incomprehensible text.

What am i doing wrong?

Do i need to mount it or something :S"
,jandrews23,2009-03-30T05:46Z,Wordpad will not open pdf.  You need a program to read the pdf.  I suggest Foxit; its free.

,shirlzknight,2011-02-21T01:18Z,"Has no one got the audio book? i own the paperback its great shit but i loved listening to Max Brooks World War Z after reading the pb version, anyone out there looking for more zombie related goodies? check out The Walking Dead graphic novel by Robert Kirkman published by image, don't be put off by the comic book format this is gripping stuff it must be its been running for 83 months that's a whole lotta undead.And do yourself a favor and purchase the books they just look so much better in print lol sorry back to the torrent excellent upload great book tyvm keep it alive keep seeding!!"
,shirlzknight,2011-02-21T01:31Z,"RANNIAN: Just thought id let you know that Zombie Survival Guide; Recorded Attacks is not a 'normal book' its a graphic novel and you will need a comic book reader if you opt for the digital edition, also you may like to check out ZOMBIES; A RECORD OF THE YEAR OF INFECTION. by Dr Robert Twombly published by Simon and Schuster. It's actually written by Don Roff and brilliantly illustrated by Chris Lane."
