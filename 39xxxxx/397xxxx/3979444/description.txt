Sadahnmo is a jazz guitarist,electronic composer and a devout innovator from India, the land of the ethereal raga. His music fuses sounds which are superficially robotic yet powerfully human. The melodies and soundscapes seem ethereal and everlasting. His music can be labelled as a motley of unpredictable psychedelic harmonies and glitchy break-beats with the groovemeter ticking at the max and a tinge of ambience topping it up. Being formally trained in the tabla, his groove is impeccable. 



'Music is a form of thought, thought is a form of perceived reality, and reality is a form of perception itself. All these can be interconnected and controlled with the right processes and application.

Logic is the key, it is what makes us human, in this age when machines rule. Multifaceted in my outlook, my music is just a representation of various phenomenon, be it personal or worldly, real or fiction, bounded or endless....It is a just a part of my constant struggle to find peace.'
