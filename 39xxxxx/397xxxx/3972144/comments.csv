,LILIAKU,2008-01-11T18:47Z,How's the quality ? Anyone downloaded this one ?
,DHTorrents,2008-01-11T19:02Z,"Quality is ok, totally watchable, but could be better"
,Mathelsom,2008-05-08T22:43Z,"thanks.

Does anyone know where I could find an mp4 torrent of this? I really want it on my ipod, I've searched like 100 torrents on TPB and on Torrent Portal but no one has an mp4.


thanks again!"
,venusd00m,2008-09-09T21:14Z,does it include English subtitles within it & not as an attachment? I have downloaded a torrent and I can't figure out the Spanish lines!
,andreli4,2008-12-12T06:00Z,Yes with Spanish already embedded.
,vivatpb5776,2011-05-04T22:56Z,"Excellent quality DVDRip. I am a little disappointed by the screen resolution and the split video but the embedded subs definitely make up for it. For those that care, I use AVS VideoRemaker to splice the two video parts together. Thank you uploader."
