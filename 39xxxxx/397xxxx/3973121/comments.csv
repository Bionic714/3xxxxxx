,amanshivalilive,2008-01-28T11:24Z,Will this work  only on dell machines?
,mcube,2008-01-28T15:36Z,"Windows Vista Home Premium 
Every Fast than any other vista version and it is lite version ...check the description and  comments for more info http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3991864/Windows_Vista_Home_Premium_Lite"
,rollcage4,2008-01-28T19:09Z,"@amanshivalilive 

I think this should work with all the machines ..

I dont have Dell machine will let you know after testing it,
I have finished downloading.. So seeding it :) "
,rollcage4,2008-01-29T08:58Z,"
Ya just tested it using VMware.. now I have Dell machine lol :lol: hehe

its working fine .. just try it .. its working

as I see the unwanted crap is removed, like annoying Defender (u can install later if you want,
games, wallpaper, some other stuff that make pc slow... regular Windows files untouched.

Just try it on man... its for those who dont want to download 4GB or want to run on non- dual core CPUs ..

It need only 256MB ram to run. after installation the harddisk was 1.5GB occupied only. :)
dont forget the pagefile makes a lot og space .. by default 1GB that u can shift to other drive.

And whats the best part id its not like annoying releases where the release name is written everywhere its completley clean.

good work :D"

,suitman,2008-02-08T21:26Z,"so, what exactly did you strip from this version. I currently have Home Premium Lite but it is mising sounds, games, defender, speech engine, and the ability to rename folders. Since yours is smaller that the Home Premium, what did you strip out?"
,leillox88,2008-02-08T22:07Z,"i downloaded this version and so far is GREAT! the only problem i've found is that you cant print with this, at least i tried and was impossible 1째 it doesnt have the printer tab in the Control Panel 2째 when i tried installing the drivers manually vista crashed saying that the registry class was invalid..... if any of you got a printer working please let ppl know... for the rest its a perfect mod of vista ultimate 100% activated..."

,jeepwifieco,2008-03-04T10:16Z,"hi everybody, first sorry for my english... the printer support have a solution... you have to enable ""spoiler printer service""... you must go to ""start->execute"", then type ""msconfig"" click on OK button, and in the new window search ""services"".. then in the list find the ""spoiler printer.."", check the square (marca la casilla, sorry but i don't know how to say that), then click on apply button and OK button.. .restart windows... mission acomplished... :D , now you can install the printer drivers.. bye :D "

,mcnabb08,2008-03-14T21:09Z,is windows media center included in this??
,HMPCAMPHILL,2008-03-16T11:42Z,"absolutely fantastic download....

mcnabb08- no its not

FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO KNOW WHAT THIS IS LET ME TELL YOU...

IT IS WINDOWS VISTA 32BIT ULTIMATE OEM VERSION. The oem was for DELL, but YOUR COMPUTER DOES NOT NEED TO BE DELL.

This is the lite version, has had some things taken out, dont worry about the printer problem its a simple fix!

All the branding on this version of vista is ULTIMATE and DELL... but you can make your own oemlogo to replace the dell one, or just delete it!

This download DOES NOT REQUIRE A SERIAL and is allready activated! you do not need to worry about a thing, and YES YOU CAN GET EXTRA UPDATES FROM MS as i have!


I run xp mce myself but installed this download with microsoft virtual machine. That way you can run vista within xp and really test it out before you migrate to it!

When you have it complete in virtual machine, install Norton Ghost onto vista and make a dvd of the hard disk... then boost it onto the REAL hard disk and hey presto!. Make sure you have burned a copy of this vista download though because it will ask for it!

trev@iowmafia.co.uk if you have any problems!"

,littledude565,2008-05-05T09:44Z,"Works fucking brilliantly. Heres what to do

1) download
2) use magiciso to imgburn to burn at the slowest speed 1X or 2X
3) Set the BIOS to boot from CD
4) When it prompts for you to hit any key. Hit anykey
5) Now this is what made me burn this twice, it will have the mouse on a pretty coloured screen, IT HAS NOT FROZEN ITS JUST TAKING ITS TIME DO NOT EXIT.
6) After about 5-6minutes or more of no responce, it will come up with the instalation options.
7) install and be happy with this amazingly fast vista (never thought i would say that) ^_^

ps, this is in english only, but it has differnent keyboard options. You can get more language packs via the windows update. any problem email me

No problems with printing and Aero works too.
Perhaps wireless won't work as I use dialup (CDMA/3G/EVDO, etc) and no router so I have no need for wireless stuff.

It is fast on my Duron 1.8GHz and 2GB of RAM.  It is 3 to 5 times faster VLite'd than the original Vista was.

To activate it:  I simply downloaded the Vista Loader 4.0.  Get Orbit_30's vista loader and you'll be good to go."
