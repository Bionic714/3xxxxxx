I have the same problem. Except after I installed the qt32bit file I could see an intro from hue forest, but after tat nothing, just black screen and no response. 

Script handling error #movutils and #newgame

anybody knows how to fix this?"
,byjj43,2008-04-09T17:13Z,"I will happily seed this if I can get it all. I just had a crash and had to reload my OS, so I am starting over with my uploads. Thanks."
,byjj43,2008-04-10T14:12Z,This was downloading at a snails pace so I found another site and downloaded it in an hour and a half. I am getting the same error codes though (Script handling error #movutils and #newgame) so it could be that this is too old of a game to run on XP. I have already tried changing compatability and video settings. If you find a fix for XP let me know.

,byjj43,2008-05-05T05:00Z,"Btw, my final solution was just to take an old hard drive and load Windows 98 on it for older games. Amber loaded up just fine today and I will play it if and when I get the time. Good luck."
,riplikethat,2008-06-02T06:13Z,"It worked fine for my on XP x64. I have found that for some reason, old games like this which never worked for me on XP x32 and Vista x32 work without any issues on XP x64. No idea why this happens but wth, I ain't complaining :P"
,riplikethat,2008-06-02T06:13Z,"Oops, x86 not 32 :P"
,Woof_Wuf,2008-06-20T10:26Z,"This the best horror game EVER created*period*. The CREEPIEST games I've ever played. Scared the living shit outta me and Ive played alot of horror games before - Shivers, Sanitarium, The Dark Eye blah, blah, blah (Just to name a few) but NONE of them had the same effect that this game had on me...

BTW, did anyone try launching this game by doing the following:
===============================
1. Click Start -> Run -> type dxdiag -> press Enter.
2. DirectX Diagnostic Tool has started. Click the Display tab.
3. Click the ""Disable"" button next to ""Direct 3D Acceleration"" and click OK to disable it.
4. Make sure the game is under Windows 95 Compatibility Mode
4. Try Launching the game afterwards. 
P.S.: (Alotta older games work this way)
===============================
If it doesn't work download  Microsoft's Virtual PC 2004 - create a virtual drive, Install an older OS on the virtual drive and play!! This method works 100%. Yeah I know about the 'effort' all, but TRUST ME! YOU HAVE GOT TO EXPERIANCE FEAR IN ALL ITS GLORY!!!"

I hope it works for you too!"
,rstarsteve,2009-01-03T08:00Z,"okay, someone PLEASE help with this! I got everything working FINALLY, and now that I'm well into the game, I have a problem...it freezes when I change the station on the radio in the bedroom. Anyone have a fix?"
,rstarsteve,2009-01-09T03:46Z,"okay, I'm at the final sequence, but when I type into the computer screen in the office, nothing happens. No text appears on it, then about 2 minutes after, the whole game crashes. Any idea what to do?"
,one900meat,2009-01-23T21:48Z,"Here's a link to an installer that will run this game with XP/Vista.  You still use this ISO to play, but do not install it from the ISO...Instead install the game using the downloaded MSI file.

,Atlas305,2010-02-03T19:06Z,"I am Downloading this (very slowly btw) but I will seed it for everyone for a week or so. I got this game because it is the only ""video"" game my girlfriend has ever liked... Thanks Luiz! really! Now I won't feel so bad playing MY games now that she has one to play.. :D"
,STBTRT,2011-07-26T14:56Z,thanks luizfalves this is a great game . this is far better than some of today's games.
