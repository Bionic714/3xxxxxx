,panzersiddhartha,2009-05-07T03:25Z,"Torrent info does not remotely match TPBs 'Albums by artist' list above even if I skip the ones labeled Live, but hey. Great upload! Thank you. 

To all: Nina Persson from The Cardigans have made a pretty nice cover of Walking The Cow with her new band A Camp. It is around in a few different versions, but the original CD album version is the best. Check it out."

,xMajesticMeteorx,2011-07-30T16:00Z,"Wow this is a pretty extensive bunch of audio files from 1981 till 2006.
He's essential a zombie at a microphone these days, so this is what you'd want right here from his earlier manic period.

His former manager uploaded this after Dan's brother brought complaint.  The poor guy never made much off Dan, but was kind enough to give some rare master tapes (cassettes, lol!) back to the Johnston family.

But paybacks are hell baby, and so now we can sift through Daniel Johnston's over hyped ""genius"" for free.

Daniel Johnston is currently incarcerated for a rape spree upon age 8 - 11 girls in 1984, whereby Dan would lure girls into his corn dog trailer and tie them up at a traveling carnival. "
,tekno-man,2011-08-15T07:04Z,"^ If that's true then who was/is touring all over the world? LoL... just check out his site.
