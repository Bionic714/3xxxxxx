Nursing, Why I Love My Work As A Male Nurse

In this video I describe why I love working as a Registered Nurse. I have been in practice for over a decade in hospitals, home health and nursing homes (rehabilitation centers).  Can see myself taking care of patients for as long as I am able.

This speech was given for Moorestown Area Toastmasters, http://www.matoast.org 
I have belonged to this club since 2004 and joined Toastmasters to improve my public speaking skills, get over my nervousness in front of groups of people while speaking.
