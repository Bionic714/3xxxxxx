This is a single iPod Audiobook file (.m4b) of the complete and unabridged definitive book on the sinking of the Titanic by Walter Lord read brilliantly by Martin Jarvis in 1998.

I got so tired of waiting for the CD version of this to come out, (and then it would probably only be the abridged version) I located this 6 cassette full version on eBay then ripped it to 12 parts, joined them together and recoded to play on my iPod.

If you want to convert back to mp3 just open iTunes, right-click on the file then select, Convert Selection To mp3.
