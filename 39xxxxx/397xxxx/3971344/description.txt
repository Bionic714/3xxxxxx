_____________________________________________________________Summary__

Modern television has the technical means to take us anywhere and 
show us anything. It can bring us the physical experience of war, 
with all its horrors, like no other medium. And yet the image of 
American war on television is increasingly disembodied, bloodless, 
and unreal. This film traces the development of the image of war on 
American television from Vietnam to the present day to understand 
why we see what we see when we look at war on television. It tells 
the story of how the perception of war has become as important as 
war itself. And it asks how democracy can be served if citizens are 
denied a true understanding of the daily consequences of the wars 
their nations fight.
