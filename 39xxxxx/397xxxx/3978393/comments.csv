,Flow_Jay,2008-03-04T09:17Z,seriously if ur worried about viruses then u shouldn't be doing this kind of work
,DaNtsu,2008-03-25T14:40Z,"contains a trojan downloader, what a shame, i wanned this one.."
,DaNtsu,2008-03-25T15:25Z,"haaha, it contains a trojan downloader AND it installs an extra version of the keylogger for some1 elses use :)"
[T],ony,2008-03-30T19:06Z,"hilarious ppl!

nice that your antivirus / spyshit works. it's the purpose of protection.. to DETECT keyloggers and stuff like that. you maybe should read som faq's or google false/postitive.. or atleast understanding what you're installing in the first place. :) 

try download the app from ardamax homepage.. i suppose it contains viruses and trojans also. :)"
,Shnoll,2008-04-09T16:36Z,"Then explaine us why the Ardamax keylogger remover doesn't see it when you try to uninstall it and why it stays hidden, like, REALLY hidden, when you do ctrl-alt-shift-H.

fucker"
[T],ony,2008-04-10T05:50Z,"i can't explain coz i haven't written the app. mail them and ask: support at ardamax.com

don't know what you mean with ""really hidden"".
there's options to hide it from task managers and shit.. look there... otherwise google is your friend...

download it from their own homepage if you're so afraid of spyshit... http://www.ardamax.com/keylogger/ :)"
,mamaloney,2008-04-11T02:02Z,it dosent say that its registered when i use the key! how do i fix this?
,N1ckerz,2008-04-13T22:39Z,"I can confirm that this version of the code does include a trojan that will send all recorded items to the coder without the users knowledge.

Pleaase do not install this version of Keylogger on yours or anyone elses system. Instead, download Ardamax Keylogger 2.9 from the vendors website and use the keygen from this package to genrate the serial needed to unlock the application.

You may also wish to obtain the removal tool at the same time.

Hope this helps."

,mamaloney,2008-04-24T05:51Z,why dosent the keygen work?
,kg1338,2008-04-29T19:24Z,how do i open the keylogger?
,stargazer73,2008-05-02T02:09Z,Why are the Invisibility opptions grayed out? Thank you!
,MasterSkeet,2008-05-03T05:06Z,"wow fucktards... A keylogger is a trojan, thats how it works.  Stop bitching about how ur antivirus actually works."
,SilentTech,2008-05-08T11:41Z,You know it's funny that installing their software off the web causes NO virus actions yet installing your download causes many virus alerts.  The keygen works however with no ill effects.  I doubt this software is ok.  
[T],ony,2008-05-10T12:02Z,"SilentTech: 

# April 5, 2008 - Spanish language added to Ardamax Keylogger. 

# March 26, 2008 - Swedish language added to Ardamax Keylogger.

updates after this release, same version 2.9. new install file, with another filesize and without false/postive code. find the install file from januari and comment when you checked that one out. you'll be surprised that they match. :)"
,solarasc,2008-05-15T07:30Z,"Only worked for 7 days, reset everytime the computer was restarted. after the ""trial period"" expired, keygen no longer worked for me"
,deltantor,2008-06-05T23:16Z,"OH MY GOD WTF THIS FILE HAS A KEYLOGGER IN IT OH GOD WHY DO YOU PUT A KEYLOGGER IN THIS WTF

in short, stop being stupid dumbasses and freaking out when you download a fucking keylogger to find out it has a keylogger. Its like downloading porn and then freaking out because it is porn"
,Teaguesy,2008-07-02T08:50Z,see. this is why i dont use AV. false alarms for my shit.
,Teaguesy,2008-07-02T08:52Z,uhhhmmmm and also note. if this was truly a trojan to harm u do u think the programmer would have made it force seed the torrent? 45 seeds ftw?!
,heofs,2008-07-28T23:19Z,"No virus in this, if the antivirus find something it is becuase it is trying to protect the comp against key loggers.

if u got AVG 8.0 go to resident shield and click ''Manage Exceptions'' then click ''Add Path'' and then open the destination folder =) 

if u had done this right AVG will not block the program =)

,zero0master,2008-08-07T13:11Z,"If you don't find a trojan in this then you might want to think about getting some new anti-spyware\virus... anyways, I found a false positive on my Steam.exe with ZoneAlarm... ZA decided to fuck things up for me by deleting steam.exe, so I had to reinstall it... except for that everything works just fine."
,elleohelle,2008-08-09T16:26Z,"Just a heads up to anyone considering installing a keylogger. Like parents who know how to navigate myspace and use AIM who consider themselves savvy internet users. You'll have problems and blame it on the file. 

A keylogger (and much software) is a little more advanced to properly install on your machine. It IS illegal to put one on a computer you don't own. It IS legal to view keylogger info on a computer you do own. 

I'm afraid the ""curious parent"" with simple internet experience isn't going to figure out how to configure their firewall to accept this program since FWs are *made to deter* these. You have to be at least intermediate and know what you're doing, it will require some changes to your FW and isn't just a simple ""install and run"". A parent who knows email, IM and how to navigate some websites simply isn't going to be able to correctly configure this without READING the FAQ's on the program's site and spending time to properly configure it."

But what use is this program if the person whos trying to install it gets a message ""this will install Ardamas keylogger monitoring tool. do u wish 2 continue?""

STUPID, or does anyone else know how to hide that message when it is installed remotely?

Thanks.

[T],ony,2008-08-19T15:43Z,"JCUSA: There are two versions of it. There is also a ""silent"" version. The ""silent"" version of 2.9, is unfortunately not on their site anymore.

You can fix your problem anyway, it's not rocket science.

Download a hex editor, for example hex workshop. open HTV.003 in the editor, search for the string 6A34 and change it to EB1F. It should be found at offset 57E. This will remove the message."
,Shorty1038,2008-08-24T04:49Z,"I dont mean to sound like a total noob but for some reason whenever i install it i cant get it to run.
like at the end of the installation it has the option to run the keylogger and i clik it but it doesnt show up. ANd when ever i try and run it form program list it says Windows cannot run this specific path.
Help please"
[T],ony,2008-08-24T16:32Z,Shorty1038: sounds like your anti-virus blocks it. add it to you anti-virus exception list. you will see white tray icon when you start it.
