This is a must download for any Stray Cats fans, it's a band called The Tom Cats made up of three people you may be familiar with: Brian Setzer, Texas Slim (Lee Rocker), and Slim Jim Phantom.  Before they were The Stray Cats they were The Tom Cats.  Highlights of the album include "Tom Cat Strut."  There is no track list because this was not listed in the cd database and I didn't want to go through and name each one before I ripped it.  There's a bunch of Eddie Cochran covers, some Gene Vincent, and even some Hank Williams covers.
