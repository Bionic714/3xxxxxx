,Netzach,2008-01-15T13:42Z,"Emn. What VLC is, is a much smaller mystery that what the hell the plug-in does."
,JestaGeek,2008-01-15T15:35Z,"The plug-in, like any other plug-in for media, allows you to view the media within your browser if someone has embedded, e.g. an .avi file, or whatever other supported media, within a web page. It's for Mozilla/Firefox/Safari browsers. And it's freely available to download from the link given by avincent (above), too, though sharing it here could help alleviate the drain on their servers."
,JestaGeek,2008-01-15T15:39Z,"Maybe it would also help to analogize: Other players, e.g. Flash, Quicktime, etc, have stand-alone apps and browser plugins. You can tell your browser to use a particular plugin to deal with certain types of media embedded in a page. This plugin should, in theory, play any media in the page where it is rather than needing to download the file and play it in the standalone VLC app."
,nanoboy,2008-01-18T14:25Z,Thanks JestaGeek for the useful description!  It annoys me when I can't play media on browser and can't find any plug-in.
