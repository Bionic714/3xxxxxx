Plot Line:

While Ben is presenting new information about John Wilkes
Booth and the 18 pages missing from Booth's diary, one
man stands up and presents a missing page of John Wilkes
Booth's diary. Thomas Gates, Ben's great-grandfather, is
mentioned in the page. It shows that Ben's great-grandfather
could have been involved with Abraham Lincoln's murder.
When doing more research, the conspiracy takes Ben, Abigail,
and Riley to Buckingham Palace (which they break into).
It takes them to a book in the White House (which they
break into also) and they even steal a page from the book.
But in order to see more from the book, their choice is
either get elected president or kidnap the President of
the United States. Which do they choose? It's obvious.
The conspiracy then crosses to Mount Rushmore and they
even mention the JFK conspiracy. Can Ben clear his family's
name? Or will his family be linked to the murder of Abraham
Lincoln?
