Strung Out (Old but still great to watch),Flow (Not Bad), Carpe Diem(divx file only), Slingshot Video, and Ten-4 (excellent).I should have the new ACL video catalyst in the next few days, but for now let me know if you want any of these and if the quality on autofocus was alright! Goodwinds - Tr@\/!$Hk@"
