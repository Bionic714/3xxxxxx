,Iranmaster,2011-01-08T15:11Z,"EdiSchwager you are right. BBC is an archive of history, culture, beliefs and any other aspects of all countries around the world. Here in Iran most of the documentaries that you see in IRIB are BBC's productions. BBC also played a big role in our revolution in 1979 to help the islamic regime take power."
