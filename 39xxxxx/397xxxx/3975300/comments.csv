,EzeRoss,2008-01-14T02:17Z,"Fireball XL5 is on Sing to the World STTW3041-11
A set I have just been asking for someone to please download. It would be nice to see a few more uploaders joining in. Don't think I don't appreciate everything that you all do though.
The STTW set is one that I would seriously value as there are a lot of rare tracks on it. Heres hoping that one of our latest friends have at least the disc you are looking for.

,sas666,2008-10-20T20:44Z,for those of you who want to know of good karaoke playing and writing software look for swift elite to play karaoke with twin mixers and cd=g pro to copy back on to disc.hope this helps
,gwod,2008-12-22T11:58Z,I use a programme called Swift ultrlite it is far less cluttered and easy to use than Swift Elite. You just load ALL your songs via the add folder feature and then using the quick search facility type in either the track number the title OR the artist and all or any variations will pop up and reduce the list as you type more. 
,Katonic,2008-12-24T11:45Z,"YAY, many new cover songs we've discussed me doing in our band are in this torrent, so I can record my practice sessions, and when I ""nail"" them I can then give them to my band members so they get my ""style"" down.

EzeRoss, you rock!"
,copstack,2008-12-30T19:36Z,"Thanks for all the post. I just finished this set and they sound great. The only problem with the PI series, in my opinion, is that they add in too much back up singing. PI023 .03 is a good example of this. Almost the whole song is sung by background singers. I prefer a more bare track. I know you have nothing to do with this but I just wanted to rant. "
