It's more than 30 years since Celtic defeated Rangers on six consecutive meetings. That was in the early 1970s under the stewardship of the great Jock Stein.

Now, with Martin O'Neill at the helm, the Celts have done it again. There were no fewer than five Old Firm victories for the Hoops last term.
The 6-game run started with the final clash of season 2002-2003 at Ibrox after Celtic returned exhausted from beating Boavista to do the same to Rangers within 48 hours.

"Green & Whitewash" is an essential 90-minute pleasure trip for all Celtic fans.
