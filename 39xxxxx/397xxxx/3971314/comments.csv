It's the full English version with Spanish menus on the front of the movie, which you can strip off using ""Fab DVD"" before you burn to disk.  Another good Greer Garson (and Ronald Coleman) movie is ""Random Harvest"".  Can anyone suggest any other good old movies for me to download for my elderly parents to watch?"
