,sexy_chonga,2008-01-15T20:29Z,how do i open the files?  they dont look like video format
,stealnwhine,2008-01-15T22:29Z,"sexy_chonga, you're commenting on the wrong torrent.  This one has just two .avi files and an nfo, hence the **UNPACKED** bs.  In other words, this torrent is for 'tards who can't manage the original.  You know, the one you can't open..."
,tom_dalen,2008-01-16T04:26Z,It's a teenagemovie.. not very good either.. bad acting and bad story.

,OleKristoffer,2008-01-16T21:34Z,"tom_dalen, don't criticise this movie please.
Maybe you don't understand the funny things in it, or just doesn't like it. But that doesn't meen others agree with you, so it's no point in telling people here it's a bad movie.

But for the sake of the arguement, it's a GOOD movie. Everyone should see this."
,lacrossefan1,2008-01-17T02:58Z,Thank-you 
,HenstarArtagnan,2008-01-18T04:01Z,"OleKristoffer, have you ever thought about the fact that there might be people agreeing with him. 

And if he wishes to voice his oppinion thats his choice.

,mac_ftw,2008-01-21T02:59Z,"my girlfriend says this movie is a good one. but im to lazy to go see it, so i'll let you guys know :D"
,OleKristoffer,2008-01-21T16:25Z,"HenstarArtagnan, what's the point.

Since he's not a professional critic, there is no point in saying it's good or bad. 

If one say it's good, one say it's bad, what do you decide to belive? it's no point. 
But if it's about the quality or helping people unzipping or fixing the subs, it isn't an opinion thing.

So, same to you dude, ""Think before u speak"""
