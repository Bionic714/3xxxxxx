Kimber┬« was founded with the singular purpose
of building fine sporting firearms, better even
than classics from the golden age of American
gunmaking. Modern manufacturing techniques
would be embraced and used to advantage, but
assembly, fit and finish could only depend on
practiced hands. There would be no compromise in
features, materials or performance.
Rimfire rifles led the way, followed by centerfire
rifles, pistols and finally shotguns. As new models
were introduced more shooters and hunters were
attracted by classic lines, dependability and accuracy.
In turn, demand fueled growth and encouraged
continual product improvement.
Today more than ever, the reputation of the Kimber
brand reflects the original purpose ? and Kimber
is known as America?s leading manufacturer of
premium production firearms.
