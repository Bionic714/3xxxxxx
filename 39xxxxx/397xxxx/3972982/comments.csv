Just garbage!"
[T],Omegarex1969,2008-01-14T10:19Z,"wamperson, I don't see you posting any torrents? Are you just here to complain. I posted to share some iPhone ringtones that I thought were cool and am just waining for feedback that they are working well so I can post 200 more. So if you don't like them that is fine but they are not crap and I do not see you trying to add anything to the community so why not just move on."

[T],Omegarex1969,2008-01-15T06:29Z,"avincent,

I will look into it and get back to you asap."
,avincent,2008-01-18T18:01Z,omega...no need to troubleshoot this...i at least got to listen to the ringtones...and not big on animal noises as ringtones...
