B6 is unknown to me or did you put extras from B5-B&F on seperate DVD(Blackadder - The Cavalier Years + Blackadder - Baldrick's Video Diary)????"
,rhebult,2008-01-16T21:53Z,"and always nice to know: what is the source, what is the region (PAL/NTSC) and especially: are there any subs or other audio streams?"
,spellweaver,2008-01-18T20:34Z,"sorry for delay, yes you're right, and you're also wrong.
There are 4 series, 1-4 christmas carol is disc 5, and back & forth is disc 6.
These are original dvds, nothing added or taken away, sorry nobody could get it, i fluffed it up in trying to torrent, but after reading forum, i now know how to upload, so please be patient, while  i rip all of them to my hdd, and upload them as seperate dvds.
Thank you all for being patient and helping me."
