,timelawd,2010-05-30T01:33Z,"Are the last minutes of the movie really missing?
Please let us know. I do really love this film, but I would be very disappointed if I couldn't watch the great final scene with Clift and Monroe in the pickup truck below the starry sky. (The end of the star system?)
Thanks a lot."
