Wearing Holstein-patterned chaps and mixing kangaroo references with Mariachi music, the Wiggles take on a Western theme in this eccentric hybrid of Australian and American cowboy life. The central plot revolves around the town fair\'s Country Cook-Off and the Wiggles\' favorite chef Alfonso\'s \"disaster pasta,\" a crushing culinary failure due to a missing ingredient. Greg, Anthony, Murray, and Jeff set off to find the all-important component aided by Foodman, Superhero of Sustenance. Along the way there is plenty of opportunity for singing (\"We\'re cowboys, we eat fresh fruit when we can.\"). The highlight is the Spanish language \"Cielito Lindo\" sung--and danced--by a traditional Mariachi band. Despite a distinct lack of horses and cows, children ages 2 to 8 will enjoy the hour-long ride.
