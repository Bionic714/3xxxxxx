I burned this game at 16x and at 4x, both disc freeze up on the intro movie at the part where their escaping and knuckles makes a comment. Wondering if any other part freezes in the game.
I was starting to wonder if it froze cause i used 16x, although i have 10 other backups at 16x without an issue. So its apparently the torrent thats messed up. I have NTSC Wii 3.2u wiikey 1.9(x) Im DL the PAL version to see if that workes any better."

Shame no one has or is willing to share the working proper from Wiifi."
