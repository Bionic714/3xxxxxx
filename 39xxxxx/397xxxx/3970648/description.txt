A decent pdf selection from a CIA chef (culinary Institute of Arts.) volumes 1 through 5. 
I downloaded this from a idiot who liked to password his files for profit. This nor any of my torrents, what few there are will ever be passworded. I beg others to do as I am, and when you run into a passworded file, reissue it like this non passworded. I also have another one 300 recipes for the grill. help yourself and please I do not have a lot of bandwidth so will seed these until a few people get them, but please others continue to seed and enjoy.
