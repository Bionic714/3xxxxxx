,raindr0ps,2008-01-10T19:15Z,"Hey, thanks! Actually, I and a lot of others have already downloaded it from ""the idiot"". Do you have the password? Would really appreciate it."
,raindr0ps,2008-01-10T19:23Z,"That was dumb. It's such a small file that I downloaded it faster than you could leave a comment with the password. Usually I just keep checking back on the torrent in hopes someone else will get the PW and post it. 

Thanks again, friend"

its case sensitive."
,duhprane,2008-01-12T20:12Z,"Well who's the idiot the idiot who passworded it or the idiot who thinks he has re-uploaded it un-passworded but actually DID NOT, or me who believed it was free of its passwording......and the ""Congratulations!Thispromotionisavailableforconsumersin""
password is WRONG so what the fuck...."
,Bamimi,2008-11-16T02:58Z,"uhm actually you'd be the idiot I think, cause this one isnt passworded at all. it's just zipped.

And MDL_NR1: I don;t think I was saying anything was wrong with your upload, sorry if I offended. My general practice is just as I said it ""If you see a person who hasn't ever uploaded anything, except maybe a bunch of files on that specific day or what have you, then it's wise to test it out in a sandbox. The logic behind it being simply, people who upload viri/etc will get their accounts canceled, so what they do of course is just bounce off another IP and recreate another account and upload some more trash all at once. but that only lasts as long as it takes to get the account canceled again.
ie: if you see someone who has uploaded something at least enough time ago for the mods to react to it,, and someone to of reported it, then chances are it's at least a little more trustworthy. It wasn't a you thing specifically.

,Bamimi,2008-11-16T03:01Z,"as far as the above comment btw, ut commentor was pasting a post I put on the other guys upload, for other people who actually downloaded his. that is the pw to his upload, not this one. and it might not even be to his anymore because like I said what people often do is they password protect something, then they switch it as soon as someone posts the password, in a attempt to keep getting them to the site. that password was good at the time I used it.....no promises after. sorry."
