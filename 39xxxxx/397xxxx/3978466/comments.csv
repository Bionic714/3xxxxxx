,Firestorm037,2008-05-10T00:58Z,"It doesn't seem to work for me. The setup loads, but when I select a directory, it says invalid. Please help?"
,skatefarfar,2008-05-29T22:56Z,The copy works fine since i use it myself. and there cant be any virus in this file? ;o my computer is all clean. 
,Cheroku,2008-07-27T19:23Z,"I haven't DLed it yet, but WinRAR opens .iso files. Open a new WinRAR Archive and Click ""Ctrl+S"" go to Integration and check all the folders unless you have something specific other than what's up there. You would know if you did.

,antusss,2008-08-01T04:54Z,"Its the same prob as the original has (vs60wiz on XP). Right click key.dat on the cd, open with regedit to import it to the registry then run acmboot.exe instead of the main setup progam. Working OK for me."
