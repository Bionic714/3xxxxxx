as soon as you start seeding i will do the same!"
,scunky,2008-01-15T14:38Z,"how did you get this?
Amazon say it's not released until 16th"
,quark512,2008-01-15T14:43Z,I take it this is the english version? No localization?
,west1,2008-01-15T14:52Z,Forgot to add that this was posted as Home & Student edition.
,west1,2008-01-15T14:56Z,Home & Student wont allow connections to Exchange servers.
,5continents,2008-01-15T15:01Z,"Thanks!  I'm already seeding.  As quark512 asked, is this English only or multiple languages?  M$ Office 2004 for Mac was not multi languages."
,west1,2008-01-15T15:08Z,"Looks like English only, there are proofing tools for other languages included. M$ site lists other languages."
,Shiven10,2008-01-15T15:11Z,"Thanks for this! been waiting for a couple of hours for this to appear (not entirely sure of time differences cause i live in australia).

@scunky: http://www.macoffice2008.com/ the official site says 15th ^^"
,tuxedosthlm,2008-01-15T16:10Z,keep getting an error message when downloading the torrent. looks like it might have something to do with the $ spelling`? 
,west1,2008-01-15T16:14Z,Not sure why people are having problems with the torrent. There are 300+ peers connected to me at the moment with a total of 494 peers showing so I assume it's working.
,sivertab,2008-01-15T16:24Z,"I got the same problem as maheshgarnara. Error 503 service unavailable. I also try to save the torrent file, and it does'nt exist. "
,Mac_PPC,2008-01-15T16:35Z,The torrent itself is probably fine.  It's TPB that's fucked.  The links to the torrents are spitting back errors.

,tikitak,2008-01-15T17:49Z,"West1: Can you confirm the source of this image? There was another image floating around another torrent tracker yesterday, but there is a discussion going on about how it may be fake (I've just re continued my download to inspect for myself)"
,west1,2008-01-15T17:54Z,"This was posted on rapidshare, I along with many others have installed and have it working. Please note that it is the student/teacher edition so no exchange server access in entourage.

It will only work on 1 Mac at a time unlike the Home version which should work on 3.

It is not the late stage beta that was posted on an Italian forum and doesn't contain the ppc.txt file that the 'fake' version installed.

Check MSJUK or MacBB for details."
,rbsfou,2008-01-15T18:39Z,Only 39% available 3hrs 17minutes after initial seeding? Also there's nearly 1500 peers but my client is only connectiong to about 70 :(
,gialandra,2008-01-15T18:58Z,In what way can I be a seed? Must I have the whole file?
,west1,2008-01-15T19:03Z,"Not sure why the tracker is only showing 3 Leechers, there are 700+ connected and a total of 1500 in the swarm. Someone did get 100% but did a runner before seeding.

I will leave it open and seeding but speed isn't that fast."
,wvy,2008-01-15T19:15Z,"I hope there will be a dutch version soon?

,rob010,2008-01-15T23:58Z,"Enjoy the Late beta fake guys. This is a rather badly hacked version.

The original dmg is 2 gig what is a good sign that it is not real.

It is also currently being tracked by the likes of Media Sentry and others.

The real retail deal will be available soon.

,RDaneel2,2008-01-16T00:10Z,Thanks for this great post. Downloading now and will seed @ max bw during night.

Please post the MD5 of this nice upload of yours.
so we could verify it after we finished downloading it.

thanks!"
,jocamero,2008-01-16T02:04Z,Anyone know if this is a fake or the final version?  Odd that the file size is 522 MB yet doesn't the retail copy ship on a DVD?
,blowmegud,2008-01-16T02:04Z,"west1:

...and one more thing.

is the file in your website and the one on this torrent are the same?"

,antamony,2008-01-16T02:58Z,"Only observation here, is that this is the first time I've seen 7000 plus leechers on a mac app.

,masterbluestar,2008-01-16T02:59Z,"Just from what I could find on Microsoft's site:""Mac Office 2008 has been released to manufacturing December 12-2007. The product launch is January 15 at MacWorld.

,hockynut23,2008-01-16T05:15Z,Stuck at 75% plz seed!!!!
,hockynut23,2008-01-16T05:16Z,started downloading from http://soft.macx.cn/indexen.asp and it is only going at about 10k/s
,Siouxsie871,2008-01-16T05:20Z,"Take it easy people, everyne is stuck at (for the moment) 75%.

There are four seeders, but all the 8000 people downlading the torrent are obviously causing the slow progress. As some people get bits and pieces of the seeders files - it will trickle down the line to all of us. But since the seeder/leecher ratio is 0.05% I don't expect this to be done for a few hours. When people start reaching 95%-100% the overall speed will increase drastically. Torrents behave like this when too heavily bombarded."
,Siouxsie871,2008-01-16T05:21Z,"Yeah, I also got ~15 KB/s from the chinese site. So I stuck with the torrent. I don't feel like waiting 24 hours from the torrent upload to the install of Office is unbearable. I still prefer this to buying it, or waiting a month until it gets upped.

Stop complaining and wait."
,hockynut23,2008-01-16T05:24Z,Sorry - not complaining.  I just read the other posts and realized it was just released today.  Thanks for the upload.
,Mikaka,2008-01-16T06:55Z,only in English or is there others langages ?
,ross.32,2008-01-16T07:29Z,"So what version of Office is this? Standard, Student, or Media?"
,hockpooh,2008-01-16T07:31Z,My download is stalled at 82.4% but I'm still uploading. This is painful. I've been downloading since noon and it's 1:30 AM.
,SKPnSF,2008-01-16T07:47Z,Come on you slackers !! Please keep seeding even after your DL completes so others can get the whole file.
,EchoRob,2008-01-16T07:50Z, brokenstones.cn  u can download this from there at super duper fast speeds. ThePirateBay is a crap torrent site

,dechamp,2008-01-16T08:23Z,"What a bunch of whiners. Who gives a shit if a torrent takes a day or two to download? Get this file as you can, or wait for much better full versions as they come along.

True. Don't get angry because you can't steal this fast enough."
,uniquestar,2008-01-16T08:43Z,"ffs people, 9000 leechers and 6 seeders, all you s**theads out there who are complaining about no seeders, and then you yourself aren't seeding.

no-one's gonna get this done unless some people actually start seeding.  12 hours of seeding will not cost you anywhere near as much as if you had to pay for this."

,dann345,2008-01-16T09:25Z,"Honestly people... earlier today when I started downloading there were 6 seeders and 7K leechers. 
All of us wants this, and obviously the number of leechers would grow, but whoever has this could be a bit more considerate and seed aswell. I can't believe there are ONLY 4 seeders for this file. 
Most of us is stuck at 80 sumething %...
