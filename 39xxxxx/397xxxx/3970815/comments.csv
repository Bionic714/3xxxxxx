Some people are stupid, you clown. I'm not"
,mhku,2008-05-16T12:51Z,"It may not contain a worm but the installer writes to your registry with a Microsoft Updates entry and points to svehost.exe that IS a worm.

 I'm not sure if it tries to install svehost.exe as spybot caught it during installation and blocked it."

,Rathann,2010-03-10T01:49Z,to all of you uninformed people out there any keygen in a windows os will be recognized as a virus this torrent is fine stop bictching and seed 
,Jiia,2011-08-15T22:17Z,"This torrent has an actual virus. I know that most of the keygens use injections to get the key but this program installs ""svehost.exe"" in your windows directory which is a backdoor trojan. They KeyMaker is also a .jar file (java program) so most people won't know how to use them."
