From Wiki:
Hack/Slash is a series of comic books published by Devil's Due Productions that has also been adapted into a stage play and as feature film. The series, starting as a series of one-shots, was created by writer and sometime penciller Tim Seeley. The focus of the series is on a horror victim, Cassie, who strikes back at the monsters, known as "slashers", with Vlad, a freakish man who frequently wears a gas mask.



I've taken the liberty of numbering the one-shots by publication date.

I apologize in advance for my crappy upload speed.

As always, thanks to the original scanners :)
