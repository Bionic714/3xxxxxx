here's a thought for you people and everyone else. when you find a bad file, passworded without saying the password in the description, or viruses/fake/etc, then look down your screen for the button called 'forum' click it, and report the bad torrent in the forums so administration can remove it. no need for you to call them a fag, a idiot or anything else. if the FIRST person who sees it gets it removed before anyone else sees it, then these people are no longer effective.
   Also post in comments if its bad, what the passwords are for them, etc. and if someone else says its bad and it isnt, report that as well in comments and on the forum."
