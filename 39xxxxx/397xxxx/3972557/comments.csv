,k.a.r.l.andersson,2008-01-13T16:25Z,cmtip> vad har du för chip..?
,Josh4721,2008-01-13T22:57Z,thanks mack. 
,mrspock09,2008-01-14T01:58Z,"thanks mack1985 the emulator works flawlessly so far, can't wait for another of your releases!"
,sb18180,2008-01-14T03:22Z,"thanx for the up.is the emulator in the dvd?

thanx"

,k.a.r.l.andersson,2008-01-15T09:48Z,"cmtip> jag skulle nog rekommendera att chippa det med ett modbo eller matrix chip. Min erfarenhet av swap disks och minneskortslösningar är tyvärr ingen höjdare. Finns att köpa på 24.se om du kan löda, annars brukar det finnas någon firma som kan fixa det i närmaste stad.

Mack1986> Work's fine! Great upload! I played Donkey Kong but it felt like the grafics should have been better, or was it that ""bad""? Is it high resolution (original res.) on every game or are some down sampled? I had to try the game ""Zombies ate my neighbours"", must be one of the best SNES titles..(?).."
,k.a.r.l.andersson,2008-01-15T11:06Z,BTW do someone know if there's some Amiga station or C64 station avalible for PS2..?
,P´Da,2008-01-15T13:15Z,SNÄLLA HJÄLP!!!!  Är de någon som vet ett prog som funkar för bränning på PS2  spel använder Alcohol 120% ibland funkar de. Men på God of war II säger den att de Inet finns tillräckligt med plats och spelet blir 7.70 gib istället  som de ska vara 3.39 gib.  Snälla någon..
,k.a.r.l.andersson,2008-01-15T17:59Z,"P?Da> 3,39 gib, är det zip/rar-filens storlek? Kan hända att den blir större när du packar upp den. Jag hittade en GoW, den var runt 3 opackad o drygt 4 gib uppackad. Nero funkar för mig, osäker på vilken version av Nero jag har, men testa den senaste och Fulla versionen. Borde funka (starta en annan torrent annars och prova igen). Lycka till!"
,crack_22222,2008-01-16T03:26Z,this as a great find now we just the same thing for nes

,mrspock09,2008-01-18T22:01Z,"hey if you upload a sega genesis emulator for the ps2, can you include the shining force series? those games were really great and i'd love to be able to play them again w/o having to play them on the computer all the time"
,in5ult080t,2008-01-19T03:51Z,This is great! Thanks. Um...How do I seed? XD
,mancebo,2008-01-20T20:25Z,NTSC or PAL?
,faanvet,2008-01-21T22:27Z,"Någon som vet om det funkar med HD-loader ?
Anyone know if it works with HD-loader ?"
,gong,2008-01-26T00:57Z,mack1985 är detta en ny relales från snes station .. ? pga av att utväcklaren la ju ne sitt jobb redan 2003 . Därför undrar ja om de är en ny utgåva ? 
,moosebilly,2008-01-26T18:45Z,"mack, Sega em. runs and plays great, but i get the black screen w/ this one I burnt w/ nero any advice?"

,polymatt,2008-02-01T15:56Z,this did not work for me either i also got the black screen. this is after putting it direct to the hdd
,jordanfitz9,2008-02-01T17:08Z,will it work with cog swap
,WillyWonkaDoopidyDo,2008-02-05T01:09Z,"Another great emulator.  Works well with swap magic, but I was having problems with some of the kirby games"
,CFCFTW,2008-02-09T16:46Z,Does it work on CDR ? Anyone tested?
,Westenfeldt,2008-02-15T19:38Z,I will download and burn it to a CD-R to see if it works.
,Westenfeldt,2008-02-17T18:30Z,"Yes.. I found out :p . 
"
,Skuggarn,2008-02-24T13:46Z,"Nån som känner till nån liknande torrent fast med Nintendo 64?

Anybody knows if there is any torrent with emulator + games from n64?"
,Skuggarn,2008-02-24T13:48Z,And Thanks alot mack1985! This is awesome.
,CFCFTW,2008-02-29T14:53Z,"Works great, thanks for the upload, really nice to play these old games :D"
,cobert,2008-03-11T13:33Z,Can you save your game progress or do you have to have hard drive..
,cobert,2008-03-12T01:05Z,Wow this is very nice. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't work on CDR because it's an image file and it would be too big for cdr. You can save your progress onto a ps2 memory card. Great torrent. I'll continue to seed.
,narutomaaan,2008-03-28T00:52Z,kan du spela detta på ps3? för på ps3 kan man ju spela ps2 spel eller måste jag vänta till dom gör en version till ps3?
,narutomaaan,2008-03-28T00:54Z,can u play this on ps3? cause u can play ps2 games on ps3 or do i have to wait until it comes a version for ps3??
,tommyknocker,2008-04-25T16:41Z,Is it NTSC or PAL?
,True_astoroth,2008-06-06T19:51Z,"Downloaded and tested, load with swap magic, Keylauncher or a mod chip. NTSC format, all games load fine, though a few have slight lag issues.  Not a serious problem, but for example, Super Metroid has double sound (you shoot and you here 2 shots) stuff like that, and their is a bit of visual lag.  over all great torrent, thanks mack!   Super Mario RPG how ever doesn't have any fight scenes (cuts to black screen just before and then the whole fight is blacked out) and has major lock up issues as I just seen when my friend was testing out games."
,True_astoroth,2008-06-06T20:07Z,"sorry for double post but I burned with Alcohol 120% @ 6x speed and onto a DVD, as this won't fit on a normal CD, and a majority of the games seem to have a lot of lag."
,cn96,2008-08-01T19:28Z,ist there a guide on how to get it ready for use without a modchip?
,saphrine,2008-09-07T05:13Z,Is Zelda on it?

,jlock003,2008-12-08T00:24Z,"Hi guys, thanks for the download mack1985.  Quick question, what do I need to unrar in order to get an iso file?  or is there not an iso file with this download?  I'm still a newbe to this thing so I'm sure I'm just doing something wrong, but I unzip the initial folder with 7 zip and then unrar the rar file with 7 zip and I don't get an iso.  What am I doing wrong?  Thanks for your suggestions, and again for the download."

,mervynsow,2011-07-22T00:55Z,"not an iso file. is an image file though. those with free Mcboot can convert it to an iso then patch with ESR. thats what i done. works for me. Thanks 4 this, i'v been running the elf file from a flash drive with ulauncher for a while and it would crash when trying to save a game state or when exiting the main menu. "
