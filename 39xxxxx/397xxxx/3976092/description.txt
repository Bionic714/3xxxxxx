From the creators  of TEN4 and Metropolis comes ACL ProductionsÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â¢Ã?Â¯Ã?Â¿Ã?Â½Ã?Â¯Ã?Â¿Ã?Â½ latest installment in progressive kiteboarding videos.  This highly anticipated release, AutoFocus, documents what happens when you combine wind, raw talent and the most exclusive kiteboarding destinations in the world.  AutoFocus brings together seven of the most talented, style driven and highly respected wakestyle riders in the industry and drops them into the largest most elaborate conglomeration of sliders, kickers and rails to date.  

The ACL crew documented and captured epic images of these riders pushing themselves to new levels, and ultimately, progressing the sport of kiteboarding to a legitimizing new level.  AutoFocus was shot on location in Antigua, Dominican Republic,  Coche Island Venezuela and features the riding of Andre Phillip, Mauricio Abreu, Bertrand Fleury, Moe Goold, Jason Slezak, Jason Stone, and Stav Niarchos.   
Also featured is tons of bonus footage including the making of AutoFocus, how to build sliders, rider interviews, out-takes, still photos, behind the scenes with the riders, insane wipeouts and much more!  Enjoy the progression.
