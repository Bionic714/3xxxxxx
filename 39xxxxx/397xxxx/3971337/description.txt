1. Install NOD32 2.x. Check "Set update parameters later" to get past
   the password screen during the commercial installation.
 
   !DO NOT RESTART AFTER INSTALLING!

2. Install NOD32 FiX.

3. Now restart your computer.

4. Enjoy! ;)

Note: If you already have NOD32 fully installed just skip Step #1. 
But, you'll still need to reboot after applying the FiX 
to ensure the events get properly placed in the NOD32 Scheduler.

This basicly makes that 30 day trial for NOD32 last...oh...40,000 YEARS! 
It also changes the default update server to that of the eval signatures 
so you no longer need a password to update NOD32.
