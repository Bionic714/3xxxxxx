,eygoalston,2008-06-23T17:39Z,"VLC player isn't working for me :[

I downloaded version 0.8.6h, but it never plays the videos. Could anyone help out"
,Sicklike,2008-06-25T23:03Z,the VLC player is working great.  CD 10 is just a repeat of the same line over and over again. 
,Mario8672,2008-08-06T20:57Z,How do you get this on an iPod?
,RedLeader0083,2008-09-08T21:23Z,"R you sure this is all complete?
After disk 3 is only 22 minutes long James Matador PUA goes to say something about America and then the video stops.

Disk 4 he's talking about something else.

I think some files must be missing or something- my download was completed though "
,Sicklike,2008-09-16T09:07Z,does cd 10 work on this one?
