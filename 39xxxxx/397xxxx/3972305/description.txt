Michael & Levan - Distant Closeness (Original Mix 2007) [Progressive House]


My previous release has got us nicely in the mood for a bit of new and very well crafted progressive.  And if you took my advice and rolled up a fat spliff, you'll certainly be needing this little treat to appease the vibe further...

20.6MB

320KBps Digital Release.


For those of us in the know, it's a bit Moshic & Omb and it's also a bit Space Manoeuvres.  This is pure quality spacey and atmospheric rolling progressive.


The entire release contains 4 remixes, all of which are splendid variations of the Original, but since Michael & Levan might be new to many of us, I thought it best to feature just their original work at this stage in the schedule.  And in all honesty, it is the Original that I have been paying the most attention to and enjoying tremendously.
