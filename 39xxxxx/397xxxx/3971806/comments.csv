This is NOT HD/720p.  436 x 720 resolution = widescreen DVD format.

I'm holding out for the HD version.."

[T],moviesbyrizzo,2011-11-28T17:33Z,"If youre looking for SUPREME picture quality with great sound too here is a bluray 1080p converted to standard divx picture size 720 X 404 - could just as easily make it an xvid for you if you insist

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6469544/The_Sound_of_Music_(1965)_2GB_DivX_from_1080p_(moviesbyrizzo)

it is 2hrs 54 minutes though rather than 2hrs 47 minutes s subtitles may be the only issue for you to consider

its just not the same if you get it form a dvd (especially dvd5) rather than bluray - even if you convert to dvd sized picture as we have for you as indicated"
