Red Ocean combines  innovative  shooter  gameplay
with unique  underwater  elements.  Players  take
on the role of  diving  instructor  and  treasure
hunter Jack Hard,  who  stumbles  upon  a  secret
Russian   cold   war   research   station    deep
underneath the ocean surface.  As  he  discovers,
it is controlled  by  a  terrorist  organization
and before he knows it, he gets caught  in  their
nefarious  schemes.  The  unique  twist:  players
will  deal  with  water  in  all  3   states   of
aggregation: in liquid form it not  only  enables
you to approach enemies unnoticed by  diving  but
can also conveniently drown a baddie. At sub-zero
temperatures it  quickly  becomes  a  dangerously
slippery surface and  hot  steam  is  nothing  to
mess with either  whether  above  or  below  the
water line,  Red  Ocean  is  sure  to  take  your
breath away.
