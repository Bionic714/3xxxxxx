,GAVB,2008-01-13T18:18Z,"thank u, nice to see some one shots i hate loops cheers"
,artytorrent,2008-01-14T02:57Z,"No worries. Are you looking for oneshots of instruments (e.g. synths/bass/acoustic instruments) or drum/perc sounds in particular? I have tons of both. I shall upload some big packs of oneshots at some point, but I'm busy seeding my current set of torrents at the moment. I thought most people want loops..."
,GAVB,2008-01-14T16:05Z,"i wil help u seed, yes i dont mind loops like 4 kick drums in a row, i just dont like loops that already have the hi hats and fx added, but beggers cant be choosers thanx"
,GAVB,2008-01-14T16:55Z,do u have any vengeance samples like fx vol.2 ?
,artytorrent,2008-01-15T01:07Z,"I've got almost every Vengeance sample CD, but not FX2 yet. I have volume 1, but I didn't think there was much demand for FX samples. I have thousands that I never use, as I tend to make my own, but I'll see if I can get hold of FX volume 2 and upload it in a few days."
,GAVB,2008-01-15T21:37Z,http://djdarbo.co.uk/forums/index.php?showtopic=2420&st=0#entry17895 ive posted loads of samples there so register and get yaself some new samples for free
,drax12,2008-01-18T17:03Z,"Right GAVB.  I've searched everywhere for a tight, thumping Dance Kick.  Some hi-hats that open and close would be nice too.  One-shots.  Cheers all.  P.S Vote Kucinich!!!"
,artytorrent,2008-01-19T21:12Z,Pack 13 has some solid kick drums and hi-hats: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3983265
,drax12,2008-01-22T13:26Z,"Thank you very much.  If you're taking requests I'd love some nki's for kontakt e.g Bass,Cellos and Violins.  I've got a slow dial-up connection so the  2gig libraries are just out of the question.  Cheers."
,artytorrent,2008-01-23T03:32Z,"@drax12: It's too fiddly to create many Kontakt instruments, but I've uploaded some tasty strings for you at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3991499
Hope you can make use of them."
