----------------

Dont worry!
As tom_dalen already said; the quality is very good!

From my point of view; 
Picture 9
Sound 9

The sub-size is a little big. If the font size is 22 (just a guess) it should be 16 or 18. But thats just a small problem.

Absolutely worth downloading!!"
,IgorJ83,2008-04-14T08:52Z,The subtitle is ripped directly on the picture. Is it possible to remove it? Pic quality is OK!!
