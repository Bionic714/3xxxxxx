Overview:	This intriguing effort has more than a touch of both westerns and detective films in the martial arts mix. It could even be called an "Eastern Mystery" movie. It, of course, lives up to its title, as a noble guard is both attacked by bandits as well as betrayed by a relative. Then it's nephew against uncle, daughter against father, concubine against hero, and the law vs. vigilante justice before the last plot is exposed and the lovers are able to ride off into the sunset...
