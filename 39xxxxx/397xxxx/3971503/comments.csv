,adrian311,2008-01-11T05:57Z,"What ever you do , dont put your email address here , the bloody spammers will get you."
,mistertpitydafoo,2008-01-11T15:47Z,"Anyone who wants to talk Kung Fu and Shaw Films or interested in trading through internet or swapping copies through mail, email me at napper36960@mypacks.net

Spammers, it's one of my 5 anonymous emails so all I am looking for is people who contact me from here, and I add their emails to my real email address and send them my real email. So emailing me is pointless because the account is anonymous so I can close it anytime I want and get another anonymous email addy. Just letting you know you are wasting your time, no sales will result from emailing me.

Lets talk and trade!!!
