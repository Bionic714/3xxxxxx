,the_nakaii,2008-03-13T02:30Z,Azureus sux big time. After v 2.5 they fuck it up when they went to VUZE 3.0 Either use Azureus 2.5( a really big resource hog) or go to uTorrent or the original Bittorrent. The rest suck!!

,theantivirus,2008-04-13T18:40Z,"Took a sample for test

PSW Trojan in CS3 gen

Another Fucking loser who quotes that there are no viruses trojans in his download etc etc etc etc

- get a life asshole!"
,theantivirus,2008-04-14T02:38Z,"further sampling of files taken

adobe 8 pro key
winzip pro key

contain rootkits i.e. hidden trojans
(inc adware TSV.generic)

some virus programs cannot detect these but instead will determine that they are malicous due to the nature of the source code and cycle off (very slow download) persistence to download could result in infection with some inferior virus/trojan programs.

can be nasty if allowed to propogate unoticed

suggest that inexperienced / average persons stay well away from these files! Only specialists should download (looking for infected source code)

considering the nature of the files:
1. This guy is a commercial test I.D. for trojans
2. An I.D. theft user
3. Just a serious fucking loser!
4. A hack wannabe?

I dont have time to trace and track this guy - but if anyone else interested - post his I.P. here

He could be sent some source code goodies hinmself
(he like everyone else has to read headers in packets at least)

Definately a LOSER at least"
,joboma,2008-04-17T02:02Z,"Take care, NIS2007 crack is infected with trojan horse..."

,RielRylan,2008-05-24T00:20Z,"I'm VERY new to doing things through BitTorrent/ PirateBay but it looks like everything went VERY smoothly with the Flash CS3 KeyGens i downloaded from you!  

I'm NOT full of sh** either, but I ONLY downloaded the (2) files for the FLASH CS3 Keygen... The 1st one of the two worked fine! And I have AVG and it didn't pick up any worms or Trojans! *fwew*  THanks so much Friendsxix, i've been dying to animate again! 

Feel free to email me if anyone needs help with the Flash key gen stuff!  XD"
,RielRylan,2008-05-24T00:23Z,"---to clarify my post... 

I'm not saying any of the OTHER files aren't ""infected""... as I only took the 2 i needed 

:D wish I knew how to seed!
Good luck all!"
,sepantman,2008-05-25T13:42Z,Seed! thx!
,Friendsxix,2008-07-06T21:58Z,"*Sigh* I didn't put in any virus, nore know how to do so. I just took others work and put it in a pack. So I will just say that I won't seed. (I can't control if others seed)"
,Odinswolf1,2008-08-29T01:31Z,"razorsnakebite  download avg pro 7.5 and insert this serial number 75VNU-TH1RR1-L7-P03-C01-S3S9MD-2YN3AUS

TRUST ME IT WORKS!!"
,grukmuck,2008-10-19T00:46Z,"RielRylan, i did the same thing you did, and the second flash cs3 keygen was reported as a trojan by my avast. 

the serial generated by the keygen worked, but for some reason it wont let me activate it, so i cant use it.  is there anyway to bypass this activation so that i can use flash cs3? if anyone can give me some advice on how to proceed, please let me know."
,TechWizard86,2008-10-20T04:50Z,"shakes head....

let me seperate the idiots from the smart ones...

ANY anti virus program will typically detect keygens as viruses because of the random code they generate you fucktards..stop accusing this man for something he did not do wrong..its your fucking antivirus program behaviors dumbfucks..."
,TechWizard86,2008-10-20T04:56Z,friendsxix do not worry about these fuckers..they are saying shit and they dont even fucking know what they are talking about
,TechWizard86,2008-10-20T04:56Z,get a life theantivirus and stop accusing people when you have no idea what the fuck you are talking about

,Dark_Sage,2009-06-18T07:58Z,do you have a key code for AVG?
,PhlanMic,2010-10-24T14:00Z,@ the FUCK UPS out there now I'm not a IT Geek or any thing like that hell I still use XP for dummies for fuck sake but even I know that KEY GENS register on Anti Virus as Trogens & by the way I've only got 3 years Exp. on computers & I also know that to use a key gen you need to close down The resident shield component on an Anti Virus before opening a key gen & you call yourselves Experts HA HA HA but I'm known for thinking out of the square.
