The Authority is a superhero comic book published by DC Comics under the Wildstorm imprint. It was created by Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch, and follows the adventures of the Authority, a superhero team mainly composed of Ellis-created characters taken from Stormwatch - a title Ellis had previously written.

It is notable for its intense graphic violence, grand scale and visual flair, often described as "widescreen" comics, and the uncompromising attitudes of its characters.
