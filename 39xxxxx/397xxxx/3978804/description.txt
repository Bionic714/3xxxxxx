The second album by the influential Manchester four-piece, it suffered greatly at the time from the sheer weight of expectation generated by both the 5┬╜ year gap between it and the band's eponymous debut and the band's withdrawal from the live arena for 4┬╜ of those years.

Second Coming features tribal rhythms, 1970s-style extended guitar riffs, funky rock/blues numbers with jazz elements and campfire style songs such as "Your Star Will Shine" and "Tightrope" that hint at the bands rural surroundings at the time (the band moved to Wales to make the album). As the line-up began to crumble, three singles ("Love Spreads", "Ten Storey Love Song", and "Begging You") from the album were released in the UK
