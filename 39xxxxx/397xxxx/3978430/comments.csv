,Cubric,2008-01-16T11:41Z,Does this work on an Intel C2D?
,leeroybadboy,2008-01-16T12:57Z,"This comment was lifted from the old demoniod tracker and seems to suggest it wil.

""This game works absolutely perfectly.
Just extract the contents out of the ZIP File & the game is there ready to play.
I have an Intel MacBook & it runs smoothly enough on it (even though it sayd you NEED a G4 or G5 processor) !!
At least 1GB RAM is recommended, though...
Thanks"""

RCT3 Requirements
Operating System: Mac OS X 10.3.9
CPU Processor: PowerPC G4/G5
CPU Speed: 1GHz (1.2GHz recommended)
Memory: 256 MB or higher (512 MB recommended)
Hard Disk Space: 2.0 GB free disk space
Video Card (ATI): Radeon 9000
Video Card (NVidia): GeForce FX5200
Video Memory (VRam): 32 MB or higher
Media Required: DVD Drive
http://www.aspyr.com/product/game_specs/9

Current MacBook Pro Specs (the basic MBP at that)
2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
2GB (two SO-DIMMs) 667MHz DDR2 memory (PC2-5300)
NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT with 256MB of GDDR3 memory and dual-link DVI
http://support.apple.com/specs/macbookpro/MacBook_Pro_Early_2008.html

The MacBook Pro is more than capable of running just about whatever one would like it to run. If a person wanted to, the MBP can have a 2.5GHz C2D, 4 Gigs of RAM, and a 512 MB vid card. The problem that MBP users are having with this game is that it is for POWER PC processors. That problem would exists in a Mac Pro as well (seeing as they run Intel Xeon Processors). There are patches to help, but if a person want this game to run well they need to have an old Mac or get an Intel (or universal) version of the game. 
Next time when you feel like insulting people and talking out of your asshole, perhaps you should check the facts. jerkass."
,Dccphotography,2008-04-16T03:23Z,"Wow that guy really does need to educate himself. I have a 17 inch MBP. 512mb graphics. 2 gigs of ram; not even 4... though soon to upgrade. 

If i can run... Final cut pro, aperture, itunes, ichat, mail, and safari... all at the same time. Im pretty sure it should be fine running a game thats a few years old. That being said. Not DLing this torrent... Its PPC. Dont be stupid. "
