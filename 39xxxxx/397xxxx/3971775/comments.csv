,edinburghei,2008-01-11T18:39Z,"Here is the original torrent http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3971316/Nod_32_3.0.621.0_finally_cracked

This torrent is just the fix taken off the original torrent, you will need the new nod installer too, if you have not the latest update."
,edinburghei,2008-01-11T18:58Z,"Also note this crack was not suitable for 64, as per the original torrent, thius uploader has changed it to say it does, which is not true."

,h8isgr8,2008-01-12T18:22Z,"This still works fine. I suggest disabling the ""threatsense"" feature when installing. It is only used to send user data back to Eset."
,h8isgr8,2008-01-12T18:46Z,"Oops, I mean the ""ThreatSense.Net"" feature."

I need some help please! I have installed Smart Security 3.0 + Fix 1.1. But after restarting I can't update manually. It says : update of the virus signature database not necessary. But the date of real virus database is 20071221. How can I update?"
