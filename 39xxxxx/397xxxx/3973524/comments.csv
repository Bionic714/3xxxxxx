,sexduarf,2008-02-09T18:19Z,"Ginga ninja  i,ve just downloaded ""into the wild kvcd ""  by ginganinja but its not on your list and nero is having problems reading it  - is it yours or is it a fake ?
everything else of yours have gone 2 disc with no probs so im presuming someones put your name  on it !
Cheers 4 the kvcd uploads !!"
,ginga ninja,2008-02-21T11:42Z,"sorry sexduarf it is one of mine !! theres a problem with it ... and here's the fix .........

what you need to do is open the cue file in notepad ... It'll look like this -- 
FILE ""Into The Wild(2007) DVDrip KvCD GingaNinja (TUS Release).bin"" BINARY
TRACK 01 MODE2/2352
INDEX 01 00:00:00
TRACK 02 MODE2/2352
INDEX 00 00:04:00
INDEX 01 00:06:00 

so you want to add the word FLAiTE after (2007) so it looks like this ---

FILE ""Into The Wild(2007) FLAiTE DVDrip KvCD GingaNinja (TUS Release).bin"" BINARY
TRACK 01 MODE2/2352
INDEX 01 00:00:00
TRACK 02 MODE2/2352
INDEX 00 00:04:00
INDEX 01 00:06:00

now save and there you have it !!! it should burn with NERO !!!

I'm sorry about this problem !!!! really don't know how it happened !!!

sorry it took me so long to get back to you but i don't post on tpb anymore !!! 

remember this fix IS'NT for this torrent it's for into the wild .... which you'll find tus-kvcd-group.com"
