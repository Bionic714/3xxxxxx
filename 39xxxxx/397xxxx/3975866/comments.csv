,grizling,2008-03-24T00:36Z,"The audience is in high spirit though, but this concertvideo is an example of how an audience can completely destroy a concert. 
Too much sing along, too much noise is destroying the music."
,thomsonr,2008-04-30T02:30Z,I have almost no volume on Disk one which I downloaded to replace a damaged orginal.  There seems to be volume in the menus.
,LadyCuddles,2008-09-19T20:22Z,"Not sure about this, but, I am listening to the ""audio"" rip of this concert, and am on the d/l for this DVD torrent atm.

Listening to the audio only, it ""sounds"" like the mics are either too close to the audience, or the mics are wrong for the concert, or, lastly, they group is not close enough to the mics. After I get a chance to see the ""visual"" of the concert, I might be able to confirm, one, or all, of the above suspicions. In either case, I agree with the comment about the audience participation, it does distract from ""Rush"" 's performance.

To be completely honest, it sounds like an excellent concert, but, what do you go to a concert for? Gettin' high? Gettin' buzzed? Seeing and hearing a ""live"" performance of your artist or group? Or, are you going to the concert just to hang out with 10,000 other people and the fact that the ""band"" is performing is just ""background"" ?

Oh well... Never seen Rush in concert... Hope to get this completed soon... I really LOVE the band :)

,bertman5050,2009-07-04T01:51Z,to everyone who is mentioning the audience overpowering...this cannot be the DVD rip then. I have seen the actual DVD and Rush is LOUD AND CLEAR. Not sure what could have happened to this torrent to have the audience overpower the band

,pooket,2011-03-09T02:16Z,"Disc B is a waste of bandwidth.  The sound on disc A isn't horrible, but it's not really acceptable either.  It sounds like a bootleg.  The energy and the performance are great, but Geddy's vocals get lost in a wall of sound.  It's a shame they didn't have time to do a sound check that day. (What the fuck is up with that!?!)  I think it's very interesting that Rush put out another concert video only 2 years later called ""R30"".  Why?  Did they feel guilty for such a bad sounding mix?  Did they want to make things right with the people that paid for ""Rush in Rio""?  Did they want a better sounding legacy for people to watch in the future after the band becomes a distant memory?

The following quotes come from a review on allmusic.com:
""There was no soundcheck that night due to production delays in the arena. This is the sound of a band going for it in spite of everything and on the wing -- and the sound, very live, very real, extremely dynamic -- and not only do they pull it off; they issue their best live outing ever."" "
