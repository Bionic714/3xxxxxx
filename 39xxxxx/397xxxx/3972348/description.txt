Episode 4 The Mist Of Silence

Seaview is sent on a political recon mission to an unstable South American country, where a dictatorial General has drugged the president and taken over. Freedom fighters have sprung up to control the take over. When the South American nation's president is over due for mid ocean meeting, Crane and several crewmen board the President's yacht, floating empty in mid-sea. They enter a mist where they are drugged into unconsciousness. Waking up in a South American prison, the men are taken out to the courtyard, one per hour, and executed. All will die unless Crane breaks his oath and confesses what to the details of the Seaview and his mission. Nelson manages to effect a rescue with the assistance of the freedom fighters.
