,wontpayforit,2008-08-18T17:27Z,"Do me a favour, anyone who has the album from 2002.

Who did ""Blow My Mind""?

It sounds like a serious cover of something from Keiko and Komuro of the Japanese superband ""Globe"".

Bloody marvelous sound.
My sister will think I've gone nuts if I call her to buy this for me :D"
,VicVega,2008-11-12T09:11Z,"The ""Robyn is here"" album is the US version from 1997, not the Swedish 1995/1996? version. ""Where Did Our Love Go"" was replaced by ""Show Me Love"", and there are other differences, I guess they remixed some of it since some songs are longer/shorter. i don't know, I don't have the Swedish release."
,ChefAttack,2008-11-19T03:26Z,Thanks for the awesome download!
,lucent,2009-04-16T08:47Z,"Flawed rip of My Truth (1999) / ""9. Giving You Back"" has errors beginning at 2m22s until the end. The CD must have been scratched when ripping. Thanks for sharing anyways! Robyn is a quality pop artist."
,pingu666,2009-07-21T23:24Z,"I bought ""Don't stop the music"" in the store today but when I came home I discovered that the disc is copy controlled and I'm not allowed to make a copy for my Ipod. Robyn, I'm a fan but I don't want to have the record company restrict what I can do with my own legal copies. Thank you Pirate Bay for the MP3s."
