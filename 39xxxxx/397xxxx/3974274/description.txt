I've been a big fan of Robyn since I first heard her back in the mid 1990's.  It sucks living in the USA, because it is difficult at times to get her music.  I thought I'd give back to the Pirate Bay Community by seeding all four of Robyn's Albums.  I hope this helps some of you who have been searching for her music.
