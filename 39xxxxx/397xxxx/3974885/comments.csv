,Joost026,2008-04-06T17:07Z,Download finished in 30 minutes with 220KB/s average. Game works great! even works online on none PB servers. It asked for a CD key at launch but I just clicked accept and it worked.
,phiebs,2008-04-15T05:15Z,"Sorry, can anyone tell me where the q3config.cfg is stored IN THIS COPY. 
It's not in /users/UNAME/.q3a/baseq3
nor in /baseq3
nor in the quake3 package itself...

But it is saving my name changes so I know it is somewhere!! I just want to change the screen resolution to widescreen but I can't find it anywhere. 

Great torrent by the way :)"
,VileCore,2008-06-04T13:03Z,"Theo: If you are getting that problem with all torrentz on site, I can exclusively tell you that it's just you. Have fun solving that.
I, on the other hand, have no problems with this site. "
,karltech,2008-07-10T02:40Z,"Works for me, I noticed however its a pure PPC application, yet runs just fine under rosetta on my 2008 macbook (The lowest end configuration) running OS  X 10.5.4"
,photogra4,2008-08-08T06:21Z,How do you get a gamepad (logitech) to work with this? I have been looking everywhere but can't seem to figure it out. 
,c-more,2008-10-05T13:05Z,"Any idea why the game keeps crashing after completing each arena. Also which version should I run? i m using an imac 24"" 3.06ghz 10.5.5"
,TheHardmast3r,2008-10-14T19:25Z,how i can instal??
,COM.UNIST,2008-11-20T03:54Z,"Awsome, i had never played Quake before (or any other FPS computergames for that matter) but my friends want to have a lan-party so i said i would learn to play. I suck of course but it sure is fun to blast of at some alienskeleton :)

Thanks for the upload, i had no problems with the file, just download, unzip, click and play. Got it real fast too, thanks for the seeding comrades.
Gonna keep seedin, this is a good one."
,keenytn1,2008-11-21T15:40Z,"@phiebs

I would also like to know where q3config.cfg is in THIS release. Does anyone know??"
,UncleUnko,2008-11-27T09:12Z,"Q3A writes a config file if you don't create it yourself. It stores a config file for each ""mod"" in the mod's home folder. For straight Q3A I believe it stores it in the ""Base3Q"" folder.

What I wnt to know is why the Uploader didn't tell us what version it is??? There's like 20 or 30 different revisions to this game. I have 3 different ones installed on my Mac Pro 8-core and they all work real smooooth! :)
