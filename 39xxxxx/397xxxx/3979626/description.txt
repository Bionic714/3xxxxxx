The protagonist of the series is a Doctor Doom-like supervillain named Golgoth who has successfully defeated all superheroes and conquered the world, but must now contend with internal power struggles. The series was originally published by Gorilla Comics, a company formed by Mark Waid, Kurt Busiek and several others, but the company folded after only two issues were produced. Empire was completed under the DC Comics label but is in its own distinct universe.
