,RL.marton,2008-07-14T09:19Z,Could someone seed this please. 
,giggedyguy,2008-10-04T23:02Z," Been waiting for this movie for over 5 years! Okay, the movie should play fine using a proper video player. The remaining percentage usually comes from a changed file without having created a new torrent from the changed source. I've been through this myself while uploading Koi Mil Gaya (  http://bt.avistaz.com/details.php?id=bc6e1bba45b081a4439cc8736d40d30b363a9477  ). Took forever to figure it out. I really appreciate you efforts!!!

My thoughts: VLC needs to go, as it uses huge resources, loads very slowly and the subs always look lousy. GOM player and another I can't recall is much better. You can move the subs, change the color, font, speed. You'll have no trouble playing files."
