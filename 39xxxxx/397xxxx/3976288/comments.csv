You don't have any Spelt Like This tracks??"
[V],80zforever,2008-01-15T05:01Z,"Hi kaleef14 , I do have their two singles from 1985, i think four songs in total. If I am able to find them in my collection I will put them in Rare 80's compilation. One thing though, It would be a bit tought to find 4 songs in a 90 G archive that are on over 100 CDR lol."
