,serbgrafikz,2008-01-13T02:31Z,"eu = communism?
i live in the us and iam serbian, i guarantee you that us is the biggest comunist state of all!!!!"
,NewGod,2008-01-13T09:37Z,In communism citizens are not allowed to own firearms. Think about that.
,BakuninXL,2008-01-13T09:58Z,"Yep, in communism, and similar systems  for that matter, they want the people to be disarmed and helpless! In America they are currently trying to disarm the peole as well!"
,Thine_alterego,2008-01-14T23:17Z,"There is a crucial point - the larger the empire, the less individual freedom. I am not exactly Bakuninist, but in this respect, you can see that large countries (in population as well as area) have severe freedom deficiencies. 
The ultimate question is then: What is the largest free country in the world?"
,roflontex,2008-01-22T15:38Z,"Not this crap again! For some reason people who are not EU citizens try to raise negative opinions and arguments about the EU - sometimes this works: In the UK the media has even claimed false accusations against the EU. Stating opininon based arguments as facts is not good journalism, do these people even know what communism means? 

""--who spent many years in Russian labour camps and psychiatric prisons for defending human rights"", so this guy didn't even visit the soviet union, just Russia? Do you really think that one is free to defend human rights in Soviet Union or Russia without the local authorities trying to stop 'em? Based on the info text this guy is not even capable of lecturing in a non-bias matter.

As I have studied the EU a lot during the last three years I have to admit I find these kind of ""documentaries"" rather upsetting when the majority of people are not even capable of studying media critically! Not everything they say in documentaries is true. This documentary seems more political than informing - based on the informative text applied. 

""We do not want to become an indifferent mix-race just having one language and no culture like Russia, China, or the Americans!"" so if this is what Europe is all about then why are there several different official languages in the EU parliament? And what the hell, Russia, China and America have no culture? Amazing someone can really state something that ignorant! "
