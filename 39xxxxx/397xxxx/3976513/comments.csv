Some really great uploads. I'm having a problem with this one though. Using version 6 on macbook with OSX, and I have no problem installing the drummachines. Although, when i start Live and try to use the machines, it crashes when loading (or before loading) the samples. Do you have any solution, or idea what could cause this?"

,jimmay,2009-02-25T11:09Z,Jallan9: I'm pretty sure live6 doesn't support this. I think it said on their website requires 7
