-=AMG Review=- by Greg Prato

So you're on the lookout for a Lynyrd Skynyrd compilation that includes all their renowned classics, while also offering a few uncommon nuggets? Well, 2007's Forever Lynyrd Skynyrd is a solid starting point. While there are a few other Skynyrd comps that include a slightly lengthier track listing (namely 2006's Ultimate Collection), Forever Lynyrd Skynyrd still manages to do a fine job as a primer. Expectedly, such renowned Skynyrd anthems as "Sweet Home Alabama," "Free Bird," and "What's Your Name?" are all included, as well as such radio favorites as "That Smell," "Gimme Three Steps," and "Gimme Back My Bullets." No surprises and no questionable track listing decisions here. Forever Lynyrd Skynyrd accomplishes what every solid career overview should do ? balances the classics with strong album cuts, that in many cases, could have easily become hits on their own.
