Bob Dylan and Freddy Koella 

I REMEMBER YOU  - DVD Compilation

A coMpilation in honour of Freddy Koella, lead guitarist in Bob Dylan\'s Band during the
summer and fall 2003 Tour and the spring 2004 TOur.
Koella arrived, took the lead and played all of the many Dylansongs in that period without a problem.
He was a brilliant guitarist which was (sadly) not recognised by all fans. Most of them could not get
past the loss of Charlie Sexton. 
Koella never played the same solo, not even the next day playing the same song as the night before.
Just compare this to, let\'s say Denny Freeman and I rest my case.

During this tour many guest guitarists joined Dylan on stage. In this compilation Chuck Loeb 
and Tommy Morrongiello are present. Loeb with the best solo I ever heard in Dylan\'s band.
He plays it in Watching the river flow and the taper does not know who is responsible for this 
really great solo. He films every guitarist but forgets the man playing behind Dylan\'s position.

I like to thank and honour all tapers for their material!!!
