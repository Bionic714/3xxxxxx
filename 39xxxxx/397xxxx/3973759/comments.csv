Hope you like my compilation.
After downlad please stay seeding untill at least a 1:1 ratio so I can disconnect."

The correct order of songs is in the textfile of the torrent and in the menu of the disc.
Sorry abuot that."

Thanks for your magnificent compilation of songs on DVD. I agree that Freddy was one of the best guitarists Dylan's ever had, albeit for a short (well, what's short in the Never Ending Tour?) while. Freddy used to play with Willy DeVille, didn't he? So he must be used to arrogant pricks...:-)

I've seen Dylan on stage with Freddy on the guitar with my father in Paris, Le ZĂŠnith. It was pretty good, though my father tought it was too loud.

Anyway, thanks a bunch for this great material!!

Cheers and- yes- to your health~~~~~~

ps. I don't like Denny Freeman either......"
