Do you have any intentions of finishing what you have started? Or your another fake?"
,chandni7,2008-01-26T23:17Z,"I'm trying to seed, but after i turned my computer off the last percents kind of disappeared. And i'm not the best of these things so I don't know what to do"
,WhoWhatWhere123,2008-02-04T09:05Z,Can somebody please seed?  I've been stuck at 75% for ages now.  Thanks in advance!!

,alegrand77,2008-02-23T11:59Z,Hey! Please seed! Currently I'm the only one who's seeding but I'm stuck at 76.5% and it didn't go any further for a few hours now!!!
,kb_134,2008-04-27T05:37Z,"I've noticed that Azureus version 2.4.0.2 will not send any packets to version 3.0.5.2 (the most current version; the version I use) for this torrent. Myself and others (seems it's only those NOT running 2.4.0.2 are still OK) are stuck on this torrent at 74.3%, even though I am connected to multiple seeds and scores of peers. What gives?"
,kb_134,2008-04-27T05:43Z,"Sorry for double comment. I MEANT to say that only those WHO ARE running Azureus 2.4.0.2 are able to download the entire package. Others, like me, are stuck at 74.3% and I have no idea why."
,chandni7,2008-05-04T01:21Z,has anyone been able to download everything? or are there missing pieces? as I see it now there are someone that has 95% but seems like others have the remaining 5%...
