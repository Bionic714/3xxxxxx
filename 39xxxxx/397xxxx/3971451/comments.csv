[T],oddeven,2008-03-27T06:41Z,"damn, soyroca, read the description before complaining.  It's in Danish, get over it!
4 complaints, only from you!
The language option is for the subtitles.
If I didn't have the ""original"", how many versions of the movie do you expect me, the idiot, to have?"

[T],Pylypas_von_Kanapes,2009-03-26T20:55Z,"I don`t know nothing about the quality of this torrent, but the movie itself is amazing, with deep philosophical charge in it.
It`s about a madness that is acted - madmen are not real, they are enjoying pretending mentally retarded.
The madness, idiocy is cool thing untill it is like a game. But who would dare transpose idiocy into real life settings?
There are a lots of funny scenes watching this movie, but the final will probably will make some watchers move to tears."
,KaVaLaRhS,2010-03-29T02:03Z,"AHAHHAHAHAHHA
SEEDERS: 21
LEECHERES: 22"
,cinesimon,2010-03-30T20:20Z,"Bad combing, 4X3 version.
How anyone can call this uncompressed is beyond me... It's unwatchable."
[T],oddeven,2010-06-03T08:33Z,"uncompressed, is, well, uncompressed.

cinesimon: do you have the same edition in a larger file - I think not.

What a silly comment...

the original aspect ratio, 1.37:1, is pretty much 4:3.  

Do you think I can magically add dimension to films just to please you???"
,okyup,2011-11-03T17:20Z,"Thank you. Downloaded this 2 years ago.
One of my favorite films. :)"
