Injustice System

Freedom - A right I thought we had
One that no one could take away
But there are those who will try
To rule the lives that you and I choose to lead

We must fight - Injustice system
Have no rights - Injustice system
We must fight - Injustice system
Have no rights - Injustice system

There are those who change the laws
For gain and furthering their needs
A small group possesse the power
A minority dictating what's good for the majority
Money has the real influence
Without it what we say don't make a difference
I won't tell you to give in
But to me there's got to be a better way to fight for our rights
And to have our say
To choose for ourselves
And not be led around blindly on a short leash

We must fight - Injustice system
Have no rights - Injustice system
We must fight - Injustice system
Have no rights - Injustice system

Freedom - A right I'll always have
One that no one can take away
No matter what it is they try
Because the flame of freedom burns deep down inside of me"
