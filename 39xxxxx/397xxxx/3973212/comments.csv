,neofaith,2008-03-31T09:22Z,I met Mystery at a book signing with Neil Strauss back in December here in Hollywood.  He's a really nice guy! He didn't even know me but he took out the time to explain to me in detail some of his techniques on how to merge sets and even gave me a couple new openers when I asked him :0)

,RedLeader0083,2008-09-01T12:06Z,"Hey guys is there anyone here who can upload the remainder of the Interview Series?

There is now a Volume 21-30 now on demonoid (showing as Love Systems Interview Series), however the codes I requested didn't work or were used up already.

Can someone Seed at least High End Club Game please?
Thanx"
