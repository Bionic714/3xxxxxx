,Hampaman70,2008-01-13T16:55Z,"WHO gives a shit, asshole? It's DVD-format and it says GAME. Be happy that people share and stop wining and acting file police. "
,skunkworks2000,2008-01-14T01:14Z,"Hampaman70 you're so right, if you haven't got anything constructive to put in keep out. I found this whilst searching DVDR movies so now my daughter will have some fun with this that she'd have otherwise missed. Thanks for the mistake leesmith1970. More like that anyone? :)"
,leesmith1970,2008-01-14T16:20Z,my apologies for the oversight and putting it into the wrong category how will i ever sleep tonight maybe if chrisar uploaded some torrents he would realize how easy it is to make the mistake ps sorry for any delay came home from work today and computer was turned off so sorry for any delays in upload
,leesmith1970,2008-01-15T23:56Z,just a quick question as im pretty new to uploading but i have downloaded around 7gb of this game already and when i check on peers most people at present are at around 40 to 50 per cent downloaded is this so high because so many are trying to upload or have some people taken the full 100 per cent and then left instead of sharing 
,leesmith1970,2008-01-20T20:27Z,my apologies to everyone out there downloading this was offline for two days while i was getting a virus taken out of my computer put there by a tosspot on this site have got it removed but took download down incase it spread to the movie files and anyone else uploaded it back online and should have other people at 100% and seeding along with me soon
