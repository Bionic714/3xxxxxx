,dnsbubba,2008-01-30T06:41Z,"I have no idea what Optimistocrat's issue is, but I for one search out Klaxxon's torrents, and have never once been disappointed.

Keep up the good work."
,markisthejob,2008-02-02T18:35Z,I agree.I search for axxo or klaxxon movies because I know the quality will be good. 
,mikeil20,2008-02-03T19:51Z,Im kinda new but Klaxxon hooked it up on there will be blood
,ikilledsanta,2008-05-16T06:37Z,"I've downloaded from klaxxon many times and the movies have always been top notch. His videos are high quality, and they usually have a lot of seeders.

The only one better than klaxxon is axxo."
,Liquid_Mode,2008-05-21T06:38Z,Made an account Just so i could say THANK YOU for this torrent
,filecore,2008-06-04T10:46Z,"I can't speak for the quality of this until it's finished downloading, but you do realise that ""klaxxon"" is so named because any search for axxo films will also find klAXXOn releases... it's all in the name ;-)"
,Krasser,2008-06-19T19:50Z,"Great! Thanks for the up.

Klaxxon is t3h r0x0r when it comes to older movies with lots of seeders ^^"
,giggedyguy,2008-06-30T05:32Z,"Is this the directors cut or another version still? The directors cut came out back in the 90's, so just wondering how different this is. "
,teamsamson888,2008-07-17T13:15Z,Thanks
,MCWraith8,2008-08-07T19:46Z,Assuming the release info is correct this is the Final directors cut.  The original directors cut was little more than a studio sponsored cut to drive up sales which cut the voiceovers and added a happy ending.  This is director Ridley Scots definitive authorized cut. 
,3261dan,2008-08-21T16:44Z,"So this has all the cut content put back in yeah?   Wheres these unicorns I keep reading about? hehe 
  Thanks for this KLAXXON"
