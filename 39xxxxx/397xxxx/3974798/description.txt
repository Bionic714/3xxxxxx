Gary Lineker presents highlights from all of yesterday's seven Premier League fixtures, including Newcastle's trip to Manchester United. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's brace gave the Red Devils victory in last season's fixture, while Wayne Rooney struck twice to help his side beat the Magpies by the same 2-0 scoreline in 2005/06. Rooney has scored six goals in the last six league games against Newcastle so will no doubt lead his side's attack, if fit.

Liverpool visited Middlesbrough where they had come away without a win on their five previous visits, while Arsenal hosted Birmingham and Aston Villa played Reading. Everton and Manchester City met in a clash which could have repercussions for both their hopes of qualifying for Europe next season. Plus, West Ham and Fulham faced each other in a London derby while Pride Park was the venue for a relegation battle between Derby and Wigan.
