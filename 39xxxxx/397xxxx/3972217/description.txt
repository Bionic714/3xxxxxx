A confronting report in which fit and healthy elderly Australians reveal plans to take their own lives before they lose their independence.

...
Lorna, Richard and Muriel lead lives that are rich and full Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ but they intend to deliberately end their lives when they think the time is right.

They are among an increasingly activist minority of elderly Australians who say they will commit suicide before they are overtaken by frailty, illness or dependence. Such a radical step, they claim, is a final act of self-determination and a human right.

Four Corners has been told hundreds of Australian seniors are planning to take their own lives to pre-empt the inevitable loss of autonomy. \"This is about the dignity of the end of my life,\" says Muriel. \"I just donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t want to end up as a vegetable,\" says June. \"I donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t want to be locked up in a nursing home where all you get is bingo and singsongs,\" says Ruth.
