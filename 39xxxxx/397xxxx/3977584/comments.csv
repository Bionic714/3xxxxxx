,sabandjen,2008-01-18T07:28Z,"PLEASE HELP !!!!!!

ok i installed the SIMS 2 by replacing the existing ""sims.app"" with the cracked ""sims.app"" in the SIMS dmg folder.

i hope thats right cause the game works. when i tried clicking on the included (non-cracked) sims.app, its says please insert original disc.

however when i unpacked the university dmg and double clidked the installer app, it says ""the installation of the Sims 2 is not valid. install the sims 2 again to fix your problem. i dont understand... i tried putting the installer file into differnent folders, restarting, nothing...seems i cant get any of these EP's to work.

any help???

,elfhunterr,2008-01-18T11:41Z,"i`ve installed all the eps,and no problem was occured.
don`t get keyed or cover the app file by the creak file before you install all eps,just do what readme says""install all the eps and run creak for seasons""
before open for business the game is not Universal.

i am kanda busy these days and i am going somewhere else for about 15 days,so i am afraid i won`t seed for the coming 15 days.
sorry about that and i will certainly seed when i am back.

,lesterbator,2008-01-27T18:33Z,"LEOPARD USERS -

this is what worked for me (finally!):

install in the order that elfhunterr's readme suggested.

after you install seasons, don't use the patch in this torrent, use torrent below:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3993586/Sims_2_Seasons_Crackfix_(Leopard)

install the patch, and then it asks which sims 2 app you want to modify - go to your sims 2 folder and select the sims 2 seasons icon.

it should patch it and say successful once it's done, double click the sims 2 season icon in your sims 2 folder and it should run perfect!


enjoy!"

Just right click the sims seasons executable and choose ""Show package Contents"". Navicate into Contents -> Resources -> Mac OS  (or something like that) until you see the The Sims 2 executable. Right click on it, and choose GET INFO.  Under Permissions and Sharing, just set everything to read/write. You will have to click the lock symbol to be able to make changes to the permissions.

For those a little more command line savvy, just execute chmod 777

,fishee,2008-04-13T19:12Z,"This has been so frustrating. I bought the two first games (Sims 2 & University) but downloaded the rest in a torrent and everything was working fine until entire neighbourhoods were getting deleted for no known reason. I decided to install the Aspyr patch that was supposed to be the 'cure all' and I could no longer use The Sims without a CD. So I deleted everything (amazing Sims and houses) and decided I would start from scratch and use my actual dvd. Now it tells me that I can't use the Sims 2, that I have Seasons and have to use that. I don't have it. The patch won't work. I just ordered Bon Voyage and I really hope I can get this stupid game to finally work. This is very frustrating. Anyone know how to install the patch? I guess the version of Seasons in this torrent doesn't match the version necessary for the patch to work."

Here it is, the Seasons crack supplied in this torrent does not work, you need to downlod this crack fix

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3993586/Sims_2_Seasons_Crackfix_(Leopard)

once youve downloaded that, you must also download and install PSeudo 

http://personalpages.tds.net/~brian_hill/pseudo.html

once you have both downloads, make sure Seasons is installed, run Pseudo, and drag the crackFix crack into Pseudo, once the crack window opens, drag the Sims @ Seasons icon from your Sims 2 directory and watch the magic happen....IT WORKS!!!!!


seriously, it does "
,vanilla87,2008-05-02T05:53Z,"I've been trying to download this for the last 3 days and its still saying it will be downladed in 2 days. I'm being fair while i download this, I've set the upload time for all other that are trying to download at 40kbs, so that they can get a fair chance, BUT no one is doing the same so that people can have this in time, which isn't fair to us who are trying to down load it. If your not going to seed at 20kbs or more, then your not going by a true seeder rules in sharing."
,andy721,2008-05-06T11:03Z,Doesn't work they took the torrent down.
,XDmuch,2008-06-15T01:24Z,"I found all these comments so confusing, yet they turned out to be helpful.
Still, I thought a little guide of what I did might help others.
Just to be absolutely clear: THIS WORKS. I started downloading the torrent three days ago and it completed tonight, and that's with a sucky ISP that Azureus hates. Yes, I have Azureus, and these worked.

I moved the folder to my desktop from the Azureus download folder.
Launched Sims 2 installer, dragged folder into Applications when it said to.
Launched University, but it gave an error referring to the filepath of the Sims 2 being on the desktop, not in Applications. 
Ejected both DMGs, dragged Sims 2 and University to the desktop.
Cracked Sims 2 original, dragged the cracked icon into the Sims 2 folder, and launched it once to test. It was working fine at this point.

Then mounted Sims 2 university, tried installing and it worked. I think my problem was that I'd had BOTH DMG's MOUNTED. You HAVE to have just ONE at a time, the computer recognizes that more than one can't be in the drive at the same time and deliberately stops the installation.

After each expansion is installed, eject the disk image before moving on to the next. Also, don't install the cracks for any except the VERY last one. Just install the original DMG and move on.

Now for Nightlife.
Now for Business.
Now for Pets.
The mini-patch in the Pets folder (not the crack) is next.
Then, Family Fun Stuff.
Glamour Life Stuff next.
Then, install the Seasons. This is the last expansion.
I made a copy of the Sims 2 folder, just because I'm paranoid like that. :)

The crack included in the Seasons folder quit the moment I launched it, every time I tried.

I'd read that Leopard users should use this torrent -- http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3993586/Sims_2_Seasons_Crackfix_(Leopard -- to download the patch separately. I did so (that one was also a very fast download, five minutes max) and selected the ORIGINAL app icon (if you dragged the crack icon into the Sims 2 folder, don't select that one)... it said it needed to change permissions, I put in my password, and it successfully patched. I guess some people need to use Pseudo and others don't?

And, just for reference... iMac G5 Intel running Leopard 10.5.3, very up-to-date and this still works perfectly. The game window is right behind this right now! 

If you're having trouble, I could try and help you... send an email to me (XDmuch(at)gmail(dot)com). ^_^

And remember to seed after you're done... I'll be seeding for a couple months. ;)

Hope this helps someone!"

I DID NOT HAVE ANY of the problems other people are having issues with. 

I followed the install directions NONE of them were corrupt, everything installed quick and smooth. 

The only snag I hit was patching seasons. Which wasn't hard. IF you look at the comments there is a link to another crack and I used psuedo to open it and it works flawlessly. 

I'm not having wunky graphics, no broken files, no town restrictions. This is a GREAT torrent. Don't be like me and read comments from idiots I guess and decide not to download because it worked great.

The two seeders aren't even seeding because they closed their upload limit.  Meanwhile there's 13 other seeds online who aren't seeding either.  Why not seed this while you play the game, guys?  Ever since torrents became mainstream this is what's happened.

It will only take a little while to get the torrent health back up."
,littlelulu,2008-10-27T02:41Z,"Ok so I FINALLY got it all working after a few tries, this is thanks to user XDmuch (she commented on page 4/5 with really good instructions) but I got even more detailed instructions from her so if anyone is still getting errors of any sort, follow these but make sure you read it VERY carefully and follow every little instruction :)

******You HAVE to have just ONE disk image mounted at a time, the computer recognizes that more than one can't be in the drive at the same time and deliberately stops the installation.******

Mount Sims 2.dmg, and drag the folder into Applications like it prompts you to.
Eject the Sims 2 DMG now.
Then, look in the same folder (Sims2) for The Sims 2 cracked.app.sit, unzip it with Stuffit Expander.
An icon called ""The Sims 2 cracked"" will appear now. Drag that icon into your Sims 2 folder in Applications, and then launch The Sims 2 with the original icon to test if you want.

Then, mount the Sims 2 University disk image, and install it.

After each expansion is installed, eject the disk image before moving on to the next. Also, don't install the cracks for any except the VERY last one, which I'll go into more detail about. Just install the original DMG and move on.

Mount and install Nightlife.
Mount and install Business.
Mount and install Pets.
   Find The Sims 2 Pets 1.6 Rev A Installer in the Pets folder. ****IGNORE Sims2.Pets.1.6A.29530.Crack****
   Unzip it to find ""The Sims 2 Pets 1.6 Rev A Installer"" and launch it, go through the steps of the Sims 2 Pets Installer. (like re-install Pets again)
Mount and install Family Fun Stuff.
Mount and install Glamour Life Stuff.
Then, mount and install Seasons. This is the last expansion.

If you're paranoid, and have plenty of disk space, make a copy of the Sims 2 folder in Applications, just to be safe. You still likely won't be able to get into the Sims 2, as it'll want the disk.

If the crack included in the Seasons folder, ""Patch No DVD The Sims 2 Seasons.dmg"" quits the moment you launch it, you need the updated version of it. Download it from here: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3993586/Sims_2_Seasons_Crackfix_(Leopard"
,littlelulu,2008-10-27T02:42Z,"(Continued)..

When you run that one, select the ORIGINAL Sims 2 application icon (if you dragged ""The Sims 2 cracked"" into the Sims 2 folder in Applications, don't select that one). If it prompts you to change permissions, put in your password, and it should successfully patch.

When you finally run the game, use ""The Sims 2"" (the original icon again, that is, not the Cracked icon) to do so.

If this works for you it's all thanks to xdmuch!!
"
,littlelulu,2008-10-27T02:46Z,"OH and one more thing...

If you open the seasons crack, and get to the point where it asks you for your password to change permissions, but then after that it says ""Error"" then you have to download Pseudo from this site:

http://personalpages.tds.net/~brian_hill/pseudo.html

Open pseudo, and also have the crack window open and then drag the crack onto pseudo and then the crack should open up again like before,   so go through the same steps of selecting the original sims 2 icon into the crack, but this time it shouldn't give you an error!!

Hope this works for ya!

,Srabies,2008-10-31T15:16Z,"When I started the installation I followed the directions posted on page 6 to the letter.
Everything worked flawlessly up until it came time to install the sims seasons.

When I click the Sims2seasons.dmg, instead of an installation screen.  I get an error screen that informs me that thesims2seasons.dmg failed to mount, because it is not recognized.  

Is there any way I can correct this?
If not, is there a working crack for the sims2pets?

When I try to use the crack included with this torrent, it quits automatically, and instantaneously.  

And a final question.  Since all of the files are still on my hard drive, should none of the questions actually pan out.  Could I buy a sims 2 seasons and just install it?

The Leopard patch on page 8 didn't work for me and I kept getting SHA1 errors on my system (10.5.6) just like you guys..

I Fixed that by:

1) Downloading iPatch 3.7.1 from (http://www.ipatch.org/iPatch3.7.1.dmg)
2) Mount the file 
3) Right Click the iPatch application -> Show Package Contents
4) Open Contents Folder
5) Open Resources Folder
6) Right Click iPatcher -> Show Package Contents
7) Open Contents Folder
8) Open MacOS Folder
9) Copy the iPatcher file (212 kb)

10) Go find the Seasons Crack application (probably called ""The Sims 2 Seasons UBCrack"")
11) Right Click the application -> Show Package Contents
12) Open Contents Folder
13) Open MacOS Folder
14) Paste the iPatcher file here to replace to old one

When you're done installing seasons, replace the ""The Sims 2.app"" file with the updated crack, and you're all set! If it tells you you can't replace it because it already exists, just delete the original one. As long as the new one has the same ""The Sims 2.app"" name as the original one, it will work fine."

If that is the case than you should just check if you (or your computer) moved anything around.
I had a similar problem at first, but then I checked the disk and my Sims 2 were in the applications folder instead of the actual disk drive, where all of the other contents are (there should be a folder called ?Sims 2? with Bodyshop and other stuff in it)

,sublimeacoustic,2009-05-30T05:30Z,"So, has anyone figured out what is wrong with university and nightlife and how it can be fixed?

A lot of people have been asking and it seems like no one has a clue.

What do we do?!"
,blackfeather,2009-05-31T20:25Z,"For those having problems with Nightlife and University expansions., heres how I was able to make it work:

I had installed everything in order, but in a non-default location (basically, a second ""Applications' directory that I placed under my User account folder, not the system Applications folder which is shared by all users.

I played the game and noticed these expansions werent there. 

After checking in the System level Applications folder (the default location), I saw there was also a ""The Sims 2"" directory placed there, even though there shouldnt have been. I peeked inside it, and there is an ""Expansion Packs"" subfolder, and below that are ""Nightlife"" and ""Univeristy"" subfolders. 

I checked the actual install folder, and sure enough, those two expansion packs are missing from there. So I simply moved over those directories to where ""The Sims 2"" is actually running from, and everthing worked fine after that.

Be sure to copy each Expansion Pack folder individually, and not the top level folders, or you could erase data. You should NOT get a ""Would you like to replace this..?"" dialog when copying.

Cheers"

Its only fair because people don't know how to seed and the ones that do don't play by the rules. For the ones that actually seed out more then 10-20kbs, thank you, because your helping people get what they want.

Its all about supply and demand here. So you supply some 30kbs+ for uploading and you will get 30kbs+ in return for downloading your file.

So please share if your done downloading or even half way finished so that it takes less time to download for everyone. Thank You.

It works fine for me :o) (I have an older iBook G4 PowerPC).
I just followed the simple instructions incl. in the ReadMe file. I installed Sims 2 (no crack), then the expansion packs (no cracks), in the order the instructions says. Since I didn't want University, Pets and Family Fun Stuff - I just skipped those. Finally, after installing Seasons, I ran the Seasons crack - and applied the patch to the Sims 2 game file. It took a while to apply the patch (be patient). 
That's it! I opened the game and everything works perfectly ;o) THANX!"

I have downloaded not from this torrent, but another one in another site that has been deleted, but I guess the files are the same.

Thanks for alexak for the tip, I finally succeded and can play The Sims 2 in my Mac.

1. Mount ""The Sims 2 - OSX.toast"" and copy to Applications Folder.
2. Install the expansions in that order: 
-University
-Nightlife
-Open for Business
-Pets
-Family Fun Stuff
-Glamour Life Stuff
-Seasons

3. Download the link suplied by alexak (page 9 here on comments) and do what says there.

alexak said at 2009-05-08 20:50 CET:
I'VE FIGURED OUT WHY THE CRACK ISN'T WORKING;

It's the wrong one! It's outdated. If you're using leopard, you need this one;
http://www.filestube.com/23b9d7070e6f7e9a03e9/details.html

When you're done installing seasons, replace the ""The Sims 2.app"" file with the updated crack, and you're all set! If it tells you you can't replace it because it already exists, just delete the original one. As long as the new one has the same ""The Sims 2.app"" name as the original one, it will work fine.

I said at 2010-06-06 6:27 MEX

After that install the patch as it says and VOILA! I'll test it and later on post if it start crashing or anything...

,u01dtj6,2011-03-21T18:33Z,"BE PATIENT!

This has taken me 4 days to solve. I NEVER thought this would work. Some might install this with no problems or issues at all. But I did! It was so frustrating. I SERIOUSLY RECOMMEND reading littlelulu's three comments on page 5 for anyone stuck. Follow each step exactly and you will be fine.

I would recommend if you have the disk space to install everything (in order as per the text file in the download), do it!

One thing that is not pointed out in the text file and also not so much within these comments is that you will need one additional program - STUFFIT EXPANDER (can be downloaded free from the Mac App Store, or here: http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/stuffitexpander.html)

You will need the stuffit expander to run ""The Sims 2 cracked.app.sit"". If you are clicking on it, and you find TextEdit pop up with loads of code (and then scratching your head), you will need this program for the .app.sit file to open properly.

Also, you may need the program ""Pseudo"" (found here: http://personalpages.tds.net/~brian_hill/downloads.html) if the seasons crack comes up with an ""Error"" message. If the seasons crack automatically closes, or it says please check with the developer, you need an up-to-date version of the crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3993586/Sims_2_Seasons_Crackfix_(Leopard

If you follow EXACTLY what littlelulu says, you will be laughing!
