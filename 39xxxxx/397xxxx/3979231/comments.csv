I just wanted to say FUCK YOU, to the guy who wrote it... cause he really pissed me off first thing in the morning... next time GET TO THE FUCKING POINT and do not patronize your reader, because no one appreciates that! If you meant to write the book in good will, then please take my advice and consider your reader a little more.... do not think you can patronize him or her."
