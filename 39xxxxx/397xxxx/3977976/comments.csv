,meinthai,2008-01-21T09:44Z,"SN works for install main app.  But calls home and wont work when you try to install the service pack 1.  If you disconnect from the internet during SP1 install you get a different error message, and still wont install.  

However the failed install of SP1 leaves the original app install untouched, and working.

I use it on a Mac, don't know how it works on PC"
,pep75,2008-01-21T18:59Z,"Exactly! I work on a PC but it has the same problem...The SP is necessary when you have a 64bit OS and 4gb of RAM, otherwise VW doesn't work....Yep, I do have and I have to unplug my sims when I use VW......pfffffff

Anyone suggestions???

,kingmaestro,2008-01-26T14:56Z,"HELP PLEASE!
I tried to instal vw2008 on a mac, intel osx10.4.11.
the installer quits / crashes. i tried with unzipping the parts as well. nothing works.

anyone knows how to install it right?

tnx in advance!"
,cheesemaster1980,2008-02-02T00:30Z,"Hey,
Having a similar problem. The installer says that the  serial is invalid.
Anyone have an idea?
Thanks!!!"
,tried.n.tested,2008-02-06T15:23Z,"Works fine, but the SP1 update has to connect with the Nemetschek website to validate the serial.

Obviously they know this serial is now compromised, so it fails to update, you might still be able to update to SP1 by installing the contents of the ZIP archives by hand.  Not tried that yet!"
,tried.n.tested,2008-02-06T17:18Z,"Updating with Service Packs:

Scratch that, just tried the unzip and copy route on the service packs, didn't work, clearly the installer must do more than just copy the files over.

Better go and buy it then! ;)"
,tried.n.tested,2008-02-06T17:33Z,"Just read this comment from quark512 who posted this torrent:

,themule,2008-02-07T11:27Z,"ok... have working with VW since it was MiniCad. got VW 12.5 and VW 2008 on my G5 PPC. the Service Packs don't work. You need them with OS X 10.5.+. Neither the SP for VW 12.5 or VW 2008 work if you don't have an original SN#. Have searched in many forums, blogs, crack sites, etc and nothing found... Need it for work!!! Guess i'm back to OS 10.4.9... Help!!!"

,typeseven,2008-02-12T22:06Z,"superfast download! am running OSX 10.4.11, installed the app no problem at all, decided not to install the SP1 seeing as some others had a problem with it.

ensure that you hang around following the succesful installation though as it tries to connect to nemetschek through safari - which i doubt many people will block with little snitch.

am seeding for at least a week as i'm very grateful for this bit of software!"
,bob.marley6400,2008-02-15T04:33Z,Where's the key?
,tried.n.tested,2008-02-15T12:54Z,"Can we get these updates working?

I've found a major bug with Layer Options (i.e. after a while you can't snap / select others layers even if the options are set to 'Show/Snap/Modify Others')

Which blows goats!"
,NosoyJavier,2008-02-15T16:13Z,"To ""tried.n.tested"" 

I can't reproduce the bug concerning Layer Options you have reported. The only way to make VWorks 2008 not to recognize other objects handle points is to place them on a layer with different scale than the active one. Otherwise it goes fine, as in previous versions of the application. Could you give more details, please? We're just testing the 2008 version to migrate 4 computers (Mac and Win) from 11.5 this weekend.

Many thanks."
,tried.n.tested,2008-02-16T15:04Z,"@NosoyJavier

I figured out what I did, I accidentally set the view out of Top/Plan so it couldn't snap (because it needs a true elevation).

Phew, not a bug, thank gawd for that!  But your post made me look into it further!  So thanks!

,Skipper-dom,2008-05-29T18:34Z,"This dl worked great on my Tiger mac. But now I have installed on a new Leopard mac and noticed that there are some bugs - crashes if you try to organise classes.

According to Nemetschek these have been sorted in SP1 and now there is SP2.

Problem is the updater phones home with a serial which Nemetscheck will not recognise as valid. If you prevent the connection with little snitch the updater will not work.

Is there a work around to get the updater to work.

Is there a later version of VW 2008 that has the update already included.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Please remember that if you are installing this on Leopard it will not be fully functioning unless you find a way of updating to at least SP1"
