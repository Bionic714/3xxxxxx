,artytorrent,2008-02-02T00:08Z,"Earlier today, I noticed this torrent had 300+ leechers. Was the link posted on a particular site I don't know about? I don't have a problem with lots of sharing (that's the point of torrents, after all) but I'd be interested to know who/where my torrents have been publicised."
