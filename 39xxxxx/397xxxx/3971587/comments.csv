,ezrydn,2011-02-05T01:31Z,"I, like many of you, hold a fondness for this high-speed experience.  Here's how I sidetracked all the problems people are dealing with.  
1.  Download Win 98 SE torrent.
2.  Load/Install it onto a thumb drive (I'm using a 4G)
3.  Install the game to your thumb drive.
4.  You'll have to keep the program either in your CD drive or on a virtual drive when you play.
5.  FYI, player ""Anakin"" doesn't save games.  Make yourself a player and save, Save, SAVE!"
