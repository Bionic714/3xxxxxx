Derailroaded.

A documentary on the life and music of manic-depressive, paranoid-schizophrenic cult music icon Wild Man Fischer who in the 60Ã?Â´s worked together with Frank Zappa.

Meet Larry - manic depressive, paranoid schizophrenic, rock legend. Featuring Frank Zappa, Gail Zappa, Weird Al Yankovic, Mark Mothersbaugh (Devo), Solomon Burke and Rosemary Clooney.

Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½DerailroadedÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ is the story of one manÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s discordant encounters with the music business and the maddening effects of his adventures on everyone else around him. A moving portrayal of a cult talentÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s struggle with fame and mental illness. Ã¢ï¿½Â¢Discovered by Frank Zappa, with whom he cut his first record, Fischer became an underground favourite overnight, earning him the title of the Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½godfather of outsider musicÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½. Over the course of 40 years, he appeared on national US television, was the first artist to be recorded on US independent Rhino Records, sang a duet with Rosemary Clooney and featured in John Peel\'s Festive Fifty. Ã¢ï¿½Â¢In between the highs, are the lows - institutionalized at 16, wandering LA streets singing songs to passers by for 10Ã?Â¢ and suffering countless anxiety attacks and fits of paranoia. Prepare to be moved, amazed and repelled. Prepare to understand what it means to be profoundly Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½DerailroadedÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½.
