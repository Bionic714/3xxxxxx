LOL :D"
,abbotmuff,2008-01-12T02:35Z,It has actually been aired aired in the UK already. I have already seen episode one so might not be fake.I'll d/load and let you know.
,StalKalle,2008-01-12T03:59Z,"Well I put in ""No Fakes"" because if I didnt people would probobly whrite it of as a fake at ones but now they atleast give it chanse.
Anyway, its up to you if you download it or not. It doesnt matter to me. 
The only reason I uploaded it was because some friends of mine really wanted to watch the episodes and the only copy was on a private tracker.
Thats also why its my first torrent here because I usaly never upload anything. This was a special case and only my 2:nd time ever uploading.

Som sagt, ni får tro vad ni vill."

itchychin,

Are u still reserving judgment as to its authenticity? c'mon now...say you're sorry for being a prick. :-)"
,whymenotu,2008-01-21T11:15Z,You folks DO realize that these episodes got accidently leaked on to the web right? These are real and I'd like to extend a HUGE thanks to StalKalle for the upload.
