  NOTES:
    
    Having developed from a childhood game, Free Running  
    has been given global recognition due to a series of  
    adverts for Toyota, Nike and the BBC to name a few.   
    The recognised creator of the discipline, which       
    involves running and jumping over buildings and any   
    other obstacles, comes to London with several others  
    landmarks of the city
