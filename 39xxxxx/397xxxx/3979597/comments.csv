instead of ""http://"" put ""hssp://"" or sumthing...
Or just change sumthing in the link (say, ""rapidshare"") to something else and tell us what to change :P"
,Metalmayhem,2008-01-16T12:14Z,"Part Iwww dot megaupload dot com /?d=ATH9RRHL

,ClanMaster,2008-01-16T12:26Z,This can't be right. Surely the file size is way too small... anyone got this working?
,EchoRob,2008-01-16T12:28Z,it is a real final release it's just that it been badly hacked and missing alot of stuff. It is English only

,rems92,2008-01-16T12:45Z,"Metalmayhem: I have DL your 2 files on mega, but I have tried several solutions to merge them using some hjsplit progs I found on the net, then I got a zip file that cannot uncompress...

,Pman3003,2008-01-16T13:18Z,"Can all of you who downloaded it from megaupload please seed here? It is the same dmg-file as in this torrent so just start download torrent, stop it, replace dmg-file and start seeding. I am seeding now, but I have only 90kb/s upload. Office 2008 seems to work ok on my macbook pro, i actually rememberd my preferences from the office 2008 beta."
,EchoRob,2008-01-16T13:31Z,"MS OFFICE 2008 for mac is crap why in the hell would u want this on ya mac ?

If you absolutely need to use office buy a god dam pc as the windows version is far superior"
,Pman3003,2008-01-16T13:40Z,"EchoRob - shut up, people want macs and the want office, idmit it!"
,sneakygerry,2008-01-16T13:51Z,"As a matter of fact there are three probs with the Windows version: PCs are generally garbage, Windows is crap and Office on Mac is actually better. in the meantime if you have a Mac, unfortunately, Word is definitely the best wordprocessor although some of the others come close. (I use both PC and MAC)"
,sneakygerry,2008-01-16T13:53Z,And we have a seed on this one. Keep up the good work.
,novousuario,2008-01-16T13:54Z,"How does the soft doc macx don cn works? I cannot go beyond the ""Click the ADs first"" button"
,EchoRob,2008-01-16T13:55Z,"Why do people want the os x version when its inferior to the windows version and if u need it for work the use the windows version

On osx ya better off with Ninus Writter Mariner neo office iworks"
,EchoRob,2008-01-16T13:56Z,Office on the mac is inferior 
,EchoRob,2008-01-16T13:58Z,Just look at excel how inferior the os x version is 
,deuxdoom,2008-01-16T14:00Z,"what's suck Password of MO2008.dmg.zip file..

MO2008.dmg.zip.001 + MO2008.dmg.zip.002 = MO2008.dmg.zip -> password what ???"
,Pman3003,2008-01-16T14:18Z,Password is Sephisto (capital s)
,vanastasis,2008-01-16T14:19Z,"deuxdoom:

double click on the 001 file then it will put it together by itself.
then open zip in stuffit then password prompt comes up enter it and bang will extract and mount dmg."
,sneakygerry,2008-01-16T14:23Z,"Dear EchoRob, as I already said: 
As a matter of fact there are three probs with the Windows version: PCs are generally garbage, Windows is crap and Office on Mac is actually better. in the meantime if you have a Mac, unfortunately, Word is definitely the best wordprocessor although some of the others come close. (I use both PC and MAC)
I see why you're called ECHOrob - you keep coming back with the same old shit"
,deuxdoom,2008-01-16T14:32Z,"thx buddies .. :)

"
,jacoblo33,2008-01-16T15:00Z,"Seems to work for me

Serial worked, installed fined, uninstalled previous office and up & running now

I am no expert on detecting fake ones, but no mention of beta or such. Version 12.0.0 in about window."
,EchoRob,2008-01-16T15:02Z,"Office on mac is inferior 

Everyone says it including Microsoft there are many missing important features


Dont be an ignorant fuck"
,jacoblo33,2008-01-16T15:14Z,Good for you retard. Why don't you shutup and not use it then?
,sneakygerry,2008-01-16T15:17Z,echoechoechorob
,devonaire,2008-01-16T15:35Z,I might be a bit thick but...........if there are 44 seeders why is my Azureus showing 0(5)?
,Mac_PPC,2008-01-16T15:59Z,"TPB must be great.  EchoRob spends all his time here.

Your right though, Office 2007 sucks so bad that 2008 just can't come close."
,dann345,2008-01-16T16:29Z,"I don't get it... how can it say 108 seeders, when I get 0.0Kb/s downloading speeds?! o.O"
,sneakygerry,2008-01-16T17:09Z,I've had at least 45 seeders connected on this download. 90% now and climbing. This is the one.
,Teluguman,2008-01-16T17:22Z,"Aight guys, so I successfully downloaded and installed it (thanks to all my seeders).

It def DOES work.  The dmg file is NOT split (so you don't need to join it).  The only key you will need is:

FWCQQ-3XX2G-3CD89-4VRJK-CR4YD

Sadly, I don't see that big of a difference b/w 2004 and 2008.  I just don't understand Microsoft.  (Also, it doesn't look much like 2007 for the PC, which might be a good thing).

I will keep seeding for all my buddies out there.  Thanks!"
,nottheold,2008-01-16T19:49Z,"anybody elses gets ""optimizing font menu"" and then nothing????? just crashes!!!!"
,masterbluestar,2008-01-16T20:14Z,ECHOROB if Piratebay is shithouse get the F off of it and stop shooting your cocksucking mouth off about software. That's your F opinions and this here is not a forum for software discussion of software quality or usefulness. Take your F'd up mouth and attitude elsewhere we don't need ya.
,hockpooh,2008-01-16T20:53Z,"Echorob is an ass, I downloaded that one from the site you posted and the dmg is password protected. Crawl off and die if you're going to screw with people, go back to the land of perverted evil PC users and stay away from us cool Mac Users."
,gialandra,2008-01-16T21:36Z,"The about tell: Vers 12.0.0 (071130).

What version is? beta?"
,hockpooh,2008-01-16T22:01Z,The Bete is 12.0.0  070919
,magneticpole,2008-01-17T04:07Z,How to be sure is not a modified software by NSA services ?
,hockpooh,2008-01-17T05:10Z,"OK, it download alright, and installed just fine. It's for real and works GREAT. It lets you delete your old 2008 beta and 2004 office and the end of the install. I kept my 2004 office but of course dumped the 2008 beta. As I said before, This Full version is Awesome."
,masterbluestar,2008-01-17T05:11Z,This seems totally clean and legit. Installed with success and have opened all apps fine. Entourage imported all my old stuff from Office 2004. There are some quirks in Leopard but with subsequent updates to both Leopard and Office I expect them to be fixed. Nothing major though... you can use all the apps now as they come.
,mysticalyute,2008-01-17T05:55Z,"This is so hot and it works really well and faster than the beta, im seeding guys for the next month, im also gonna try and put it on rapidshare or megaupload in a week or so...will keep you posted"
,Metalmayhem,2008-01-17T06:56Z,Already on megaupload look back at comments.
,thesmokestack,2008-01-17T19:23Z,does 2008 have any of the same issues as 2004 with checking the local network for other users using the same SN/key?
,Troels999,2008-01-17T19:29Z,They would have my personal info before it would open ? How can it be ?
,doctorfo,2008-01-17T19:43Z,thankyou very much...
,lazlazlaz,2008-01-18T04:46Z,"that is not a problem of this torrent, but Office 2008.

If you need input Chinese character, DO NOT USE office 2008 now, the Powerpoint will break all the Chinese code into individual, cannot use that AT ALL.

SERIOUS BUG."
,BlackStormBSS,2008-01-18T06:12Z,"ok, I have downloaded this one and am seeding. Will be for about 5 more hours till I go home. Will seed over the weekend at home all the time. Hope that helps."
,jonasbaud,2008-01-19T01:05Z,"Can anyone tell me what version of Mac:messenger is included in Office 2008? I'm only interested in the messenger, so I will only download if the version is newer than 6.03..

Thnx in advance"
,jonasbaud,2008-01-19T01:07Z,"ow nevermind, i kinda found out messenger is not included.. :("

,Dizaztor,2008-01-19T12:11Z,"Im still downloading but Im assuming Microsoft still keeps good OLD messenger in the 2008 pack.

If it helps to know, when youre istalling the whole pack, be sure to know that your installing pre-historic MSN messenger."

,KingYaba,2008-01-23T08:53Z,I only have a 60kb/s upload but since I downloaded this off of Megaupload I figure I'll be a nice guy and seed. :)
,Kimmel,2008-01-23T12:13Z,"I'm sitting in a 1.300 person network at my school, and I haven't seen anything that would indicate that it checks for the multi-use of the same key.. 

Which btw is FWCQQ-3XX2G-3CD89-4VRJK-CR4YD - if you need it.. =) 

I would assume that at least one of my fellow school mates have this copy, since it's the easiest  copy to get - and it works just wonderful.. 
(..and I gave to a few people as well..)

Thank you, Metalmayhem.. =P "
