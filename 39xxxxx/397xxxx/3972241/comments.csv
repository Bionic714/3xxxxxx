,d3synguy,2008-01-13T04:13Z,I downloaded this torrent. I burned it to CD. I also mounted it using PowerIso and I mounted it using Daemon Tools. I'm really new to this .iso stuff so I don't know what I may be doing wrong. I am unable to install from the CD nor the virtual drives. There do not appear to be any .exe files nor Setup files that I can run. what is it that I should be doing?

he says clearly it is cd size. it is called a lite version. it is a less weighed down version of vista that doesn't come with 2 extra gb of bullshit. 

thanks for the torrent, just need a 64 bit version to put some raid drivers on."
