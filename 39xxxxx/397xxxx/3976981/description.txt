This game will be based on the book Inhabited Island written by Strugatsky brothers. THE ISLAND is a first-person adventure quest with panoramic environments. 

This is the age of mankind's prosperity. FSG Pilots (Free Search Group) are exploring the universe. Our Hero - Maksim Kammerer - is forced to perform an emergency landing on the planet Sarraksh, where, a few minutes after, his ship is destroyed and he becomes a prisoner on the unknown planet.

It turns out that there is human civilization on this planet. Its level of development is much like the level of our civilization in the 20th century. A protracted nuclear war almost completely destroyed the planet's ecology, and the surviving population still suffers. Their painfully obtained peace remains very unstable and a loathsome truth is hidden behind it. Maksim Kammerer must break through a veil of lies to find out what it is.

Maksim will go through military service, join rebels. He'll do time in a penal camp and will also encounter mutants.
