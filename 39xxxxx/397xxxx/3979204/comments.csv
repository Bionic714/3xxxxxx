Episode 8 was the intended pilot for the show but was re-edited and cut down to 45min. This torrent is for the 2hr original pilot (1hr 40mins + 20 mins of clips taken from Season 1).

Nothing to do with it being an OpenDML file m8; more because it's an OpenDML file that's been produced by AVIMuxGUI (but ffs don't tell Alex Noe I said that :).

Plenty of programs will convert it to your wee heart's desire :) VirtualDub is prolly the best (& cheapest since it's free!).

However, since it already HAS been encoded using the XviD encoder (see? u didn't even HAVE to ask :), no conversion (of the Video) is really necessary.

Just run it thru VirtualDub using direct stream copy of the video.  You WILL have to do a full processing of the Audio since an (illegal?) VBR encoding was done on that (Why, I have no idea coz the use 149kbps bitrate must have cancelled any savings the VBR might have offered, ffs!).

I suggest recompressing the audio to 128kbps bitrate (which slightly reduced the overall filesize for me) and in under 10 minutes that will produce an (OpenDML) AVI that should play on youir stand-alone no problemo! :))

That approach should sort out whatever problem you've encountered too, wleaftx, unless you just got a corrupted file downloaded.

Never mind pissin' about with Nero burning it to DVD: that's just a waste of one's life! lol."
