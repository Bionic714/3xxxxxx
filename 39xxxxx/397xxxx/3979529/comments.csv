,Animal123456,2008-12-07T09:20Z,"I need help.  I download the torrent but when I try to put in the serial number, email and name.  I get an error saying something about case sensitive.  I copied and pasted all the info so I didnt do anything wrong.

Any solution to this problem?"
,FliedLice,2008-12-10T15:47Z,"@Animal123456 (and all others stuck)

I have Vista64 and the keygen was giving that error, using VMWare I booted Win98 and get the same error.  Using the keygen in this error state on the install is what causes this install problem.  I booted WinXP in VMWare and the keygen has no problems.  I then tested the install in Win98 and it accepts the keygen code.

I read earlier there was some issue regarding this app with some messenger software, that it corrupts it somehow.  So I made a fresh WinXP vmware install, with service pack 3, .NET 1&2 packages for the hell of it, made a backup of that for myself, then installed MSN 7.5 (with a fresh passport account for testing) and then finally AVVC 6.0.10.  It works, with no apparent adverse affects on MSN.  I should add that I was expecting much more from AVVC, thinking there were 'voices' I could pick from.  All of the changes I tried sound tinny or fake somehow.

But hey, its working.

,Asif_Freak,2009-05-13T17:56Z,awesome. works like charm
,Endolicious,2009-07-13T07:51Z,"I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here.
The program doesn't pick up my microphone when I say anything into it. My mic works with everything else that I can think of, like Ventrilo.

ScreamingBee's MorphVOX works fine, except lack of personalization.

Could somebody inform me as to what could be going wrong, please?"
,Borges80,2009-12-29T04:19Z,"I just tried it in call of duty mw2 and another game but even though my voice is morphed, everyone can still hear my normal voice on the other end. Why is this?"
