,iphone_liberator,2008-01-13T19:20Z,"The funny thing is, you would know that this will not screw up your iPhone if you actually try it out! Just take the files in the zip, SSH into your iPhone (Using WinSCP), and put the files in /Applications/Preferences.app/ It is quite annoying to be flamed for helping people"
,iphone_liberator,2008-01-13T19:21Z,I have seen throughout the day that quite a few people have downloaded this. Can anyone that actually downloaded and used this post a comment telling people the legitimacy of this?
,iphone_liberator,2008-01-14T04:30Z,"this torrent is now dead, see my new updated one"
