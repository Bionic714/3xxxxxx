I forgot how much I loved this film!, 5 July 2004
Author: sl_1999 from Limerick, Ireland 

I saw this film on Channel 4 recently (for those of you who don't know, Channel 4 is a British T.V station). It brought back a load of memories for me as I loved this film when I was younger. I could recall all the things I loved about this film: the talking dog (I think it was a dog anyway), a giant snail and the big bad wolf. I didn't understand what the film was about back then and after seeing it recently, I still am confused!
The visual effects are quite impressive for the films' time (who would have thought they had such marvelous effects 20 years ago)! I haven't seen Neverending Story 2 & 3 yet because I've heard they're kinda rubbish but I am considering giving them a bit of a peak. One last thing...why is the title in German? 


BE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS

ENJOY!
