,libbydude31,2008-02-16T19:07Z,I have not been able to get any sound when playing this file. I updated to the most recent k-lite pack and installed ac3filter 1.4.6. Any suggestions?
,cashsimpson,2008-02-18T19:08Z,theres no sound...dont download!!
,corrosion,2008-03-05T05:41Z,the film was made in Germany. The Book also. Thats because there is the german titel : die unendliche Geschichte. The Book is way better than the film. But true for the time it was made and as German production still amazing watching stuff. Fantasia is neverending...
,jon1969,2008-03-06T16:22Z,"this video is a 1 ,i used convert to dvd and had no probs with picture or sound 10/10 "
,HippieMAD,2008-03-15T19:23Z,FFS lern to place it in the right Category. This is't HiRes
,st_judas,2008-03-17T02:36Z,"WRONG category, this is not hi-res by any stretch.   l also had problems with the audio being out of sync."
,philsella,2008-03-27T15:42Z,"Thanks, I watched it with power dvd good quality video and good sound no problems here.....my son loved it as I did when I was 5."
,pc39707,2008-04-04T20:35Z,Should be called Neverending Boring.
,xiIix,2008-04-15T05:10Z,"Holy shit, the quality of this rip is fantastic. Though it isn't really HD, I'd say keep it in this section simply for it's importance. You'll never find this movie in a better quality rip unless you go DVDR, which I've never seen for this movie."
,T4rz4n,2008-04-21T18:29Z,"This isn't High-res! It should be 1280x720
(720 could be smaller depending on the aspect ratio of the video)

Am i not right?"
,xiIix,2008-04-30T14:42Z,"Yeah you're right, but this movie is never released in quality this good. It might not be HD but it's better than any other rip of this movie out there."

,nitsua1,2008-08-05T01:48Z,"The book is my favorite book i've ever read. I've scoured many sites looking for the E-book, preferentially in pdf. I've never found it in any format. Does anyone out there have it for posting? I would love it if you did. Great movie, but it's just so hard to do the book justice. In the meantime, I'll download the movie. THX!"
,Alfwine,2008-11-20T18:44Z,"If you are having problems getting the sound to work you need to download the AC3 audio codec and install it. You can find it at
