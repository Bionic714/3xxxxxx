,mon06,2008-01-15T02:28Z,"isn't this kinda small?
"
,LamasLikeToast,2008-01-17T02:26Z,"I don't think so. It's zipped (best, not fastest) and all of the OOT roms I've seen are around this size.

If you have any problems, just ask silly bitch."
,superiorfirepower,2008-02-05T17:28Z,"great, funny, cuz I never got the chance to play either ocarina of time OR majoras mask.

Thanx dude :)"
,craigc2006,2008-03-30T05:03Z,I extracted the file to desktop now I cant delete it whats up
,JoshM22,2008-04-01T06:18Z,What would be the best controller to use for this. A store bought game pad or a official Nintendo controller? I.e Classic Wii controller? 
,Enoh,2008-04-12T17:27Z,"thanks for putting this up! i needed the 1.0 verson ROM to test out gamesharks, it worked perfect=) I'll seed this one for a while!"
,LamasLikeToast,2008-04-16T05:55Z,"No problem to all the people who thanked me for it.

To the guy who couldn't delete it from his computer, I don't know what the problem is. Your computer probably just thinks the file is in use."
,FlurreH,2008-05-03T17:03Z,do u open this in P64?
,LamasLikeToast,2008-05-08T21:38Z,"yeah you open it in project 64

,Turdmuffin,2008-05-17T23:46Z,"What's wrong? I see the opening scene, click on the file, write the name in, no letters pop up and i click end and the game doesn't start...?"
,Turdmuffin,2008-05-18T00:00Z,"NVM GOT IT, X IS LIKE ENTER. WOOT THANKS ALOT MAN!"
,FlurreH,2008-05-21T22:15Z,it's a N64 file so its kinda small but it works Great!
,LamasLikeToast,2008-06-04T17:08Z,"no problem, thanks for all the compliments.

the only think i ask for in return is that you guys seed this torrent and keep it alive :]"
,pLAYBACK1984,2008-06-19T04:45Z,"This works great, thanks Lamas. The reason it is small is probably because of the ""primitive"" (relatively speaking) models/textures. Everything works well, no problems and no viruses/malware/etc. Just make sure to save using the emulator and not the actual game, because I used the latter and always loaded up at Link's house in the elf place :P "
,link9898,2008-06-23T06:21Z,"yes the 1.0 version

,assasin747,2008-08-08T04:43Z,this is weird it doesnt let you play it sais u need a controller
,assasin747,2008-08-08T05:49Z,k how do you save
,LamasLikeToast,2008-09-16T06:29Z,"Not sure how to save, because I don't know what program you have running.

But the controller thing, just try a different plug in until you find one thats compatible for the game and emulator.

Thanks for all the positive feed back and please continue to seed :D"
,FLuX253,2009-01-04T06:20Z,"2 things, video wont play right, and were can i get a controller? help plz"
