He seemed like such a nice guy.. He pretty much kept to himself...

Bob Maconel is about to have a very bad day...

Stop whining about aXXo. He is gone, replaced by others and soon forgotten."

I will never forget aXXo ever!!!"
,Monkehtron,2008-01-16T04:13Z,"If you can't play this on your xbox360/ps3 then re-encode the video using total video converter or something.

Don't expect the format to change to something stupid when the majority use their computers/dvd players.

As for aXXo, whatever happened to a rose by any other name would smell as sweet?"
,adielrock9,2008-01-16T11:55Z,"I'm new and need help.  The video plays fine in my Windows Media Player, but there's no audio.  What are some possible problems/solutions?  Thanks."
,king006,2008-01-16T19:02Z,hey ablerock try downloading klite codec pack and window media player classic that should do..

,RedBishop,2008-01-17T00:41Z,"Very nice work FXG (team?) Very nice releases top notch quality. 
Only hiccup for me is i cant play them on the ps3 like i did with Axxo releases (therefore no nice divx/xvid on the big screen). Guy gotta ask  ;) 
Keep up the good work "
,Monkehtron,2008-01-17T13:07Z,"Why would you use a private proxy? :/ They just send a letter to whoever hosts the proxy server asking for your real IP.

Why not use an ipfilter and something like protowall. or just use Tor..."

,jahriichie1124,2008-01-18T00:21Z,"Movie is great quality, but TERRIBLE.  It fails to be dark funny.  It's too long.  I challenge anyone to watch this and after not regret it."
,TantalosTantalos,2008-01-18T02:09Z,probably one of slaters best movies ever!

,RandyMoss81,2008-01-19T19:01Z,"Excellent quality movie, but not worth watching.  Should have taken the advice of some of the other comments and skipped this flick."
,Wybe,2008-01-22T23:55Z,"jahriichie1124, challenge accepted and I quite enjoyed the movie. good quality, and a good movie for someone who has the patience and dare to enjoy something that's not only tits and guns."

Peace

So fucking sad."
,theromman,2009-05-15T05:11Z,It's nice to see people actually leaving legit comments on a movie. It is a good movie. Anyone who can appreciate a good film....will enjoy it. 
,metalikod,2009-05-26T20:08Z,"it's a good movie
it makes it good cause Elisha Cuthbert shows tits ^_^"
,cenonmma,2010-03-22T04:16Z,people please seed! thanks.
,Jack_Raiden,2010-06-16T17:33Z,"Typical FXG quality, below-average with small file size as highest priority. Decent but tiny video resolution (580x240, 186K pixels). Decent but somewhat wasteful CBR, 48Khz audio. 7/10"
,skeelol,2011-06-12T20:28Z,"A) Please don't be dumb enough to trust people writing ""reviews"" on TPB. Just look at the top seeded movies...always kiddee action crap with a horrible IMDB rating. I'd be surprised if any of the negative comments above came from anyone over the age of 15. Just because yer dumb and don't understand the movie doesn't mean it sucks. 
B) It is a good movie but requires some understanding, theres a great explanation/ summary on IMDB.
C) Not Elisha Cuthbert's tits. It's common movie knowledge that no face with tits = body double."
,Amaponian,2012-07-16T19:44Z,"A really good movie.

""There comes a time when the diseased and the weak must be sacrificed in order to save the herd""

Video: Good
Audio: Good
Movie: Excellent"
