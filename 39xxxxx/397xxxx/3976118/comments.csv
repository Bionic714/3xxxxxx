,Andezze,2008-01-30T21:07Z,Thanks man.
,andriyko,2008-02-03T20:37Z,Great videos
,jacobburke,2008-02-05T04:48Z,Can anyone recommend where to get subtitles that actually give a translation to English and not just show that people are speaking another language.  The subtitle site recommended seems more like closed captioning for a tv show than the subtitles shown in the movies.  Thanks!
,kidjete,2008-02-11T02:06Z,Anyone had this problem before?  I downloaded the torrent and had the 3 avi files.  The files sizes were all around 700mb but the file on disk was a little over 200mb.  I couldn't play any of the files and I have all the codecs updated and tried all my video players.  I'm going to go ahead and try to download the the movies again and see if I just had bad files.  Anyone know what might have caused this?
,drpower,2008-02-11T06:05Z,"Thank-you, this is excellent quality."
,tonsilromancer,2008-03-08T20:04Z,"That subtitle site seems a bit chatty and weird.  How can you tell whether the subtitles are closed captioning, or translation to english?"
,mikey32187,2008-03-14T23:57Z,Hey Kidjete download vlc player that will solve your problem
,tony70516,2008-03-15T18:18Z,can someone please help me out! it was oin good and when i hit 33% it dropped from 180kb/s to 25kb/s  someone please help me! idk why im getting such crappy speeds. thanks

great quality,great films"
,Harry Q Hammer,2008-03-25T19:06Z,"Hey shareboy,

I can assure you that, if the encoder knows what he is doing, 2.06GB is more than enough for ""All 3 movies, excellent quality""!

I tried listening to these books on tape, BORING! I listen to a LOT of books on tape and the person reading was SO BORING they put me to sleep every time i tried listening to them! But the movies are excellent.

thanks a lot!"
,maggsayy,2008-08-12T22:31Z,"check out my bourne trilogy, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4338498/The_Bourne_Trilogy_For_iPod_(Mp4.)_All_HDDVDRips they're converted from the hd dvds into small 800mbishh mp4 movies. :D"
,Newb787,2008-09-06T00:34Z,"Clarity is excellent; however, the brightness/balance is waaaaay too dark.  Looks like something happened during the conversion process to XVID.  I dont think my LCD tv can handle the lack of brightness in this rip.  WMP has to have the brightness way up there."
,lipex,2008-10-05T21:41Z,plz SEED

,wes5656,2010-05-16T02:17Z,any subtitles for this movie??? Please let me know
,Balu.1994,2010-07-22T02:31Z,"How can i upload faster?
i havent touched the settings and i download with (depending on the torrent) up to 600 KB/s.
but my uploadspeed is quite slow, about 0-45 KBs or something like that. how can i change that? is it my internet or wrong settings? i really dont want to be an leecher-asshole who doesnt upload. "
,IamDUFF,2010-10-04T07:11Z,"Balu, it has to do with your internet service and router, mainly service though.
I feel kinda bad too, i can dl up to i mb/s but my uTorrent recommended max for upping is ~60 kb/s =(
Love the movies though. I think i'd like the books better but it's still 9.5/10 with me."
,nautica002,2010-11-09T21:57Z,3 movies.. about 700mb each. very clear but a little dark. before burning to dvd may want  to increase brightness and contrast. 
,jamesaxe,2010-12-22T09:12Z,Fuck you. There are no subtitles you dick
,peewee-hermen,2010-12-29T17:12Z,"you no wut i hate ...al those god damn dumb asses who get pissed if the torrents aren't to their liking...fuck you you shit heads..just be thankful for the torrents that people like naxo are uploading for yor cheap lazy asss to be able to download for free while they are putting their asses on the line just so you dont have to go out and buy the actual movie/song/game or program.......ill say it again..fuck you, ungrateful piece of shit if you don't like it then just stop downloading from this site and go out any fuckin buy the god damn fucking movies, mp3's and programs.......

naxo you are amazing and thanks for the upload"
,Stozzy,2011-01-25T14:44Z,"my only deal w/ 90% of torrents i pop from here is that the movies that have hardcoded subs that are supposed to be there that give important key dialogue, are not there. I for one don't speak every language out there, especially alien ones... quality is great, but may swap this trilogy out for hardcoded singles. nice up, but lack of foreign->english killed it for me."
,TorrentJezuz,2011-06-19T15:01Z,Dont listen to those morons this is a good torrent and downloads pretty fast. Im downloading 300kb/s and higher.Its not naxosking internet its cause your a bunch of retards with shit internet. Thanks for the upload naxosking.
,TorrentJezuz,2011-06-20T06:51Z,"@Newb787
You must be a newb or and idiot because there is nothing wrong with the brightness/balance on any of the movies. "
,TorrentJezuz,2011-06-20T06:55Z,"@camellight
What are you going on about.
1 is 700MB 2 is 705MB & 3 is 701MB = 2.6GB so what are you going on about with 2.1GB its 2.6 get your facts right before commenting you idiot"
,rdgtrg,2011-07-07T08:47Z,seed please !
,Metal4ever88,2011-08-03T18:56Z,I agree with those saying that these movies need those translated English subtitles.  I don't know where to find them.  I clicked on that link to that Open Subtitles site but didn't find anything specific other than English subtitles.
,apocryphal_theses,2011-08-27T21:34Z,"It's unbelievable that this needs to be explained.

3 movies given by 700 MB, 701 MB and 705 MB, respectively.  Add them gives 2, 106 MB. Divide by 1024 gives 2.056640625 GB = 2.06 GB. It's fucking elementary maths. The stated torrent size is correct."
,plasma_mf,2011-08-27T23:57Z,its basic maths shit
,GoLoboGo,2012-05-20T15:34Z,"Why would you need English subs for an English-speaking movie? What are you deaf or something? 

Thanks naxosking "
,Latinaso,2012-07-21T23:48Z,@GoLoboGo... some people ARE deaf... idiot
,stinki,2012-08-22T14:38Z,"Golobogo is deaf or stupid, there are at least 4 different languages spoken in this movie (english, french, german, swiss IN THE FIRST 20 MINUTES). This is crippled/useless without subs, especially as the files were renamed so we have no idea where they were sourced from, making subs annoying to match. somebody posting links to specific correct subs would be appreciated"
,notatarix,2012-08-24T22:14Z,"For the subtitle, the version it works with each of the movies is DvDrip AC3[Eng]-FXG."
