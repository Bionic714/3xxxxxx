"What Almereyda sees in Eggleston's work are the things that seem to drive Almereyda's films: life as a continual paradox. In Almereyda's vampire film Nadja, the dead travel fast, and the ancient and the modern exist side-by-side in his Hamlet. As Almereyda speaks about Eggleston's photographs, he discusses the work as "hiding in plain sight," "familiar and strange, recognizable and indelible," "a part of a thing can reflect a whole, a wider truth," "an unbalanced emotion between fear and love" It's a personal, revealing take on Eggleston. Almereyda shows the distance between spectator and subject during a climactic interview with Eggleston where the filmmaker asks the artist to discuss the work in terms of a paradox. The artist shakes his head, perhaps annoyed, muttering, "That doesn't make any sense to me."  - Jeremiah Kipp, Slant Magazine
