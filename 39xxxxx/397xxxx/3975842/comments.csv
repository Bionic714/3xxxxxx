,TheAmishNazi,2008-12-29T04:35Z,"Thanks to nocarrier2 for this up.

Due to the use of Nero Recode when transcoding from the original NTSC DVD to a MP4 file, it's quite difficult to transcode this MP4 to anything else.

So that I can play this documentary on my set top DVD player with my TV, I created a successful XviD avi of this MP4 by converting it with ""AllToAVI"".

To rriemann,
Check out the Robert Frank documentary ""Fire in the East: A Portrait of Robert Frank"" here:

,nocarrier2,2009-01-14T22:38Z,Thanks for the info.  I have stopped using Nero Recode and started using StaxRip which creates much more compatible movies.
