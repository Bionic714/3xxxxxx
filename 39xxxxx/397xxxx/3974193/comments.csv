,dmsuperman,2008-04-01T05:24Z,"Blech, why would you include St. Anger? I would consider it not Metallica, but more the result of a possession of the band by evil spirits.

Other than that, wonderful!"
,olegnep,2008-04-05T17:00Z,"awesome , i will seed on an oc3 line as often as i can (currently uploading at 1.4 MiB )"

,Panteeera,2008-07-01T21:37Z,Legendary torrent. 
,piratailin,2008-07-07T01:17Z,Many people need to reconfigure their torrent client to upload to a limited number of peers at once. If you set it to upload to unlimited number of peers then your're splitting your bandwith into tiny little portions. Right now I'm uploading this torrent to five peers faster than I'm downloading from fifty seeders.

,jakefloyd,2008-07-10T02:09Z,"Metallica began as frontiers and rebels of the music industry and now they are just old farts against the new music revolution. Never purchase another album of theirs, but download all you want!"

,moonlitnchangin,2008-08-09T23:21Z,"BESTinTEXAS thanks forever for the effort and your contribution to society;

jakefloyd hit the nail on the head and it happens to be one of the few remaining in metallica's once legendary sarcohpagus.

musike you are a FUCKING SPAMMER and should be shot on site.  There are actually some people who post worthwhile suggestions on relative torrents; you eviscerate and condemn whatever dignity you never had."
,radicmc,2008-08-10T03:11Z,thanx for all the songs except the soundtrack ones
,perfectforever,2008-08-11T12:28Z,"Help!!!! New at this, downloaded file but when I play the songs they skip to the next one in the middle like an ""intro"" file....any ideas? and BTW...Great work!! once I can listen to it...
(blonde and female) ;=) "
,Panteeera,2008-08-12T23:53Z,"perfectforever, are you sure you haven't turned on shuffle?"
,Et_Vaan_Osaa,2008-08-13T14:23Z,"perfectforever is the whole torrent completed? Eventhough you download the torrent file itself, it does not mean all the files are completed. What does your torrentclient say?  

Also check your audio player, check if ""intro"" has been selected. Then it will only play a short portion of the songs, before skipping to next."

Garage Days - Re-Revisited is an EP which I normally do not include, and Live Shit - Binge and Purge is a live album which I sometimes and sometimes do not include... I guess I did all studio albums this time (donno why). I would delete and reupload but way too many seeders at this point...

@Dr@g0nz731, lol. next time... do a bit of research :) HeD-Stone covered it."

,DeMoN_SLO,2009-01-17T14:04Z,"@ wontgetfooledagain1

FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, an audio format similar to MP3, but lossless, meaning that audio is compressed in FLAC without any loss in quality.

BUT: if we have .mp3 its sensless to convert it to flac."
