A tiny dinosaur with a feisty attitude marches across the wilderness defending the friendly and furry from the mean and hungry. Told entirely without words, the stories highlight the amazingly detailed art and visual storytelling genius of creator Masashi Tanaka. An instant sensation in Japan where these comics adventures first appeared., Gon is being reprinted in America for the first time.
