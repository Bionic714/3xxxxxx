World Of Friends Synopsis
How exciting! ItÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½A Trip To Pearis, France,Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ where Strawberry makes fast friends with Crepes Suzette and her poodle, Eclaire. But when Pupcake and Eclaire get lost, Crepes and Strawberry must work together to find them. And Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½The Great Friendship Festival,Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ is terrific fun, even though Angel CakeÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s baking disaster teaches her that she needs to ask for help sometimes, just as Strawberry and her new pal Tea Blossom realize that friends donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t have to like all the same things to get along.
