,Raethe,2008-03-28T06:43Z,"Wow I only ever had the demo for this game back in the day....still played the shit out of it.  I'll definitely seed as often as I can.

Thanks for the upload it's such a rare game to find!!!"
,musingmumbler,2008-04-21T00:26Z,"Wow, this game really brings back some memories. 

Can this file be played on a computer or  burnt to a disk and played on my old playstation?

I don't have a psp. . . :-("
,mistersquirrle,2008-06-01T01:42Z,"Yeah, this can be played on the computer using an emulator like:
ePSXe http://www.epsxe.com/download.php
just download and install and when you run the program go File -> Run ISO and browse to EinHander.bin and play :)"
,AnimeJay87,2008-12-06T05:24Z,At first i loaded the file with epsxe but it had an error saying unable to load. I    figured it might have been corrupt but i noticed the files name was in German Einhnder.bin/cue just rename the file to Einhander!! I'll be seeding for awhile since i've always wanted to play this game. Thats goes for every fan of side scrollers!
