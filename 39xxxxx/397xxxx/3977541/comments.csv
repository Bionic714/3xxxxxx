,fs88,2008-01-25T11:13Z,great movie. just because you have to think about the plot instead of having it laid out in front of you doesnt make it a bad movie.

,equazcion,2008-02-04T07:12Z,"Remember to vote good quality torrents up, via the ""+"" links up top. People who want to sabotage the site are voting everything down. FXG's torrents should have high ratings but they're all in the negatives right now 'cause of this. "

,timothy.price,2008-05-06T03:29Z,"If I download with Limewire, am I stuck with only seeders who are logged into the Gnutella network? This website lists 169 seeders and I have 0 hosts available on Limewire. This does little in the way of making me feel less sick."
,timothy.price,2008-05-07T05:53Z,"The two of them start talking about whether or not Van Patten can get to Kaktus by nine and I've stopped concentrating on the voices coming through the cordless phone and started watching instead, with growing interest, the rat I've bought ? I still have the mutant one that emerged from the toilet ? in its new glass cage, heave what's left of its acid ridden body halfway across the elaborate Habitrail system that sits on the kitchen table, where it attempts to drink from the water holder that I filled with poisoned Evian this morning. The scene seems too pitiful to me or not pitiful enough. I can't decide. A call waiting noise takes me out of my mindless delirium and I tell Van Patten and McDermott to please hold."
,PHRogsKWiJj,2008-05-15T03:36Z,"do yourself a favor people...drop a tab,spark a phat one one,watch this movie and enjoy..all the negative comments are from people who should be watching ""fresh prince"" re-runs and asking thier mum what time they gotta be in..remember...buy the ticket...take the ride..phrogskwijj 2k8"
,Mr.Pilkington,2008-05-15T10:13Z,Drop some acid sit back and enjoy

I STRONGLY RECOMMEND this film.
