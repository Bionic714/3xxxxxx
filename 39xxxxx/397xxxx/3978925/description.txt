This is an insane indoctrination video with famous actor and nutcase Tom Cruise babbling on about the greatness of Scientology.

Since the Church of Scientology keeps pulling this video off of every site it appears on.. TRY TO PULL IT FROM THIS SITE FUCKERS!!

Btw, if scientology is supposed to save the world or something, why do they want their "promotion" video deleted everywhere?
