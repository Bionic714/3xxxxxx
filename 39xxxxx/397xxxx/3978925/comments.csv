,WagTheDog,2008-01-16T19:25Z,"What bothers me most is that his selfrighteousness is just like any other kind of agressive religious fundamentalist. They (Scientology) even tried to drag in Elvis into the crap, but he gave them ""the finger"" litteraly! Now his daughter Lisa Marie and former divorced wife Priscilla  are members. Elvis even put in a clause in the divorce paper with her not to use his name (Presley) But she still calls herself Presley, and Scientology cash in millions on that name. Elvis may not be ""Rocking"" today, but I bet he is ""Rolling"" in his grave!"

Youtube are such pussies for giving in to those fuckers at Scientology and taking down all the vids.  Even XenuTV just got banned!

,Fooljeff,2009-02-17T21:02Z,Not any more insane than anyone else smoking religion.
,tdieppa,2009-02-18T00:34Z,"The difference between this and a legitimate religion is that this requires you to give money to advance.  I could go to my church every week and never pay a dime if I wanted to, there's no obligation or anything.. this is why indulgences in the 16th century were so wrong, they basically said if you don't pay your ancestors will stay in purgatory/hell etc.  

Just don't bash real religions that give people a moral code to live by and expect decency out of people.  Yes every religion has sickos and perverts and corruption in them because they are large human institutions and humans aren't perfect.  But big religions don't compare to cults like scientology that sell salvation."

,phamalda,2009-02-18T14:24Z,"I will agree that Scientology is quite bazaar from our perspective knowing Christianity to include Catholicism, Mormonism, Muslim, Judaism, etc. as the accepted religions. But how is Scientology different from any of these others. 

From 50k feet, don't they all believe in some unseen higher power? Aren't all of the fundamental, pillars, values, etc. based on some fictitious book or books written by a human or group of humans? Yep, Scientologists are weird but so are Christians. Before you begin flaming, I am a recovering Baptist...born again and all of that crap."

Is it possible that someone made a foul edit of the actual video to discredit him as insane? How could he go on talking like that and not making any sense at all? 
,10Base-T,2009-02-18T14:54Z,"All religions are cults... or once were considered as much.  When Christianity came along, it was laughed at - that was, until Christians started (mass)murdering anyone who didn't join them, and desecrating thousands of years of previous culture to further their campaigns.

Scientology may seem to be among the worst cults simply because it is a blatant wealth-accumulation scam, but the Vatican is it's own bloody city, virtually paved with gold!

I believe that everybody should be entitled to believe what they will.  I believe that people have a right to stupidity and ignorance.

What I don't believe is that anybody in the upper ranks of the Scientologist cult actually believes the shit they peddle.  I don't believe the founders of most religions really held the strength of their convictions over the accumulation of power and wealth, and the sway of human minds and society.

I truly and utterly believe that so long as 'organised religion' persists in the indoctrination of simpletons, we will never attain true enlightenment as a race.

As for Scientology's poster-boy, I've long been convinced that Cruise will only keep getting wackier if he never comes out of the closet."
