,Darth Seaweed,2008-01-29T00:58Z,where is the exe. file???
,Mordanthanus,2008-01-29T03:49Z,"I already had the DirectX files on my machine from working with another anime game...

,MazterMind,2008-02-06T08:28Z,Says the file is corrupt. Any ideas?
,nicolas1983gr,2008-02-08T15:48Z,"i install the game easily, i run it, so far great, but then after a few dialogues it throws me out. my computer is powerful so my graphics are not the problem"
,gnominov,2008-02-14T09:00Z,"help me, it says i doesn't have a japaneese OS :/.
Anyway to fix that?"
,kraues,2008-02-16T02:20Z,"Vista refused to even open the app.

No good."
,Krsar1,2008-02-18T19:31Z,"gnominov. you need to put the file to the right directory on your pc. that directory is C:\program files\
here you unrar the file. and after this i soud work if not remove a ""manifest"" file.
the final directory will be:
C:\program files\illusion\sexybeach 3"
,reaper07,2008-02-22T16:45Z,"When I try to start, it just says ""Please Insert Sexy Beach 3 DISC !!""

Any ideas?"
,Krsar1,2008-02-22T18:40Z,use the reg tool if you haven't alredy
,reaper07,2008-02-23T20:08Z,"I can't find any regtool for a non-cd crack.
Can anyone link to a torrent with the tool? "
,Krsar1,2008-02-28T18:17Z,this verson of the game doesn't need a cd to begin whit. and the regtool apers when you unpack the rar file
,evilcrazer,2008-02-28T19:22Z,"Running it from d drive instead of C and named it what i wanted. You dont have to really make sure that game has to be in c:\program files\illusion etc. All you need to do is to make sure that you have dotnet 2.0 and directx9 installled on ur system and you can put the game anywhere or any harddrive you want. Reinstalling directx9 and dotnet will take care of most problems and after that install the game in what ever drive or folder you want.
Cheers"
,evilcrazer,2008-02-28T19:24Z,zakimar i had the dll missing problem. just installed directx9 and it cured it.
,Celexa,2008-03-06T13:03Z,"Wow, simply amazing, thank you :)"
,clstirens,2008-03-25T20:13Z,"Ok
I don't think that this is the torrent, or the author's fault.  Just crappy Vista syndrome.

Try running the game as Administer (right click)
and make sure to go and get the latest version of Direct X from M$."
,Mickey_TK421,2008-03-29T17:36Z,"Sound only w/ black screen vista fix!!!

For the vista users: first off whats causing the sound only and black screen is the opening credits video. this causes the screen to lock up, this is how i solved my problem.

How to fix it: go to the program file, open it. go into the data folder look for video file: sb3_0001. delete it (move it to a junk folder or something just in case) start launcher and POW, your done!

(note) an error window claiming MIA file will pop up before game runs, ignore it, click ""ok"" and game will run flawlessly. enjoy vista fans!!!"
,foxter1907,2008-04-05T17:35Z,great man it works tnx nice job
,khmeraura,2008-04-09T23:19Z,"I managed to get a trojan from this torrent... little bugger was hard to get rid of too. In any case, be careful. It messed with the registry and explorer."

,humourbash,2008-04-28T01:37Z,To anyone running VISTA you can play games if it is only for XP or older by changing the setting by right clck on the game exe i do not know what things but look in properties of that game exe. you will see settings to change to XP or such.
,BlFoi,2008-05-07T13:46Z,After the initial dialogs when I click on a location the game crashes. I have installed the latest dx9 but still the problem remains. I have XP. Any help?

,puck1279,2008-05-27T09:28Z,"Initially, you might have a few glitches here and there. Can't really explain them, it works fine for me now aside from not being able to save my progress.

No viruses, no spyware... good job by that guy"
,stefman666,2008-06-02T23:42Z,"If anyone wants to know how to save, go to the data folder of the game and make a new file titled ""Save"". The game will do the rest."
,stefman666,2008-06-02T23:43Z,It has to be a folder.
,calexsun,2008-06-27T20:22Z,"I just downloaded this, and when I open it, theres 31 dofferent parts... And then at the bottom theres a .sfv file.

,Ingvert,2008-11-24T20:47Z,"Great torrent, only that SB3 plus crashes instantly, regardless of compatibility settings before the application even starts.

So much for ""easy install"" and ""no glitches""."
,inAcrysis,2008-12-05T15:55Z,"To all the idiots posting stupid ""it won't work"" comments,
Please donate your pc to your local school.
Maybe the children know how to use it properly?

As for this torrent:-

It does exactly what it says on the tin.
Just un-rar, install & play!!!
Works 100% efficiently.
So, thanks to zealousrage.
The game is SO good, funny, sexy and when you get one of the girls to suck your dick til it cums & you get to choose whether she swallows or spits it out & rubs it on her tits - well it's certainly different type of game than any other I've played!!!
Thanks again to the uploader."
,inAcrysis,2008-12-05T16:02Z,"Also, the comments on using rar files.
It is a good job it is done with rar files.
Torrent 1.4Gb ---- un-rar it ---- it's now just under 4Gb.
Or would you rather download the full 4Gb?"

,Fireholder,2009-10-28T14:55Z,"Foreveralone, you're a moron.
You post telling people to seed, then the next day whine about people whining about seeders.
Hypocrite...
Furthermore, with torrenting, you are SHARING AT THE SAME TIME YOU ARE DOWNLOADING... you DO NOT have to download the entire contents of the torrent in order to share what you already have...
Do you feel foolish?"

,1.3.2.5,2010-02-20T20:29Z,"Lol. If you're getting less than 250kb/s with a cable connection, then you should check your ports. 
www.canyouseeme.org Âľtorrent uses ports 6881-6999. 
If the site cant see you, you need to portfoward:
1. run/firewall.cpl, add port (add both TCP, UDP)
2. check www.portfoward.com
3. Apply the instructions
4. If theres nothing happening, check your router. If you're in a community LAN system you should talk to your network admin, but its probably best if you get your very own network connection."
