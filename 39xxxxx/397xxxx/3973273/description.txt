That's right.  The first boot I ever heard, courtesy of Ritchie Maenpaa, who B&Ped it to me waaaaay back in 1998 when I first joined - TimD NEVER forgets a kindness done him.  August 31, 1969 is a red-letter date in the history of Led Zeppelin.  On this date, the group played the Texas International Pop Festival with a number of other groups.  If I'm not mistaken, the band was allotted 30 minutes.  As you'll see, the running time is far greater than that - one of the highlights of the show is the twentyish-minute version of How Many More Times, during which you can hear the promoters on the PA system begging the band to wrap it up.  The band predictably ignores the promoters and plays Communication Breakdown anyway to close the show.  

Having gotten this show so long ago, some of the specifics elude me - I'm pretty sure it's rated a SB-10, but there's enough audience captured to give the show a lot of atmosphere, and it's one of those shows that makes me wonder if maybe Jimmy isn't the one who leaked a lot of the soundboards over the years - it's nearly professional in quality and balance and almost sounds mixed.  The performance is scorching - truly top-notch playing all around, and the instrument balance is excellent.  Robert is in excellent voice.  I Can't Quit You Baby is probably the hottest version I've ever heard - the solo is devastating.  This recording ruined me on bootlegs for a long time - very little measures up to the quality of performance or the sound quality of Don't Mess With Texas.
