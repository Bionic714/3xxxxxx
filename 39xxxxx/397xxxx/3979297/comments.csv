Instructions would be nice."

1. Mount Iso With daemon tools. whatever you prefer.

3. After it is done installing run both patches.
4. After you run the patches run the game

You have to download Daemon tools (search on google) then you can open the game WITH the daemon tools. Just install and play. 
Hope this helped!"
