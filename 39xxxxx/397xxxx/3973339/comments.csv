,hockpooh,2008-01-12T06:48Z,"Actually this is ok. I just don't like it when everytime I quit word an alert window pops up as if it crash/quit.

As for waiting for the final release on the 15th, I'm not holding my breath, remember we're talking about MicroSoft. Most likely it will be 2010 before the 2008 comes out. They really don't care about Mac users and only do what they have to, to get the growing number of Mac switchers to play nice with Windows."
,emla2bu7a5,2008-01-12T07:08Z,to the user above me (hockpooh?): Office 2008 is available for pre-order since about a week now. i would worry more about product update etc. if you have installed any recent Adobe product you would know what kind of nightmare it is.
[T],Apokarteron,2008-01-12T11:09Z,The final is coming on the 15th of January...
,scunky,2008-01-12T12:03Z,"15th sounds right, steve Jobs to give a keynote speech on the 15th.......lots of new toys to be released.....cant wait!"
,lasker76,2008-01-12T13:18Z,who the fuck care about the old office 2008 beta? the real deal will coming in three days and hit the torrent sites soon after that date.
,balahir,2008-01-12T14:22Z,"Is this the same beta that was on Pirate Bay earlier this fall, or a more recent? For some reason, I can't find the other one..."
,RyanThaDude,2008-01-12T22:42Z,"I'm pretty sure it's the same beta as before. Excel is sorta usable, Word constantly crashes. Better to wait for the gold."
,miloude,2008-01-13T01:14Z,"I try this befor 1 month... after install he said your copy has expired !!!!

boys wait for the real one @"
,maniaco007,2008-01-13T05:16Z,"This is the second copy of the Beta version of Office 2008. I have been using it everyday for 2 months now, and have only had minor issues. Once you use the crack it won't complain about the expiration date.

I'm using both Word & Excel and am happy with them."
,horvatic@sbcglobal.net,2008-01-13T16:05Z,BETA EXPIRED! Don't bother downloading this crap!
,maniaco007,2008-01-13T19:51Z,"Dude, it's not because you're fucking stupid, that you have to spread it all around the fucking planet... if you download the crack that's available on Pirate Bay, then you won't have any date expiration problem... why would I post this if I couldn't use it... Man you're too thick... In the meantime instead of posting shithead comments like these, why don't you upload some stuff, instead of downloading like an asshole, participate and we'll like you better.

Here is the crack for the morons like you:

And don't forget to seed... although without any uploads I doubt you've been seeding anything."
,tomwans,2008-01-14T22:49Z,im surprised there isn't a copy of the gold master here already (1 day before release)
,augusto.ivo,2008-01-15T12:36Z,No final version yet?

,bianco_mwg,2008-01-17T09:03Z,"thank you for this torrent

,zonkel,2008-01-17T19:36Z,"I have installed it on my Mac and its running, but it is also crashing all the time and I can?t save my preferences. No good."
,macwel99,2008-01-28T01:40Z,Don't download Beta! There is Final available!
