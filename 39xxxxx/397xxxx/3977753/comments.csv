,LbL,2008-01-19T20:56Z,"
How come that Episode 2 of the Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus, not at all is in German?

You must have confused the Titles!

Please check and see WHAT of the very many files that REALLY is Episode 2, and then tell me, Thanx!
"
[T],BESTinTEXAS,2008-01-20T07:07Z,"Or you could of just looked it up on Wikipedia and saw that it was shot entirely in English and dubbed in German. I don't have the dubbed version, tough luck. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python's_Fliegender_Zirkus#Episode_2_.28produced_in_1972.29"
,LbL,2008-01-20T08:19Z,"
Thanx for Enlighten us all!

But it ain't much 'use' of a German version that isn't IN German, or is there... :-)

Yhey could at least have Subtitled it in German, then.  :-)
"
[T],BESTinTEXAS,2008-01-21T03:15Z,"If you really want to, you could find the dubbed version or find the subs yourself. Honestly I wouldn't know how and or want to. Those two just happened to come with the download, so I included them with this re-upload. Sorry if it ain't perfect, but like I said, I just downloaded this, organized it a bit more than the original was, and resubmitted it.

1 episode that is just missing subs ain't bad imo."
,mitteget,2008-01-26T14:19Z,"Thanksalot, I've been looking for that 2nd ""German"" episode for ages, dubbed or not."

,Zappo_,2008-09-23T04:40Z,"I'll keep seeding this since nobody else have mentioned it, but there's some pulldown nastiness going on in the episodes (but not in the movies), which makes them judder on all the 4 players I've tried. It's most obvious during camera pan. If you can't see it, good for you."
,datrebor,2008-11-07T09:26Z,"Thank you very much, been looking for some of these  movies for a long time, will just let it seed."

,guiriloco,2009-01-25T12:33Z,"My brain huuuuurts! Right, fantastic, all the python stuff, great torrent, thanks. But with 136 seeders why don't I connect to them, maximum 1 or 2, usually only a couple of leechers... and  why is it crawling along at 0-2 Kbps??? All my other torrents are OK, just this one. At this rate it will take years to download! Anyone else having any difficulty? Any solution greatly appreciated. Now, where did I leave my Curry's brain?"
,Moe1andonly,2009-02-10T01:49Z,"It took just under 5 months to download, started September 28th 2008, and finished today February 9th 2009, but hell yeah!!!! it was worth the wait....

,guiriloco,2009-02-23T11:30Z,"Moe/mike- took 5 months, eh? Looks about right, it's been a little over a month and I'm on 25%... is it just coz of the shitty seed/leech ratio? (1 : 6.5) C'mon seeders! Oh well, patience, and thanks again."
