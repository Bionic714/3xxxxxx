Like the notes say, we realized very quickly trying to convert our own files for use in 'unathorized' players that very few people actually knew how to do it.

Which explained for me anyway why very few big books or new releases have torrents.

One caveat would be news groups where collectors have terra bites of books stored, and truth be told I'm pretty sure T for trespass and kite runner were emailed by people that got them from news groups, but newsgroups are pretty time consuming to navigate and I think even less audio book readers are up for that.

Anyway, I've had my eyes open for the Diamond Age for a while so cheers. The only suggestion I would make, and take it or leave it, is to lose the .rar.

It is an unnecessary step in most cases and prevents people from picking and choosing the files they want if they are only missing a few, or if they would like to prioritize the first track or two and give them a listen before downloading the whole torrent.

Any feedback you'd like to offer on the conversion instruction would be welcomed.

peace.

The original files were processed in a wrong order.

Thank you for the intention, anyway.

,ttransfer,2008-02-12T11:47Z,"ok - great to see this classic floating about in audio form, but with 16 files numbered wrongly and no audio cue at the start of each to help get them in the right order, it needs sorting...

Anyone know what order they're supposed to be in?"
,soundofmind,2008-03-08T08:58Z,"Whoa, sounds like that would be a bit of a pain to try to figure out the proper order.  Anyone who's done it care to share the right chapter order with us?  "
,tuab,2008-03-22T14:01Z,"I know where the start is, because I listened to this from start to finish, without putting it in the right order. I almost didn't notice ;)) 

Actual order:
START: Track 8, 63:57~ - end of Track 10, then start with track 1-track8"
,axel-berger,2009-10-13T22:34Z,"That not even the author's name was spelt correctly should have been a clue. On top of the wrong order the MP3-stream was hacked apart regardless producing clicks, it seems non-Dolby cassettes were played with a Dolby setting, and the format is very badly chosen. Reverse filtering the Dolby and correcting the order is still less effort that digitizing from scratch, but the margin is small and the quality still very bad. N.B: I do have the original cassettes, I just wanted to share the effort of conversion to a useful format."
,Catwood,2010-12-29T20:32Z,"Thanks to Tuab for giving me the starting point, I have taken this RAR file and parsed it into Chapters in the right order - a real pain, I might add. 

That resulted in 852 MB in 84 files.  There is about 10 seconds of bad sound scattered throughout the files.  I did not try to repair the sound as each is about a second long.  Other than that, I did not find the quality bad...

If there is an interest, leave a note here and I'll do a torrent.  It will be slow as long as I am the only seeder -- my upload speed is very slow.

Regards,  Cat"
