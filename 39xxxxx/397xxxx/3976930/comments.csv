,aircamboy,2008-01-14T19:48Z,A general question: why don't you leave subtitles on the original language of the film? It would be nice for non-Swe/Nor/Dan/Fin speakers... and for cinema lovers
[T],wormman,2008-01-14T19:56Z,This is a retail disc with only nordic subtitle on it. I never take away any subtitle when I make a torrent.
