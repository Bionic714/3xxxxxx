Don't get me wrong though, I greatly appreciate the upload.  Thanks so much!  My friend went to UCSC and recommended this band.  

I love the self titled album."

Slightly Stoopid is an American band based in Ocean Beach, California,
who describe their music as ""a fusion of acoustic rock and blues with
reggae, hip-hop, and punk"". As a band, they have released seven albums
(2 live) with their fifth studio album, entitled ""Chronchitis"",
released on August 7, 2007, not counting other bootleg albums created
by dedicated fans. The band was originally signed by Bradley
Nowell from the band Sublime to his label Skunk Records. Sublime was
obviously a great influence to the band, along with roots reggae bands
from Jamaica such as the Melodians, The Upsetters, Sugar Minott, and
Junior Murvin, just to name a few. Other non-reggae influences are Dr.
Dre, Sublime, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Police, & Miles Davis, along
with other genres such as rock, reggae, blues, roots, hip hop, metal,
dub, and punk.

,catamaranman,2010-11-23T20:56Z,"YUCK!!  What a Shitty Upload!  I'm not going to waste my time listing all the tracks that have problems.  Just remember.....the crappy punk songs don't skip or have huge gaps in the songs!  It's just the good songs that sound like shit! (XD>
Do the community and posterity a mutual favor and help this torrent DIE!  Its too terrible of an upload to have been around for SO LONG!"
