,JadeHunterStarrz,2008-02-01T21:36Z,I'm at 28.9% and as soon as this finishes I shall become a long term seeder. This movie is one of my favorites and I have missed it greatly.
,JadeHunterStarrz,2008-02-10T00:48Z,"Okay, I am the ONLY seeder and I am seeding 24/7 but I would be thankful if some other people would help me when they reach completion."

could you please reseed GOD'S COUNTRY??
that would just make my day!
i have been desperate for that movie for a while,
it's hard to come by: can't even find it on the eMule network...

I would really appreciate your effort!
