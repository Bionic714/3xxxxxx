Live action Dr. Seuss on a scale far different from "The Cat in the Hat" or "The Grinch". Though Seuss did not design the set, it sure looks like it.  He was involved in the screenplay.
Stars Tommy Rettig, who went on to bigger things, like "Lassie".
Yes, this is a kid's movie, but plenty there for the adult.  Reminds me of the bitter cynicism of Gene Wilder in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" which was over my head as a child.
They really don't make them like this any more.
