TV is 640x480 (some times 720x480) and 24 fps, so there isn't much of a difference."

First of all the video and sound quality isn't incredible but it's not not that bad. There is something really awful though.

The shows cuts out way too early when there is supposed to be a commercial and it comes back on way too late.

The final problem is that when I tried to convert these for DVD the audio was completely out of sync. A problem i've never had before.

Do not download this. Try to find another copy of season 3 or just buy it/netflix it."
