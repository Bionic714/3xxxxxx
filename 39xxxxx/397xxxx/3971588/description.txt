December 5th 1977 the musicshow ?Elvis? opened at the Astoria Theatre in London West End. It was produced by wellknown TV-showproducer Jack Good (Shindig, Oboy! Around the Beatles). Tim Whitnall played the part of Elvis as a teenager, Shakin┬┤Stevens ?middle Elvis? and PJ Proby  was ?Las Vegas-Elvis?.

The music from this musical was sold as an LP-album at the theatre only and has not, to my knowledge, been reproduced as a CD. I have ripped this album which is presented here in full.Great music with some really exciting medleys, ?Elvis? won Evening Standard┬┤s award ?Best Musical of the Year 1978?.

I have added three songs, not in the musical,  in which PJ Proby covers three Elvis-songs, I believe, Do you know who I am and one minute of a demo Proby made for Elvis, Fun in Acapulco (Sorry, only got one minute of this beautiful song in my possession).

PJ Proby is 70 years in november 2008 and is still touring and releasing - mostly lowbudget ? DVDs and CDs.
