,Joker1974,2009-03-20T06:06Z,"Okay, I think I fixed the problem. You need to change the properties of ""pony.exe"" to run in compatibility mode for Windows 95, resolution to 640x480, and everything else you can do to make your system seem as old as possible.

This made that little Pork Chop stop complaining about disk space... although the program still crashed occasionally. Can't do much better with a game that's over 10 years old, I suppose.

Good luck! :)"
