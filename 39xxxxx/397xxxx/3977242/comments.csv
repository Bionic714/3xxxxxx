This compilation is the complete Season 1 series. Enjoy and enjoy and seed and seed......."
,death734,2008-01-15T00:15Z,"yeah but it will also be broadcast on BBC one (PDTV rather than DSR from bbca) and probably from BBC HD as well which annihilates hdnets quality thus making much better 720p encodes and probably better 350mb HDTV rips weeks earlier
in other words you don't have to worry about (or even record) USA rips as the UK ones are what count"
,djnw,2008-01-19T00:11Z,"This *badly* needs someone to seed - the last seed disappeared 2 days ago, and now the whole thing's just distributing what people have got amongst themselves"
,dr_byte,2008-01-28T22:29Z,I'm still here seeding. So there's still at least one seeder up.

,TorchwoodLover,2008-02-14T21:41Z,"OMG!
Im Soo Annoyed With ThePirateBay and uTorrent!
It isn't uTorrents fault everytime I try and download this is says it will take a week and 5 days or there is no seeders or something else goes wrong. Can anybody get me a small file HQ Season 1 of Torchwood tht doesnt affect uTorrent??
Love U xx"
,fatdeeman,2008-02-18T14:50Z,"Looks like an amazing torrent but as said previously there is an episode MISSING!!!!

Please fix or release missing episode seperetely!"
,dr_byte,2008-02-20T22:26Z,"Much to my chagrin I lost 1 1tb hard drive  a few days ago. The was a bunch of stuff that I could not get off the drive.  Torchwood was one of the victims. I will continue posting when the hard drive is replaced. At least a couple weeks away.
