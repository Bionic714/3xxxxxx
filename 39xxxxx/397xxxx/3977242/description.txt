Torchwood Season 1 [2006] The Complete Compilation

These episodes were ripped from the original BBC set of dvds. Thery are, therefore, unedited.

With the exception of an occassional 'bad' word taken out protect those pristine American ears episodes shown by the BBCA in the states are unalterred.

I can't imagine anyone watching Torchwood being unable to tolerate curse words but you never know what the great American Brain Trust is scared of these days.
