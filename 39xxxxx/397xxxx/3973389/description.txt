Okay... it's not a DVD per-se.  I think it makes more sense to let people cherry-pick which videos they want.

We're getting lazy and haven't actually DONE any of these videos.  All but the Kundalini videos are very good productions from known sources.  The Kundalini video seems a little weird... probably a plus for you new-age types!

Some of you may know about my Sara Ivanhoe crush.  Let's just say I have a hard time focusing on my breathing when Sara's bending over in these videos.  Sara, if you're reading this, sorry about stealing your stuff.  Call me. (Luckily, Mook never reads my torrent descriptions or I'd be dead.)

The first few peers will need extra patience.  I'm switching internet providers in a few days so I might go down for a few hours.  And my upstream is utterly awful, so when you seed try to go 2:1 or more if you can.

Cheers!
