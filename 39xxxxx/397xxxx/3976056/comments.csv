,Stone-D,2008-01-14T04:58Z,"Ok, here goes :

1) Is there a map for Indonesia, specifically Jakarta?

2) I've tried a number of times to get this installed, but always get a not supported message from my n95. What gives?"
,hsm01,2008-01-14T05:16Z,Give me the tekst of the message
,Stone-D,2008-01-14T07:47Z,"I believe its something like ""Feature Not Supported"". I think its something to do with the fact that I don't have chinese fonts on my phone... at least that's what folks at ipmart have said.

I'll try to redownload tonight to get the exact message."

,hsm01,2008-01-14T19:52Z,"Stone-D, you have to be more specified. Have you checked your software version ( see manual). 
At what moment does your Nokia give the message, does it starts installing? Have you done exactly as the manual indicates?

,grOyaBetariP,2008-07-27T18:08Z,"I cannot understand why so many idiots are still asking others to sign SIS files - get a grip of yourselves, go to 
https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page 
create a user account, standard email addresses are of NO USE, avoid hotmail, tiscali, etc, etc....if you need a usable email address go here and sign up for one, 
http://www.2ip.com/signup.php
Then head to 
https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do
LOGIN, then look down that page until you see a box where you put your phones IMEI, your newly made email address and point symbian to your SIS file for signing, if you dont see the word SUCCESS at the top of the page after uploading your SIS file, you fucked up, try again!.....when you've got that right, move on, read everything, follow all the prompts - its easy, if you fail in the end, stick a feather up your arse and do the funky chicken!
