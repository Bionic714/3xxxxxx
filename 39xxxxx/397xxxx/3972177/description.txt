The Original is certainly a very decent production, but is not too much my thing being on the more Deep house side of things.  I haven't been able to leave this (being the only) remix alone since the day it was released.


Roll up a big fat spliff and make a little room for your body move.. the track will do the rest.



Enjoy and please seed.
