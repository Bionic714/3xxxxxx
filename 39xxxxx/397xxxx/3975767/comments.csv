,dukeofurl,2008-04-24T08:12Z,"Is this really NTSC, or is it PAL?  I ask because I found what I think to be the same release at Demonoid, but it says it is PAL.  I am in the US, so I suppose I want NTSC, but does it really matter anyhow?  Anyone that has downloaded this already, which is it?  NTSC or PAL?"
