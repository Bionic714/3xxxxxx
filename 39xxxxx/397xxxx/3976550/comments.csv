,drone07,2008-01-16T18:11Z,Mmm..... if i had it...
,pezoamo,2008-01-20T21:57Z,God damn
,junoaudio,2008-01-24T01:53Z,There is no Key for the packages. 
,drone07,2008-02-03T23:46Z,You actually need a key? I never did..
,drone07,2008-02-04T12:41Z,"Uhh... alright, i just realized something - it was pointless to bother posting these. These are just official preset packages, for said devices, which can all be downloaded, along with plenty of others, from the Ableton site: http://www.ableton.com/livepacks

I'm guessing that Sampler and Operator are built into Live 7. Electric, Tension and Analog have their own separate DLL's though.... if anyone needs me to post those, let me know."
,junoaudio,2008-02-06T04:58Z,"Yeah Drone, we need the actual instruments with the Key, If you have it that would be a awesome. Thanks"
,drone07,2008-02-06T11:50Z,"I'm actually using the release by AIR, found here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3932735/Ableton.Live.v7.0.1.WORKING-AiR

All the extra devices, or ""products"", are unlocked automatically with it. So, that is an option.

I get the impression the only thing anyone would need with a normal installation though, are the serials to unlock certain features. If you look around, i imagine there's a keygen out there somewhere by now...



Off the subject of that, if anyone reading happens to have the Essential Instrument Collection package(s), for Live 7.. it would be great if you could post it. It's suppose to be a few gigs from what i understand... i haven't found it yet."
,musicman52,2008-05-04T03:43Z,"hey drone, could you possible post the serial number that came with the version of live you are using? or do you know where i could find a keygen? i can't seem to find one to unlock the drum machines upload that you did. any ideas?"
