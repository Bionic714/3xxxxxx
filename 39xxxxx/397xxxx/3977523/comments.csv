,tinuviel949,2008-02-20T07:39Z,"seriously betty no ghetto speak in here, this is for adults only."
,caissa0,2008-02-27T03:34Z,So is the quality ok or not?
,jarralise,2008-04-01T11:02Z,Please seed...
,merlino211,2008-04-14T19:38Z,"The quality on this... lol... That's all I can say... LOL. You've gotta be shitting me. This was, from the first scene, dark, grimy, blurry, and a joke considering its supposed to be a DVD rip. 

I'd give it:

V: 3/10
A: 9/10
overall: 2"
,Clintyfresh163,2008-04-26T22:10Z,"My god, was george born in America?"
,marsarie,2008-06-25T06:31Z,"Looks like George has been doing lots of txt msging.  Tradeoffs come with new technology, which, evidently is shaping some cultures, like it or not.  The scary thing is, most of us know most of what he's saying; and for the rest, get a cell phone and start text messaging. :)"
,Damericus,2008-07-03T17:24Z,"I got a phone but I dont write like a fucking idiot just cause I have a phone. George just raped the english language so bad that it will need years in therapy to recover.

The quality of this torrent is good."
,bigsexystix,2008-07-04T21:50Z,"sorry to put this comment here but I knew of nowhere to put it...please do the ocean's 11 12 and 13 movies.  Noone seems to have a good copy of 12 and I love the quality of your flix.  And if you could, respond so that I know that you got my message.   Thanx Alot"
,laparapa,2008-07-27T06:44Z,"hlo george. i spk ur lnguge. plz stfu, bcus u r anoyng. kthxbai."
,wrract,2008-10-25T11:54Z,"Wow George, what the heck are you even trying to say? All I understood was ""play the movie."""
,bloodyjimbonney,2009-01-16T05:29Z,"go easy on george, he's obviously missing some keys on his keyboard"
,fritz fleischer,2009-02-17T03:21Z,My reply to George's message and every message after: LOL!!!
,Nitzrokk,2009-03-23T19:09Z,I not 1nt maek da sound cum. dtz a ledda gros 4 me.
,tpb_mvp,2009-05-30T10:09Z,klaxxon give us fucking a/v specs dude. we know your uploads are quality but we still need to know before we download. thanks for the up. epic movie
,piratebay,2009-11-13T18:04Z,"I agree with marsarie. I understood most of what george was saying. But yes, he could have written in proper english though.

I also agree with tpb_mvp. Please include the video specs/info too KLAXXON..!!"
,daniel7066,2010-01-04T05:36Z,"George needs to go back to first grade.  Being able to understand what someone is saying is different than being able to *decipher* what they are saying.  Stop talking in code, or being a ghettoassmofo, whichever you prefer to call it."
