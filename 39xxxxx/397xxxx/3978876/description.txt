A screenwriter suffering from writers block
decides to lock himself in his apartment for
18 days in order to meet a career-making
deadline. His script involves characters from
his past, including a terrifying and
disfigured clown. As cabin fever sets, he soon
finds himself living in a world where what's
real and what's fiction begin to cross lines
with chilling and fatal consequences.
