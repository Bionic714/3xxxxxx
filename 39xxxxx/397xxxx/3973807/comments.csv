or is it just fake"
,Psychomania,2008-01-13T01:30Z,its working 100% thanx to -muzzy- for the upload
,HaywoodGiablomi,2008-01-14T02:10Z,J U N K ! ! !  I had 12 days left on my grace period.  After installing this I rebooted only to be informed my copy was invalid and needed to be validated through M$ site immediately(!).  Fortunately i had backed up my registry.  Run Away!!!
,-Muzzy-,2008-01-14T07:37Z,"Well I've been using this for the past 2 years, on different installations of Windows XP and never had ANY problems. Are you even using Windows XP?"
,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-01-15T08:00Z,"Muzzy, 

i didnt need this file, but i downloaded it and am permanently seeding it on my T1, since it's only a 1k reg file, anyone, even on dialup can snag it from me, the only time i will not be seeding is if the power goes out, which is never because my server's on a battery backup ;-) your wish is my command.

great upload!!"

,carlzohn,2008-01-20T05:02Z,"Yep, I'm joining the choir of approval... ;-) It works like a charm... thank you...!"
,Triel,2008-01-27T06:21Z,"I tried this on an older XP setup and it worked great. Then I tried it on a fresh install and it dropped the countdown to 0 and locked me out of XP till I activated it normally.

Not sure why it did this, but I do have to agree it works and it may not work."
,-Muzzy-,2008-01-27T09:24Z,"Well I have used this ""crack"" many times directly after a fresh install and alwas worked great. But come to think of it I've never tried it on an old version of XP (SP1 or older). 

But I'm glad to see the amount of positive comments :)"
