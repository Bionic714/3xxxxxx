,Nickenbokan,2008-04-02T00:59Z,"that finished very quickly.
this is not an iso file and i'm not sure how to burn this to a disk, anybody wanna help me out here?"
,XXBeeBeeXX,2008-04-03T14:33Z,"Hi Nickenbokan. 
You should have dowloaded a bunch of files where the last of them should have the extension 'rar'. 
Install Winrar and then double click the rar-file to unshrink it into one ISO file at a destination of your choise. Now hereafter you should know what to do :)

Cheers
