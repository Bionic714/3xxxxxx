,knickerbockers,2008-01-26T21:19Z,Please be aware that one of the games has adware.
,knickerbockers,2008-01-26T21:19Z,"I should clarify that the game was ""Granny in Paradise."""

,hellepelle8,2008-02-03T16:31Z,"I've downloaded, and when I try to install cd1 it wants me to insert cd 1. What to do? I'm sure this is a piece of cake, but I'm not very good at it.. Thanks!"
,hellepelle8,2008-02-06T05:59Z,"
Please help me, I really want to make this work! It says in the instr. that cd 1 will install, but it won't, because halfway through it tells me to insert cd1. "

[T],toxicjuggalo,2008-02-22T16:09Z,excellent job..it works flawlessly ...
,Vanterion,2008-03-10T07:45Z,"Be aware that this file contains a very serious adware file. I removed it using Ad-Aware.

For people who say the program asks for a CD to be inserted, you don't need the CD. Just browse to the folder called ""CD2"" of this torrent and the setup will continue. If you can't understand that, there's no hope for you."
,lwwolf,2008-03-10T15:56Z,"Great install, quick and easy. Games work great, have been playing bejeweled 2 a lot since I finished the download. Thanks dtrbot ! ! "

,Nick2412,2008-04-18T08:14Z,"It can be really annoying that it adds all those games to start>all programs cause when u open it it goes very slow snd stuff so i would recommend just click cut and paste somewhere else like desktop, and btw u gota uninstall one by one"
,solidad81,2008-04-22T22:05Z,nice dl with the exception that so far 18 games are in 1 hour demo mode therefore  they of course ask for the serials
,noorman10,2008-04-25T18:48Z,Avira found Worm in Gamehouse.exe
,brandonsharksfan,2008-04-27T20:27Z,"I noticed that as well. Many of the games ask for a serial and they are only the demos!

Any fixes???"
,Edfaminc,2008-05-28T07:17Z,Nice! downloaded this for my mom for her birthday she says she will never have to buy a overpriced flash game ever again!

,josepfring,2008-10-11T15:44Z,"why some other games ask license? like AIR STRIKE 3D, what I'm going to do"
,josepfring,2008-10-13T05:34Z,"why there is no answer or maybe you don't also?,  dtrbot you said no serial needed, but why some games need license?"
,marzic,2008-11-05T07:18Z,"When I play Mad Caps, after I close and re-open it, the high scores are gone. Has anyone had this problem?"

,marblezilla,2009-07-31T11:38Z,"I am using these games with no problems:
Air Strike 3D, Alien Sky, Astrobatics, Atomaders, Luxor, Magic Ball (3 Ver), Platypus, Ricochet (3 ver), Super Bounce Out!, Super Collapse! (3 Ver), Ten Pin Championship Bowling Pro, Tennis Titans & Zuma Deluxe.

On my 1st install try, I had included the 2 Gutterballs & Hampsterball. My Panda AV stopped the install at Hampsterball warning of a virus (Herpes?). I removed the 3 ""Ball"" games from the list and had a perfect install. Pretty sure they all tested out fine. Since Hampster is after Gutter alphabetically, they might be ok. Thats assuming the files load by order of the name.

I'll try some of the others out laters, more into high-visual action/arcade shooters anyways. It was worth it to play Platypus again!!!"
,steve_00,2009-08-04T18:53Z,"Alien sky and air strike have virus .....scaned with nortons,avast,loaris the other games are clean."
,pschomagnet,2010-01-30T09:13Z,what do you gain by adding a virus to this otherwise nice collection.I will download it and use them but please enlighten me.
,BramBarb,2010-03-12T12:56Z,"I have used these games for quite some time now. My grandson loves them and I have now had these on several computers and have had absolutely no problems--no viruses at all so I don't know what everybody is talking about. They have passed both McAfee and Kaspersky!

Thank you for this selection, as on my budget, I can't buy many things for my computer."
,iiiratep,2010-03-17T21:22Z,"Scanned the installer and then all the files after the install. No viruses! MSE is good about that, but others like Avast have been known to report lots of false positives.

The games seems to work just fine. Thanks :]"
,jakerson20,2010-04-14T09:16Z,tnx for the upload its great!!more power men!!

,8wizard8,2012-02-15T04:04Z,"To all,

You might experience error in installing especially in the part that jigsaw dll or something is not accessible just try to ignore it and program will proceed as normal.

The games works great! "
