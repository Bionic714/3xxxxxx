Note from the ripper:
Hello everyone. I`ve noticed that a lot of good movies have slipped through the cracks of the ripping community. Some movies are no where to be found. If you are an avid movie collector, like myself, than you know exactly what I`m talking about. I am dedicated to bringing you all the good movies that you just can`t seem to find, so you can fill those unseemly holes in your collection.
When it comes to quality, I have one golden rule: If I wouldn`t put it in my own collection, than I wouldn`t post it.

Plot

In the last months of the Second World War, an American administrative Lieutenant is captured by German forces during the Battle of the Bulge. Sent to a German Stalag Prison camp, Lieutenant Hart is at once thrust into the social order of POWs, where every man thinks of himself first with bribery and trading with German captors commonplace. When two African American pilots become the first non-white soldiers in the camp, one is murdered and the other accused of killing a white sergeant. Lieutenant Hart must then defend the black pilot against charges before an obviously racist American tribunal; unaware that the trial itself is only a front for the real secret of the prison camp.
