The serial can be tracked to the original owner. He does not want it to be on torrent because he is scared. so PLEASE RESPECT THE WISHES OF THE ORIGINAL OWNER.
thank you very much :)"
,BeOSDano0,2008-01-13T19:44Z,I XXX-XXX out the original serial number.
,BeOSDano0,2008-01-13T20:02Z,"I removed the torrent and won't seed it, as you requested. You must know that the the file you put out there can and will be seeded by others. It's too late to worry about your friend. I doubt that anyone reallys care anymore about Zeta except those few BeOS users."
,BaronVonchesto,2008-01-14T02:31Z,He has no problem about it being on torrent. He just dunt want his serial out there. I know that its too late but im just respecting his wish. i too agree with what you said though!. zeta is out. :(
,hrm27,2008-02-02T01:23Z,"Hey BeOSDano0, need a little help with this. I downloaded this but I have tried to burn it with several software like alcohol 120, imgburn and others and what I get is a cd not recognized. Even if I tried to mount the image with poweriso or alcohol 120 to extract it with no luck. Anybody has had any luck with this image. I even try mounting it on a mac but it says not recognized"
,BeOSDano0,2008-02-02T02:15Z,"Simply burn the cue/bin file with Nero. It will create a Zeta 1.5 install CD. Because it is a BFS file system CD, Windows software will not recognise it."
,hrm27,2008-02-02T12:39Z,"Hey BeOSDano0 thanks for fast response. there is a img, cue and ccd. I at first tried to burn with clonecd as ccd files are propietary of clonecd but clonecd wouldnt burn it cause it gave an error with ccd file. Is there anyway I can verify the cd I burn with alcohol 120. thanks in advance"
,hrm27,2008-02-03T05:22Z,Hey BeOSDano0 I FINALLY GOT IT RUNNING. THANKS!!!!
