,asysan,2008-01-14T18:03Z,"Domo zlo666, I wanna ask you for a big desire:

Please keep posting ALL days, 'cause since this basho, European people will have no more Eurosport coberture and perhaps this is gonna be the only way to watch at the bashos with this HIGH quality."
,zlo666,2008-01-14T20:10Z,"I'm trying to record all 15 days, but sometimes I f* up :)
Anyways, if you're in Europe and have a satellite dish you can watch sumo. Pity that they've cancelled sumo coverage on eurosport, I liked Sid Hoare's commentary."
,udonyama,2008-01-14T20:50Z,"It's really possible to watch sumo in Europe wiht a dish? and what is the channel?
In the meantime really thank you for posting from an Italian Sumofan !!!!!"

,CZFreeman,2008-01-14T23:01Z,"Big thanks from the Czech Republic, I have also watched sumo on eurosport even with czech commentary, but unfortunately as was said earlier, they have cancelled it, so this is my best chance to continue watching it. Thank you one more time."
