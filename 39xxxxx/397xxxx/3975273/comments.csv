,danadrake,2008-12-22T19:33Z,how do i convert the file type from iso?
,nocurbahead,2009-02-04T16:02Z,"it is totally useless , this file.
impossible to get it working, and this dude has not any information added HOW to get it working.
DO NOT DOWNLOAD! IT IS TOTALLY USELESS!"
[T],eyezin,2009-02-10T11:40Z,"First of there a .txt file to read
1. You mount the image (.iso) to virtual (MS has one or my favourite is PowerISO)
2 Install it or burn it to disk you can even download IZArc for free and extract it to a folder and install it from there 

nocurbahead don't leave idiotic comments on peoples work when your obviously clueless. I can understand people who are stuck but there's no need for your comment.     "
,Conor0909090909,2009-02-26T23:18Z,"It is probably easier to download the file, and use a key that is provided:

[T],eyezin,2009-03-12T20:15Z,"probably isn't, Its an image you can burn straight to disk and not a self extracting .exe"
,East Lansing,2009-09-25T05:02Z,"It requires an authorization code after install, but arturoimaz provided it above!  Thanks to arturoimaz."
[T],eyezin,2009-11-07T03:56Z,"East Lansing, don't forget to thank magical pixies that mysteriously added a text file that can only be read when opened and is obscurely named INFO."
,East Lansing,2010-01-27T00:01Z,Thanks to the magical pixies!  It's all good.
