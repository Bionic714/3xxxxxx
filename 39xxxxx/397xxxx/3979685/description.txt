There's little argument that Slash is a great guitarist, capable of making rock and blues clich√©s sound fresh. On his solo project, Slash's Snakepit, he plays a lot and most of his playing is quite amazing. It's too bad that nobody in the band bothered to write any songs.
-AllMusic 4.5/5

Probably the worst review I've ever read for an album that got such a high rating but if you are a fan of the type of music Slash was known for back in his prime you will love this album. It's really a forgotten classic.
