,D-RAWKCITY,2009-04-05T07:43Z,dont be  an  asshole... go see the movie and find a way to give these hardworkin hosers some money!
,Smut_Pile,2009-04-07T08:38Z,This is great. Thanks a lot for the upload! I learned about the band from the documentary at the Wisconsin Film fest three days ago. I like what I heard in the movie & I wanted to sample the rest to see which albums I want to buy. I'll probably get a t-shirt too.
,Tylerhad1,2009-07-16T09:29Z,"Amazing and very important torrent here! ANVIL needs the respect and recognition they have been working for, for 30+ years. I strongly encourage people to see the movie and buy their albums (Hard 'N' Heavy, Metal on Metal, Forged in Fire, Backwaxed, Back to Basics, and This is Thirteen, the only albums still in print). This torrent keeps the majority of their career alive which would have otherwise been lost due to these albums being out of print. Thank-you Blyoung for doing ANVIL a great deed and ensuring their music is still heard."
,lizzyborden,2009-11-19T00:11Z,"I agree, I loved Anvil in High School in the late 80's.  Never saw anything about them after that and no stores had thier stuff. The movie explains why, poor management!  Go forth and buy if you like it.  These guys still rock hard after many years!"
