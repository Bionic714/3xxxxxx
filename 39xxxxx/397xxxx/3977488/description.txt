If you like the music, buy the albums!


These are only 192 kbit mp3 files, because I encourage you to buy the albums!
However, I have done everything I can to ensure highest quality possible.

I have personally ripped all these from my own personal cds. I have manually entered in all the information for mp3 id tags.

Now... I like to listen to these on my computer.  I load them into windows media player and then hit shuffle.  So I've done some editing via Cool Edit Pro to make the transitions between songs more pleasing.

Live songs have been edited so that crowd cheering fades out between every song.  And studio songs have been adjusted for volume so that the songs are not different volumes.  (This was not exact, as I did it manually using cool edit.  It's for my own purposes.)

That said, this will give you a nice idea of Anvil - classic Canadian heavy metal.  Check them out, and then buy their albums.

There's only 3 songs missing that I know of:
 -- I don't have the japanese version of Speed of Sound, so there's two bonus songs missing there.
 -- I don't have the canadian version of Plenty of Power, so there's one bonus song missing there.
 -- I didn't rip the audio from the bonus dvd included with Back to Basics, so there's a few songs missing there.

But otherwise this torrent includes everything that has been legimately released by Anvil.
