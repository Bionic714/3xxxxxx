,galdau88,2008-04-08T01:08Z,Thanks man.I hope you guys are still seeding this.
,hogthemovie,2008-07-26T04:44Z,This is a powerful movie that's based on a true story. DiCaprio & DeNiro's performance is fantastic. I've had this movie on VHS for years but I'd love to have it on digital. Please seed :D

,haciendaman,2008-11-12T13:50Z,I downloaded this but all I got was the sound & no video?? Any ideas? Anyone else have the same problem? Not had any probs with any other downloads.
,haciendaman,2008-11-14T02:13Z,"Bizarrely, I can now see the video & sound fine when I play in Windows Media Player, but when I try to burn to DVD with Nero, it won't do it? Any ideas??"
,Knikers87,2009-01-16T05:03Z,If you're looking to play this movie...forget windows media player (what a waste of computer space)...download vlc player (google it). No need to download codecs...best media player out there imo

,MarkoOhNo,2011-05-17T11:05Z,"Good movie. The book the movie is based on is MUCH, much better."
,MarkoOhNo,2011-05-18T07:03Z,"Unfortunately, this copy is a waste of download time. Tried multiple players but it won't do anything. No matter how many times you press Play, it won't move beyond 0:00:00. Deleting & looking for another copy."

""Broken file"" so I had to have VLC attempt an ""index"" to fix it and it worked. Will report back when I try to burn it.
