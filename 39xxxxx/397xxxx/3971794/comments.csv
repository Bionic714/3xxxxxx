Although, when I download this is comes up as a avi file called The Evil Below dvd rip.  What's the deal?"
[V],joshua13,2008-01-11T21:32Z,"loubega1 you must have made an error - this torrent file has 33 separate comic, no avi. in a folder called Captain America v5. I just verified this"
,loubega1,2008-01-11T22:19Z,"hmmm... still isn't working for me.  i don't know what the problem is.  i had my gf do it and it worked fine for her so i'll just get this from her. 

still, much appreciated.  thanks!"
