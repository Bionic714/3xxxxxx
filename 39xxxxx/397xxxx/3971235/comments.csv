,fabletown,2008-01-11T07:34Z,"thanx for these, oxbladder.  can you tell me where to write requests on comicsearch?  i've been looking for almost all the issues of hack/slash (ongoing & minis).  only the most recent three issues are available since zcult went down."
,oxbladder,2008-01-12T01:16Z,"http://www.comicsearch.co.uk/forum/

Register and in the members section of the forum there is a Request forum and the Single Issue Request section is a child forum of this. Please read the rules of the SIR forum before posting. "
,oxbladder,2008-01-12T01:18Z,BTW I can probably cover all of that Hack/Slash stuff. I have it on disc here somewhere but we would love more members of the forum. If you can contribute to filling requests too that would be great
,fabletown,2008-01-12T07:33Z,thnx for the info oxbladder.  i will register over there.  as for hack/slash i see that lazz99 has just created a torrent here a few minutes ago so i should be good on those.  thnx again.
