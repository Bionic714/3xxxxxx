_____________________________________________________________Summary__

This is the most authoritative and revealing account to date (2004) 
of the secret war between the Western intelligence agencies and 
al-Qaeda's networks. Soon after 9/11, it became clear that a global 
enemy could only be countered by a global response. That would mean 
unparalleled international co-operation and, critically, the sharing 
of intelligence between governments and counter-terrorism agencies.
This series focuses on the response of the United States, Western 
Europe and South East Asia - with unprecedented access to British 
and American intelligence agencies across the world and to the 
terrorists themselves, including an exclusive interview with the 
four Bali bombers.

This program shows how al Qaeda's global network was uncovered and 
how, in response to counterterrorism, that network has evolved new 
structures and strategies. Through detailed interviews with American
security officials, European intelligence agents, and alleged
terrorist organizer Salim Boukhari, the program describes operations
that led to the capture of a Frankfurt terrorist cell in 2000.
The resilience of terrorist groups is emphasized, with one al Qaeda
hunter comparing the network to a disease - a virus that quickly
mutates to avoid destruction.
