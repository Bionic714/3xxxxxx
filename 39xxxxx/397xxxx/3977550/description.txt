The retail package contained an audio disc and a CD-Rom with 300MB of content in various formats. I\'m only uploading the WAVs, which have been normalized and trimmed where appropriate. All files are 44.1KHz.

Categories: Instrument Oneshots (bass, brass, pianos, strings etc), Drum + Perc oneshots, Drum and Perc loops at 125bpm, Instrument loops (guitar, rhodes, organ etc with root note/key in filename), Vocals (male and female).

Please be patient when downloading in the first few days, as my bandwidth is limited. When complete, please seed for as long as possible for the benefit of all. Finally, upload something if you think it might be useful to others. If I can do it, so can you!
