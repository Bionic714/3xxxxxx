This is a huge torrent, I can't seed this forever. If you download this, it's very important that you continue seeding it."
,randal1013,2008-01-16T04:57Z,"Ok, well I've seeded this torrent 10 times over, it seems like everyone who wanted it has it, and there are a handful of seeders standing by for you latecomers. I am now going to reclaim my bandwidth and let the community carry the torch."

(5 leechs, 2 seeds)

anyone having trouble decoding these flac files?
use flac 1.2.0 instead of 1.2.1
as per this thread: http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=57624"
,japface,2008-04-01T16:55Z,So this would give me the real dvd-a surround sound then? not the bs dvd-v rips most of the torrents seem to be in.
,nympholept,2008-04-03T05:41Z,"japface: no, i don't think so.

These files are 48KHz, DVD-Audio should be 96KHz.
I thought these were DVD-A as well, but after looking it up and checking the files, it seems like they're not.

randal1013 says he extracted the MLP files - which are the DVD-Audio files, not DVD-Video.

Perhaps these are sourced from the DVD-Audio, but were encoded down along the way.

But I may be completely wrong!
I don't have my DVD-A handy at the moment, so I can't check it."
,nympholept,2008-04-03T05:53Z,"Oops, my last comment was COMPLETELY WRONG.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Audio
""DVD-Audio cannot be delivered via unencrypted digital audio link at sample rates higher than 48kHz (i.e., ordinary DVD-Video quality) due to concerns about digital copying""

While true DVD-Audio should be at least 96kHz, standard DVD-Audio extraction is limited to 48kHz.

So while the answer to japface's question is still technically ""no"", (it will not give you a real DVD-A)
this is not DVD-V, and is the best quality DVD-Audio rip that can be extracted.

Thankyou randal1013!"
,japface,2008-05-08T07:21Z,is it possible to make an iso file that would have the identical quality of the dvd-a cause i did download this and it really doesnt sound as good as the dvd-a i had -- unfortuantely my dvd drive scratched my dvd-a a long while back which is why i've been looking for something to substitute. i suppose making an iso would still be digital extraction.
,Werm,2010-01-29T20:15Z,I'll seed this 500%. Big thanks!
