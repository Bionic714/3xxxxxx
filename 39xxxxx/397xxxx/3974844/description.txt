Second album release from Melbourne instrumental band Angler.  This is the follow up to 1998 album In Search of Charm which was by far a great album.  Lonesome High has some excellent melodies that seem to creep up on you while listening and slowly work their way into your conscious.  Well known for their stunning live performances and amazing atmospheric grooves.  Angler's music is a combination of electronic / loose beats / twangy guitar riffs.
