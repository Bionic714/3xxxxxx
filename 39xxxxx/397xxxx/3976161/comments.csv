,heather1a,2008-05-14T14:00Z,"Hi, I'm stuck at 99.9% - I've skipped the list.txt file (as you said in 1st comment it was moved / changed), but the song LEG159-16 - Bringing Out The Elvis - Hill, Faith.zip is stuck at 99.1% - can someone seed again please? Been stuck like this for about a day now.  Thanks loads"
