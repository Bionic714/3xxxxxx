,MorpheusRO,2008-02-06T13:12Z,"Dear users, 
I have listen to what both parts had to say. Although people should generally get along and act mature ... leaving that fact aside this release is great. Works as it should. 
Maybe ""DeadDuckSWE"" was joking, i am not aware of his behavior on other torrents. 
As a final conclusion: people, download this torrent it works great and stop acting so immature. "

Im not saying this error happens to everyone but ive gotten it twice actually, about a week ago i reformatted due to the same error (wasn't able to find it then, never thought about NOD 32) so perhaps there is something wrong with one of the recent updates. Im using Vista with SP1.

i have had a d-loaded version of nod32 on 2 of my computers and there has never been a problem.

for all the retarded assholes who keep telling everyone on every torrent that this sort of torrents are filled with viruses just shows how damn incompetent you guys are. in almost every program you d-load from here there is a crack(a hacker made module made so everyone can enjoy the program) and that is what the antivirus program sees and rapports as a virus, the same with every program, the same with every game. so stop being such dicks, and you may notice that most ppl here just wants to help.
