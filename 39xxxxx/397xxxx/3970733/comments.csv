,nauruzu,2008-12-03T14:44Z,"gang16, are there any sequels? name it."
,whitewyrm,2009-02-23T11:02Z,Is this in english? There is one floating about that is in Spanish or something.
,jugerts,2009-04-16T18:46Z,soo...uhh...is this in english?
,listserv,2009-05-24T08:09Z,"This is in dubbed English, if anyone cares. A rather decent production, all told."
[T],bill_214,2009-06-14T19:33Z,"This is ""Tarzan X - Shame of Jane"".......

It's in English.

I realize that ""jungle Heat is an alternative title however in the beginning titles this is titled ""Tarzan X - Shame of Jane"".......rather than the supposed alternative title.

Pretty decent flick IMO."

This sucks....
There are only 2 scenes in the jungle and some scenes are cut! and most of the great sex scenes in the jungle are removed!
This version is incomplete and not the full version of the movie.Who the hell removed the best scenes in the awesome movie!
I know because this is one of my favorite x movies but I have it VHS.
