Islamic terrorists have taken innocent people hostage... and only super-soldiers Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin can rescue them in this astounding mix of fact, fantasy and heavy-duty adventure. The Delta Force is non-stop explosive, wall-to-wall action!

When a U.S. passenger plane is seized by vicious arab terrorists and taken to Beirut, the President calls in The Delta Force - a crack team of commandos led by Colonel Nick Alexander (Marvin) and Major Scott McCoy (Norris). Against all odds, the men blast into the terrorist compound and - taking no prisoners - rescue the hostages. But the mission is not yet over. A few remaining passengers are being "escorted" to Tehran, Iran, which has been taken over by terrorists only 6 years previously, initiating a desperate race against time as Alexander and McCoy try to save them - and avenge America's honour - before it's too late...

The Delta Force is partially based on the actual hijacking of TWA Flight 847 on 14 June 1985. Many of the events in the movie actually occured.
