,Bosch1,2008-01-16T23:31Z,"Appreciate the upload, M. However, please note that you didn't include the hard-coded English subs for the scene when they were speaking Arabic. You're by no means the only person to make this mistake, but it really screws the movie."
,monkeypoi,2008-01-17T00:49Z,"Hey, it doesn't screw the movie. There's like one scene where he says ""ally akbar hagga"". There were *no* hard-coded subs. There were English subs, but including them would have included ALL subs, like for deaf people. I think you are mistaken here. You see what the DVD player would see.

I have seen problem you describe though, on Godfather 2. About 1/2 an hour of detailed Italian, no subs! Must get a new copy of that.

NOT the case here. You see what your DVD player would see if you pressed 'play'."
,Bosch1,2008-01-18T00:07Z,"Then with respect, Monk ol' thing, there's something wrong with either your DVD player or the disk. I know this move like the back of my hand. There should be around four or five minutes of subtitles all in, including the initial airport exchange between Forster and his henceman, the heated exchange in the control tower, the terrorists boarding the plane and greeting each other, and other scenes. With the subs missing, for whatever reason, certain bits of the film are a bit baffling.

Again though, not just you, an increasing problem for some reason. Ah well, we live and learn. ;)"

,XboxMeister,2008-12-23T05:26Z,"Unfortunately the original DVD didn't have the hard-coded subs for the foreign-language parts.  I've got the disc and like so many DVDs, the studio screwed the pooch and left them off.  So unless you want *all* the subs on (even for the spoken English parts, no joy).  

Maybe corrected in later releases and definitely show up on the broadcast version of the movie....argh!!"
