Journey into Darkness

Depression is an insidious disease with symptoms that are difficult to recognize. In Canada, one in four people suffer from clinical depression. Depression is not the temporary feeling of sadness or the blues we all experience in the normal course of our lives, but a debilitating disease that robs the sufferer of joy and can destroy lives and families. Because of the stigma attached to mental illness, depression can go undiagnosed and untreated for years.

Writer and broadcaster, Cathy Lesage gives an intimate view of what it's like to descend into the darkness of a deep depresson and then struggle back from its depths into the light. Excerpts from Cathy's journal are heard as well as the voices of other depression sufferers along doctors in the mental health profession.

Originally broadcast as an episode of CBC Radio's Ideas program.
