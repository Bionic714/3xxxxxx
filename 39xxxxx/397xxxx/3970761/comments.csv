,panther_123,2008-03-09T12:33Z,Awesome dude!!
,dacarlo,2008-03-16T11:26Z,This works insofar as the program installs and I can run it. HOWEVER the beta is extremely buggy with the CLI breaking every time I load a config. Its way more hassle than its worth.

,scubamage,2009-06-09T15:59Z,"Thanks so much for this. It DOES in fact work like it is supposed to. You must follow the instructions exactly. Its the closest you're going to get to a working version of 7, and very much appreciated. Thank you uploader!"
,georgeico,2009-06-16T19:18Z,Files work perfectly if instructions are followed to the letter.  THANK YOU for the upload!
,rockstra,2009-06-18T00:39Z,Excellent job DarkSlayer666. There are only 3 labs missing from the ISCW section but this torrent is 100% working. So Slacktamer shut the hell up if you don't know nething. It updates but if you do it will lock you out of the labs. So word of advice don't update. 
,doughboyjm,2009-07-22T14:00Z,"Thank you DarkSlayer!!! 
This is a top effort!!

it WORKS and its clean.

im using xp pro sp3 32bit.
i agree with coolboi - ignore step 1  and start with step 2. step 1 is kinda vague. i also did not update it coz ...well, its kinda risky imo.

anyways this works. thanks again!! :)"
,darkesthour786,2009-07-24T01:55Z,"I am running windows vista home premium and cannot find the labpacks and mylabs folders! i cannot get this to work properly, any help would be much appreciated, thanks"
,herotory,2009-08-07T05:38Z,"Thanks veey much DarkSlayer, this one works perfectly.
To anyone have trouble with this one, there is another way to make it works:
1. Install Boson v6, register it with provided keygen. Close it.
2. Install Boson v7, run demo, run Lab Navigator and wait for lab Navigator to complete loading labs and setting. Close it
3. Open Local disk, set folder setting to show all hidden folder. Open folder ""ProgramData\Boson Software\Boson Netsim for CCNP 7.0""
4. Copy folders and file: ""LabPacks"" ; ""MyLabs"" ; ""LabSettings.ini"" -> paste to folder ""Local disk C\Program files\Boson Sofware\Boson Netsim for CCNP""
5. Open Boson Netsim v6, and enjoy Netsim v7 labs n devices"

I get these errors:

Anyone got suggestions?  netSim 6 works on its own, but can't get netSim 7 to work correctly."

,superseguro,2010-03-08T20:56Z,"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, 

I had some problems with ccnp v6, opening the lab in pdf and telnet error.

To fix this
1- Run ccnp v6 in windows xp sp3 compatibility mode
2- Install an older version of adobe reader(5.0 in my case)
3- Install tera term

Thank you once more, this sim Rocks

,th3xer0,2010-05-02T05:12Z,First off thanx to DarkSlayer program works.  Only issue is IPv6... Has anyone managed to get IPv6 (routing RIPng) working at all?  I don't seem to have any IPv6 commands available.  Is this because it is not really version 7? Any ideas?  Other than this though program runs fine.

,Side_Tracked,2011-06-02T11:09Z,"Thanks a lot DarkSlayer666, the package works fine.

However,  there are 2 trojan horses on Netsim for CCNP 6 when you install it. 

TROJAN.HORSE.BACKDOOR.GENERIC13.FVZ
TROJAN.HORSE.PSW.AGENT.AKLJ

The first one piggybacks on ""labcompiler.exe"" and the second one is on ""lab menu.exe""

Just wanted to give all a heads up.

CHEERS"
,davyboy999,2011-10-07T15:28Z,"Hi guys:

Got it fully working in win 7 ultimate 64bit!!

If you get issue with it not finding the telnet program. 
Go to C:\windows\system32\telnet.exe
Right click on telnet, go to security tab, click on edit, select administrators and and change to full control, under allow.

make a folder somewhere called telnet, i create one in C:\telnet as my example.
run cmd.
type in command:

fsutil hardlink create c:\telnet\telnet.exe c:\windows\system32\telnet.exe

Go into netsim and change default telnet in tools
click find and select the telnet copy you made. and then go to help tab in netsim select telnet setup wizard.

Voila!

Also if have problems with PDF down Abode Reader 9 and run it once and click ok on any dialog boxes.

Now try opening a lab

Voila!"
,davyboy999,2011-10-07T19:17Z,"Oh if you cannot find telnet you have to enable it first in Windows 7 and possibly vista. Just search enabling telnet in windows etc...

,glippy,2012-04-14T19:16Z,"really great thing, thank you a lot!
But i have a little trouble: i cann't open labs by ""lab navigator"" - it does not load. I solved this problem as follow:

1) I have to load labs from menu: File/load NetMap
(For Example: C:Program FilesBoson SoftwareBoson NetSim for CCNPMyLabsAdvanced LabsAdvanced Labs (CCNP)Lab 1 - Single Site Networkadv1.top)

2)And then open .PDF
(Example: C:Program FilesBoson SoftwareBoson NetSim for CCNPMyLabsAdvanced LabsAdvanced Labs (CCNP)common 1-Advanced-SingleSiteNetwork.pdf)

 It is not very comfortable... but it works ;)"
,davotglov,2012-06-26T21:52Z,"hi i cannot open the labs in pdf. when i click on the ""view lab"" from boson lab navigator it it opens adobe pdf reader with no lab in it.. and then the boson says ""Your copy of Adobe Acrobat failed to respond in a timely fashion. Please try again"" How to solve it ? 
i tried to follow what @glippy said above but in that folder i have no pdf files .. that folder has some files starting with scenario1.nwc and a some more with extensions as .top and .rtr /// how to make it work ? thanks in advance."
,davotglov,2012-06-26T22:00Z,"it seems that i found the solution.. i was searching in wron directory for pdf.. for ccna the correct directory for the labs pdf is in

there is pdf file which contains all labes,, 24 pages pdf."
