,974613,2008-03-21T14:36Z,Well it's not my fault... Don't limit your upload speed and you'll be ok.
,MrKaiZeR_,2008-03-25T19:10Z,"If you have an 8mbit line as me, for maximum speeds both up and down put 60kb up as limit and you'll get a good dl automatic.

Keep in mind though that max upload we people get are 80kb and that leaves NO speed left for down, remember up and down goes on the same cable.

Never seen this show though, gonna dl it and have a look, thanks for seeding ^^"
,FlameWarrior,2008-04-25T01:03Z,"Yeah, they got around the Jewish reparations issue by restricting their subject to ""American injustices.""  But I have to give P&T props for addressing the circumcision issue in S3-E1.  Americans are quickly moving away from wiener cutting, but Jews keep shoving it down our throats, so to speak.  And yeah, the 10.97GB version does seem to download faster than this one."
,974613,2008-05-04T22:31Z,"sumwun, yes, there is a way. Use utorrent and when you add the torrent from here, select the files from season 4 only and you'll only download those."
,vrolok_1,2008-06-22T08:34Z,"get all of Season 5 here

,bigsexywzp,2008-08-15T22:39Z,"Zakimar and Flamewarrior, find somewhere else to put all that conspiracy theory bullshit. I don't care if you believe it. That's your business, but there's a time and place for everything, you bigoted, intolerant, cock sucking, worthless pieces of human excrement.

If you had really paid any attention, they didn't say that Reparations to the Japanese were bullshit, they said it was well deserved. As long as it's to the SAME people who were wronged, reparations are deserved. If Americans had given former slaves the 20 acres and a mule that they were told they'd recieve, great. But America didn't. But reparations shouldn't be given to the descendants of former slaves, simply because they aren't the people that were wronged.

As for the whole circumcision deal, if that's what the Jewish people believe,so be it. If it's not your religious belief, then shut the fuck up. It's not hurting you. If you feel you were wronged by mommy and daddy having your tiny wee wees clipped when you were babies, there are surgeries to reverse it now. Get over it."
,VU7,2009-01-18T00:23Z,"I can't hear the audio of Season 3, but if I use Videora to convert it to iPod format, I can hear it just fine...

How do I fix this?"
,necrocytosis,2009-01-29T00:08Z,"Good quality rips of an excellent show. Season 2 episode 6 and season 2 episode 10 are incorrectly labeled (they are switched).

MrKaiZeR_: The fact that you upload and download simultaneously using only one cable is irrelevant. The reason for capping your upload speed is due to the way the TCP/IP protocol works (it sends packets verifying the receipt of data to prevent errors)."
