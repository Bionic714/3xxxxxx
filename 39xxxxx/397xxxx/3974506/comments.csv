,Denohn,2008-03-30T19:06Z,"""It wasn't detected before, but AVG seems to find a virus in the exe file now. The file is from the nocd crack used on the exe (figures =/), you can test this by using a copy of the 1.02 executable and applying the nocd crack, AVG goes berserk xD. Most of the torrent is good, but the crack and cracked exe seem to not be, so make sure you have AVG on hand ^_^ I think there's a no cd crack w/o any viruses, my computer doesn't seem to have any problem with it at least and ff7 is running with no disc. You can get a copy of it and the 1.02 patch at http://www.sendspace.com/file/ol9wqt while it's up there, or you can just search for the 1.02 patch and the crack named FinalFantasyVIIUniversalCrackLCG.zip on google ^_^"" I have a problem with it..When i go to another room/area the FF7 Crashes..Please help me . :P"
