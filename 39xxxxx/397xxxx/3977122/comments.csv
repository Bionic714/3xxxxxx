,rossi6969,2008-01-16T00:52Z,"Thank You for the uploads guys. Just starting with the karaoke downloads, so can anyone tell me where i might find the sound choice series at? Thanks Again for the great uploads "
,EzeRoss,2008-01-16T01:50Z,"Demonoid was the place to get all the Sound Choice discs, but now that they have been shut down. Maybe your best hope is here. If you go back to the Pioneer CDG Karaoke PI031 - PI040 upload you will see that Nicknacks offered to start uploading them and I certainly have about 40GB of them, but it could take a while. Is there anything in particular that you are looking for? As you can see I do requests when I can. Also is there anything that you can donate to the karaoke cause, we are all grateful for anything new or old.
Our little family is growing nicely and if you can find any of the old Demonoiders, they certainly could bring a lot to the party, especially the Sound Choice completion project as it used to known. Just found this site by Googling the name of one of the old team, try this. www.kingdomofkaraoke.co.uk
