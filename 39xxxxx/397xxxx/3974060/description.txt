Loveless is the second studio album by alternative rock band My Bloody Valentine. Released on 4 November 1991, Loveless was recorded over a two-year period between 1989 and 1991 in nineteen recording studios. Lead vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated the recording process; he sought to achieve a particular sound for the record, making use of various techniques such as guitars strummed with a tremolo bar, sampled drum loops, and obscured vocals. A large number of engineers were hired and fired during the process, although the band finally gave credit on the album sleeve to anyone who was present during the recordings, "even if all they did was make tea", according to Shields.[1] The recording of Loveless is rumored to have cost Â£250,000, a figure that came close to bankrupting the band's record label Creation Records.

My Bloody Valentine's relationship with Creation Records deteriorated during the album's recording, and the band was removed from the label due to the difficulty and expense of working with Shields. While the album was not a great commercial success, Loveless was well received by critics. The album is widely regarded as a landmark of the alternative rock genre, and is frequently cited by critics as one of the best albums of the 1990s. A number of My Bloody Valentine's contemporaries, including Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, have cited the album as an influence on their music.
