,Slashpirate,2008-01-17T06:54Z,It would've helped if this was labelled a 32bit version in the heading. Anyone got an oem ultimate version in 64bit form?

,kd233,2008-01-17T17:45Z,This WORKED! It worked for my laptop
,iveforgotmyname,2008-01-18T11:27Z,it will work on any pc that will run vista
,dvdpirate,2008-01-18T16:37Z,"SO uploader this has no 30-day activation? Cause I have already downloaded three different ""Dell-OEM""   versions. And all quit working after no activation within 30days. So does anyone who has installed this version have ""change product key"" next to their  key under the ""windows activation"" on the system window? If you do it will fail in 30-days??"
,iveforgotmyname,2008-01-19T22:09Z,this is pre activated you dont have to do anything apart from install it 
,iveforgotmyname,2008-01-19T22:12Z,it is cracked by showing vista a dell bios so that it thinks its on a dell pc. the only difference i have found is there is a second dely just before windows boots as it cracks it and it says dell in the welcome screen. im not sure how long ive had it installed but i will check and see if its been  more than 30 days
,solstice 1,2008-01-19T22:49Z,"I have just used microsoft genuine advantage and it says OK
I think this is the real thing
Many thanks  uploader"

,Faldune,2008-05-10T18:03Z,"I burned ISO file using Alcohol 120, but after burning, I'm supposed to restart my comp to do a clean install, but after I restart it just goes back to my desktop (like its not reading the dvd disk or something)??. It shows up in my disk drive, but when I double click the icon to start installing from the disk drive it tells me to restart comp from the disk to do a clean install, but when I restart it just goes back to my desktop again????. Can anyone HELP PLEASE!!."
,rrpostal,2008-06-12T06:57Z,"@Faldune
Do you have your bios set to BOOT from DVD drive. Seems kinda obvious if that's the problem."
