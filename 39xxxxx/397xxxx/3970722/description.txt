--- The series ---------------------------------------------------------------

--- The episode --------------------------------------------------------------

While driving a car with her husband Sean, the pregnant Naomi Randolph collapses and is moved to House's hospital. Edward Vogler is forcing the dismissal of House, pressing the board with his investment of one hundred million dollars in the hospital. The team finds that Naomi has small-cell lung cancer, needing to be submitted to radiation, but she refuses the caesarean section and the treatment to give a better chance of survival to the baby. Meanwhile, the baby of a young couple is losing weight, and House finds that the baby is being fed by the vegetarian parents only with a vegan diet. The direction of the hospital calls the social service and the police and the parents are arrested. 

While House and his team scramble to discover what's causing brain and kidney dysfunction in a pregnant woman, Vogler is on the warpath to get House fired. Clinic Cases: Baby girl Olive Kaplan has pneumonia from vegan parents feeding him a vegetarian diet. After the baby starts getting better, Cuddy gets the parents arrested for starving their child.

--- Why this torrent? -------------------------------------------------------

First of all, I didn't make this file but I downloaded it from someone else. 
But like a lot of TV series and movies on this site (and others) it was zipped or 
rarred and like most of you I find that very annoying. 
So I made this torrent with the unzipped content and uploaded it here.

There will probably be more....
