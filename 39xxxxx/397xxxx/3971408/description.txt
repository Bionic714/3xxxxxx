This is a copy of the Anachronox Machinima DVD - originally created by former members of Ion Storm before the studio went out of business, re-hosted here for all to watch.

The story follows Sylvester 'Sly' Boots, a down-on-his-luck detective who stumbles onto his biggest case ever - saving the universe from an evil force bent on its destruction.

This DVD contains nearly every cut scene from the game, strung together to tell the story for those who cannot or haven't the time to play it. The movie is funny, smart, and unique - one of the best Machinima movies of all time.
