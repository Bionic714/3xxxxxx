This is the actual suicide of Ricardo Lopez, who was an obsessed stalker of artist Bjork. Lopez commited suicide September 12, 1996 after mailing a acid spraying bomb intened for Bjork.

This is part of a 18 hour video diary that Lopez had been keeping. There is a DVD box set of the complete diary that I\'m looking into getting and ripping to share.
