,Caerroil,2008-03-26T19:55Z,Don't know. Try a search on Google or Wikipedia.
,makkyb,2008-04-04T19:21Z,Nice!! My DVD renting place only got the first volume and he didn't get the second as he said that the first had compleatly 'failed' in his shop.  He said that i was the only one to ever rent it lol!!

,tobbe401,2008-07-09T01:37Z,is it swedish subs or swedish language in this??
,VicVega,2008-07-13T05:15Z,It's a kids' show with simplified English - who needs subs? I think you'll understand it if you just give it a try.
,Xziliate,2008-07-15T01:26Z,how many parts are there?
,mazureac,2008-07-31T22:58Z,there are 2 parts. this year they remake this story in a 3d animation :)
,SanPablo,2008-08-18T07:02Z,"yeah.  who needs subs?  um, maybe ppl who dont speak english?

wait.  maybe if you slowed the audio down and made it louder... like it was somebody yelling it at you slowly.  i bet that would make it understandable.

for example, everybody knows that if you dont speak japanese and someone just talks LOUDER and more SLOWLY, you can understand every word."
,giggedyguy,2008-08-27T14:22Z,George Lucas can such my Wookie Balls!
,Mazin_Z,2008-08-30T00:27Z,sucks-.- I hate cartoon!
,crystaldream717,2008-08-30T10:41Z,endor is not the wookie's home!
,sobs,2008-10-07T21:43Z,"ok..warning *geek debate coming*

You're right they do not come from Endor, but Lucas originally planned it that way. He said he couldnt make the wookie world earlier because of the technology back in the days werent good enough."
,sgthartman1,2008-10-14T22:46Z,actually and correct me if im wrong here your mom is from endor
,Lathlas,2009-03-07T16:12Z,"This was REALLY hard to find. I had to slog through the terrible ""THE Clone Wars"" torrents to find the good one."
,Tychob,2009-11-01T15:57Z,"so is this the version made by tartatovski?
the samurai jack guy?"
,asole,2010-01-01T04:00Z,"Yes, it's ""Clone Wars (2003)"". NOT ""THE Clone Wars (2008)""."
,senorfrog,2010-07-20T02:20Z,"lol @ sanpablo

thanks for upping this caerroil.  like somebody else pointed out, i had to sift through a ton of the 2008 ""the clone wars"" videos to find it"
