,chimpakawanzelu,2008-04-09T07:25Z,"HELP.  All of these avi files are the incorrect aspect ration (at least on my computer - Vista 32bit; Windows Media Player v11).  They appear to be3:4 instead  of 4:3.  They're compressed horizontally.  Tried changing the aspect ratio in the media player, but no luck.

Anyone else having this problem??  Or know how to fix it??  Thanks."
