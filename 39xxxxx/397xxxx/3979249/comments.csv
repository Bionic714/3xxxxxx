,BakuninXL,2008-01-16T12:59Z,Sweden may not be a democracy but the country still offers more freedom than larger European states like GB and Germany for example! The little freedom you still have is more than what most of your greater neighbors enjoy!
,[VI]Lenin,2008-03-09T04:30Z,"OK killawife FIRST off Sweeden IS one of the most socialistic governments in Europe. (which is why they don't have the copyright laws the US does). Communism is a theory of socialism but they're not two distinctly different things. The European Union is a CONFEDERATION (like the South tried to be), the United States a Federalist state not a confederation. While Russia and China were dictatorial states they were socialistic which is the OPPOSITE of a facist state. Your worst mistake of all...while the US is hardly an ideal in the past hundred years it's undergone a rapid decentrilization, implemented ever policy underlined in the Communist Manifesto, has placed more power in the hands of the people...which is why they elected an alcoholic with barely any government expierience over an oscar-winning visionary."
,[VI]Lenin,2008-03-09T04:31Z,"Now, what else did you get wrong..."
,[VI]Lenin,2008-03-09T04:32Z,"Oh yeah, Communism is an oligarchy which aims to make all citizen equal and Nazism was a dictatorship which singled out minorities."
,rockstar11998,2008-05-09T08:05Z,"BakuninXL - I know you aren't American or English.  If you are from a democratic state then don't project your countries problems on the United States.  Your grammar is poor in the typed parts.  I know you have no clue what capitalism is really about.  There has to be guidelines or the economy will crash.  I like having my government control certain aspects of the economy.  There are a lot of loonies out there that could easily run our economy into the ground if there weren't these sorts of safeguards in place.
I suggest no one should watch this.  All it did is make me dumber.  It is just some lame conspiracy theory film about how capitalism is just like Socialism - which it isn't at all.  It may have a few similarities - which are needed - but the bottom line and goals are totally different.  This guy must never have taken a real economics course in his whole life.
I do agree that the European Union may not be a good thing for Europe.  There are elements to it that are going to hurt the general public in the long run.
Killawife - first off that name tells me your a complete idiot and that you have no life or wife.  Secondly, you haven't a clue about the History of the United States if you believe we have no real democracy.  The democratic process has been altered to make it more feasible but our officials are elected and can be taken out any time we feel the need.  This is all a part of the Constitution if you'd care to read it some time.  I taught U.S. Government so don't try to B.S. me with nonsense.  I do know that slowly certain aspects of democracy are deteriorating but it's certainly not as bad as you are thinking it is.  The whole world is going down the tubes so don't just pick on Capitalism because it's not about the form of government you'll be living under that you'll have to worry about.  It will be the religious leadership that will be of most concern soon."
,keiron80,2008-06-06T08:48Z,"Communism, Socialism, and Capitalism are just variants of hierarchical structures.

In each case power flows (or doesn't) based on decisions made at the top.

What is needed is a more inclusive approach where you and I and everyone else are able to decide together.   This would be a true democracy.  Representative ""democracy"" and parliamentary ""democracy"" are facades - and neoliberalism has only made this more apparent.

Whether you call it Direct Democracy, Participatory Democracy, or Inclusive Democracy (Takis Fotopolous of Greece has written extensively on Inclusive Democracy) it just makes more sense.

Whenever power is concentrated, those who love power seek it and abuse it.   Whenever power is diffuse those who love people and life will prevail.

It's high time we created the society we want, rather than waiting on those who destroy the Earth through actually-existing capitalism."
,keiron80,2008-06-06T09:17Z,"Oh - Rockstar1198, if you can take your elected officials out any time, would you please remove Bush, Cheney, and the rest?

They are working with the IMF and WTO to sanction states, economic genocide, who do not worship the ""free"" market.

They invaded two sovereign nations because 3000 of your citizens died on 9/11, and since then 4000 of your citizens have died in war, and up to 500 000 non-combatant, civilian Iraqis.

They torture people, ignore international law, refuse to sign on to the ICC, exempt mass murderers from their for-profit militia Blackwater from prosecution for slaughter of civilians, and have made the world a much less safe place.

If you can take them out at any time - why haven't you?   Your democracy isn't what you think it is.

I'm not an American, but I feel sad for the average American citizen who is suffering under the tyranny of George Bush et al.

I am, however a Canadian, and well educated also - so you can't single me out as an an uneducated foreigner.   And no - the parliamentary ""democracy"" we have up here is not real either - Harper bows down and stands up to shake the hands of the IMF/WTO and Bush often enough he surely suffers dizzy spells.

But yes - if you can get rid of your elected officials any time you want - please do it now, the rest of the world will thank you. 

Peace & Love,

[T],CaptOmerta,2008-06-16T16:04Z,"The word ""Democracy"" is not written ONE time in the US Constitution.

The ORIGINAL United States Republic, is the best government this world has ever seen.

But, we are turning Socialist, that means...disarming the public, which will lead to tyranny.
Fools who give up their guns deserve to be slaves, and are, because they let someone be their king, and tell them how and what they are allowed to do. "

i believe you are eating your words as i speak.

btw your list of grievances is really a load of nonsense.  what does the EU do when things like sudan genocide happen?  it sits on its hands and cries about it. a very low cost low effort response while trying to remain on its high horse. you see this all over the place, complain complain, accuse, but never ever intervene.  its fun calling bush unethical, but well the europeans hardly ever look at themselves.  the reality is they take the position that best preserves their bubble of peace while pretending they care about the world more than everyone else.  the hatred of bush is just a useful diversion.

the eu is pretty damn undemocratic, thats for sure. pointing at bush was another way to divert attention while the eu expanded undemocratic its power."
,w000ter,2008-12-13T02:41Z,"canada and the uk have allowed for the existence of sharia courts already.  luckily the us will never allow this.  many progressives have lost their way, stabbing themselves in the back.  these types are strongest in places that spend their time pointing fingers at bush oddly enough"
,nilbud,2009-09-15T06:45Z,"Oh fuck. Another pigfucking dummy. Look at the braindead american cocksuckers squawking away trying to defend their shitty corrupt little warcrime factory. There's even a monobrow burbling sewage about the fucking constitution. What an ignorant bastard.

The us is a criminal conspiracy which just coughed out it's financial death rattle. The dumb uneducated opinionated imbeciles which inhabit that polluted desert of a place are living jokes. Die you worthless fucking spackheads."
,Tukotih,2009-12-17T18:03Z,Nazism = Fucking extreme capitalism but still has the touch of government power which can be found in communistic countries.
,Exodus666,2010-01-12T19:02Z,"@CaptOmerta: Right, because ur president/king doesn't get full autonomous power during wartime... Oh wait he does.
At least u elected him from a wide range of political ideologies... no.. wait, u live in a two party-dictatorship still clinging to an archaic political structure. Yes the founding fathers created a good society AT THAT TIME, if u take any of their ideology and try to apply it today it will only come out as socialism."
,Dadutta,2010-02-21T19:14Z,THANKS - God bless Capitalism and may He curse all communists
,TheMatsjo,2010-03-10T12:30Z,"@Killawife: While you're correct that what happened in Russia wasn't socialism, it wasn't communism either. It was state capitalism, where istead of corporations owning the means of production, the state did.

@BakuninXL: I'll watch the documentary, but sociailism is not totalitarian. I agree that the EU is not a democracy however; prosperity in capitalist regimes only exist on the basis of the exploitation of its people. "
