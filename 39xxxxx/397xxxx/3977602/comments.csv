Great flick! I watched it back2back with 'Enemy at the gates'. Thanks!"
,Alpha999,2009-12-10T01:03Z,"thx, great rip.

be advised this movie sucks: completly wrong, unrealistic and full of war cliches, combat scenes are patetic
its a 2h patriotism/nationalism overload + emo family interludes (and those realy sucks),

try Platoon or hamburger hill instead"
,tuffscout,2010-01-02T22:17Z,"alpha999: interesting. You must be awesome and all-knowing. omnipresent and all that.

But yeah. What do Vietnam Vets know? :)

Thanks kirklestat!"
,Alpha999,2010-01-04T01:06Z,"No, not yet...but iam trying :)

anyway, tuffscout,  i wouldnt believe all those inevitable ""Iam a viet vet and this is it"" fake promo comercials, hell, even I can write one if i want.  

Just observe how the soldiers move & shoot:
NVA/VC = indians
US = John Wayne & co.
Just lame, pls can some REAL vet comment if this is how real soldiers act in a firefight?
i had great expectations about this movie, went to the theatre and at the end I was  like WTF???  "
,healer900,2010-02-04T23:13Z,"Audio was good. Video quality was great. Overall, the movie was pretty good. Thanks kirklestat."
,isura,2010-03-09T06:07Z,"Nice Work, Seed & Enjoy...!"
,tgoodin,2010-03-16T22:54Z,"Alpha999, if you are trying to get any idea of what actual combat is like, or was like, you won't find it in a Hollywood movie. The best place is in country, but if you don't like the idea of being shot at, look up some war documentaries, some have actual combat footage.

The movie isn't great, but it's not garbage. I've seen plenty of bad war movies."
