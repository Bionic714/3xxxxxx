,be291055,2008-01-11T22:05Z,These are great. Thank you. Please keep them coming. Any chance of reseeding 101 - 112. I came late to the party.
[T],flixer,2008-01-12T04:19Z,"The earlier episodes are on mininova. Problem is they were tracked by demonoid so they're running on dht, peer exchange, and the trackers added by isohunt. IsoHunt is good for checking number of seeds and what trackers they're on. Let me know how it goes. :)"
