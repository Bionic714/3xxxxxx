,tfly,2008-01-12T05:04Z,"I have no runways or taxiways.  All the buildings are there, just no asphalt."
,KingMusjo,2008-01-12T21:18Z,"Weird... actually i'm having the same problem! I don't understand this... I also have the same issue with Blueprint's KMSP...

If anyone has a solution for this - please let me know! :)"
,KingMusjo,2008-01-12T21:24Z,"Allright!!! I've found a solution - at least I think... You need to download concrete textures from Blueprint Simulations homepage download section! 

Anyway - here's a link:

,palmofsweden,2008-01-14T20:34Z,"Actually no, this one costs about 15$."
,tfly,2008-01-15T05:02Z,Nope.  Downloading and installing the textures from the website still result in no asphalt being displayed at the airport
,tfly,2008-01-16T18:53Z,"How about a rip?  Other that that possibility, this torrent is useless."
,tfly,2008-03-03T00:35Z,"If you previously used the Simflyers IAD scenery, open your scenery.cfg file with notepad and search for ""Exclude=N38 59 08 27,W77 30 19 13,N38 54 46 73,W77 25 36 20,all""

Delete that line and the flatten entry below it."
