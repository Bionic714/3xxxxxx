This is a concert that was recorded for a live radio broadcast on WMMR in Philadelphia. It is my understanding that this was the first time they have done this since the 80's. While the quality isn't that of a usual live CD performance I think you will find that considering the way that this was recorded, the quality is very good. 

I urge you guys to leave comments and let me know what you think about the torrents that I upload, so please don't hesitate to do so.
