This release, and my others (Objective Burma, Never So Few, Where Eagles Dare, and 13 Rue Madeleine) are in honor of the OSS and America's Special Operations Forces who have a rich and entertaining history which has profound philosophical implications on American foreign policy today. Props to the SOE folks as well!
