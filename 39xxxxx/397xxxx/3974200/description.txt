Biography : Likened early on to being Nico And The Velvet Underground meets My Bloody Valentine, Amsterdam's Nightblooms are a remarkable group. Their single "Butterfly Girl" was widely regarded as one of the most unusual singles ever released. One pre-eminent journalist wrote, "'Butterfly Girl' is one of the most enchanting and unnerving songs I've heard in years," and another wrote, "My heart broke the first time I heard it, and again every time thereafter." Their debut album with its mix of unearthly songs in spookily pretty sound-around and sudden tidal attacks of guitar, single-handedly debunked the shoegazer "phenomena" on which tail-end it arrived and highlighted its underwhelming mix of feyness and ambient drone. Their second album takes things inspiredly further, so imagine if you will, that the Sundays gatecrashing Led Zeppelin's rehearsal room.
