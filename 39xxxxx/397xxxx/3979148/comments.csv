,Deznaj,2008-01-16T09:26Z,"135 MB for a 4 issue limited series??? That's called overkill. 20MB for one issue is more than enough. Check the ""DCP-bible"" on how to scan and edit properly.

I'll pass, thank you."
[V],joshua13,2008-01-16T09:31Z,"wow. - he never said he scanned them, yet you attack him for it. You publicly criticize whoever the scanner is -  bad form in general in most of the comics world 
hawley griffen - ignore him, and thanks for posting.

[T],splattergod,2008-01-30T19:53Z,"hawley-griffen, thanks for this, and in such good quality too.Deznaj, what exactly is your problem?
You seem to post your unwanted opinions on every single comic upload.
""DCP-bible""? Give me a fucking break.
Not everyone is some anal-retentive scene wanker trying to get ""scene points"".
Some actually upload just to be cool and share.
Why not scan and upload something yourself, to demonstrate the proper technique?
No, you've only upped one thing...
someone else's work...lazy whiny fuck!
Complaining about good quailty? The size?
Not all of us have a Compaq w/ a teeny 10G hard drive, so most will not find a torrent of 135 mb very big..probably are still running Windows 3.1 too, you loser.
You have to be the biggest idiot on TPB.
You and your little scene kiddies can go blow a petrified gopher's cock!"
