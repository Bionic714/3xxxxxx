CNCat 2.1 was the last freeware, unDRMed, High Quality Web Directory Script, which also had 

a search function and you can modify what the links look like, or other stuff in the admin 

section, that was until they came out with version 3.0 and started charging.

I then noticed with 4.0 they were giving CNCat Free again, YAY! :) (sarcasm) Except....... 

they DRMed it to where you have to prove your not commercial, you have to tell them what 

domain your gonna use it on, So NO using CNCat if you have two domains like My-Non-Profit-

Site.com and My-Non-Profit-Site.org.

Now CNCAT is encrypted so your can't modify the script to your needs, or if theres a bug, 

it's all encrypted, overpriced, DRM piece of crap.

Thtas the reason I am giving out their old free version is because, (1)I don't like DRM 

crap, (2)I am not making money and will refuse to be a servant to CN-Software.com, (3) This 

is NOW considered Abandonware and the LFL (last Freeware Left), (4) I don't think their 

gonna sue or track down people who use their older free scripts with less features, (5) No 

other script works to my needs as CNCat 2.1 did, (6) They went commercial because no 

appreicated their script, well I did, and it doesn't mean I'm gonna pay big bucks for DRM 

CRAP.

To fight CN-Software for their DRM move, contact them telling them you won't accept their 

DRM infested software, even if you were rich, and contact your Senators/Congressman asking 

them to make DRM practices illegal then expose CNCAT as DRM controlled.
