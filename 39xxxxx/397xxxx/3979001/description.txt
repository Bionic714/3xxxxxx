It was the first kungfu film to have been made by a major Hollywood studio and was produced in association with Golden Harvest and Lee\'s Concord Production Company. The film is largely set in Hong Kong.

Among the stuntmen for the film were members of the Seven Little Fortunes, including Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. This was arguably instrumental in Chan and Hung\'s further association with Golden Harvest studios, which later launched their careers. The portly Hung is shown fighting Lee in the opening sequence of the movie.

The finished version of the film was significantly different from the original screenplay drafts as Bruce Lee revised much of the script himself, including having written and directed the films opening Shaolin Temple fight sequence. Lee wanted to use the film as a vehicle for expressing what he saw as the beauty of his Chinese culture, rather than it being just another action movie[citation needed].

The Warner Brothers Special 25th Anniversary Edition DVD includes footage from the only surviving TV interview of Bruce Lee (which aired on December 9, 1971 with Canadian journalist Pierre Burton) Also included in this special DVD release are a few minutes of added movie footage which is philosophical in tone, but was cut from the original theatrical release. In addition, there is a good amount of behind the scenes footage and extensive interview segments on various topics about Lee by his widow Linda Lee Caldwell.
