I'm not a cyber wiz kid, but I'd watch those trackers, just in case. Strangely enough, the infamous and much maligned denisstalker was not on any of my offenses.

Cheers"

,Draconicus,2008-02-28T07:21Z,Err - seeding. I meant seeding. >.>
,Draconicus,2008-03-02T02:25Z,"FINAL COMMENT:
Tried to watch this in sync with a friend who had the DVD. Kept going out of sync. This file plays considerably faster than the actual film - probably because of compression. This doesn't do anything to the viewing quality - it plays great, but it should be noted."
