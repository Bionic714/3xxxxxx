--- The series ---------------------------------------------------------------

The series follows the life of anti-social, pain killer addict, witty and arrogant medical doctor Gregory House with only half a muscle in his right leg. He and his team of medical doctors try to cure very ill ordinary people in the United States of America.


--- The episode --------------------------------------------------------------

House apparently triggers a stroke in a clinic patient, but the major topic of discussion is House's imminent date with Cameron. The team must deal with the patient's odd lifestyle, overbearing "friend", and reluctant parents in order to stop the strokes and try to save his life.

--- Why this torrent? -------------------------------------------------------

First of all, I didn't make this file but I downloaded it from someone else. 
But like a lot of TV series and movies on this site (and others) it was zipped or 
rarred and like most of you I find that very annoying. 
So I made this torrent with the unzipped content and uploaded it here.

There will probably be more....
