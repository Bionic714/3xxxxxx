,darkness418,2008-01-14T16:26Z,thx for the add...got anymore...classic material here
,mistertpitydafoo,2008-01-14T17:10Z,"Yeah i do have a lot more. And I have some rare ones such as Sword and the Lute and Kiss of Death, along with vcd of Ghost Eyes and Angel Strikes Back. Still can't find Lost Souls which was another rare request by someone else. I am just nervous about uploading them, because so far I have uploaded about 20 films and it hasn't convinced anyone to either do private trading with me, or to at least start a trend of other Fu flicks being uploaded. Short of Jameskees who already had it on lock before I showed up here, no ones uploading any Fu flicks or Shaw films. I have another 26 dvds on the way in the mail so I have a lot to offer, but it's feeling one sided. It would be nice to double my collection or at least have some others added. Each of these films I pay more than $10 for, plus the oop ones such as The Kiss of Death I paid $31.00 with shipping for it. I don't mind sharing and spreading but I keep getting requests but nothing in return. Yes I do have Vengeance and Boxer From Shantung to the person who asked me about those two, plus the One Armed Swordsman and The New One Armed Swordsman. My question is, for those of you who have requests, if you can offer me at least one quality download of a Shaw Brothers film that I can add to my collection or want tomake backup copies of dvds and trade through the mail as I have done with music cds. Hit me up, if someone just hooks me up with a single movie I don't have, I will do requests for you and everything. My collection is pushing 200 right now and steadily growing (along with probably 500 downloaded ones , a lot are in rmvb format though, I'm trying to get dvd quality stuff because I like quality instead of speed and quantity) so I would be a valuable trading ally. My next upload will be The Shadow Whip or Opium and the Kung Fu Master. It will be up within 24 hrs. Enjoy and thanks to all who seed. I promise to upload more films and I hope it can convince someone else to start sharing their collection! "

,svartevarg,2008-01-17T10:40Z,"I would like to join private trade dear master...but i have only 4 Shaw Bros Flickz by IVL/Celestial,those released for Greek Region...I have some VCD(a few downloaded non-greek) releases like Lost Souls...e.t.c...
All others are 230 XviD Flickz by SBunite, YYddr, BloodweiseR.....etc..
I would like to upload flickz but i don't have the opportunity to keep seeding 'cause i don't have my own internet connection for now...
.................
As for SB Flickz i prefer them in Quality too...
For other non-SB flicks like the ones jameskees uploaded speed is what matters more...
...........

After the unexpected death of Demonoid...It's cool that you are here to share without payback...Thou helped me upgrade my collection in terms of quality.... 
Please keep the effort ALIVE...
'cause some of us here love Kung Fu..

Thank You for all the hard work you have done..."
,PervyWota,2008-01-27T07:44Z,"this is my only access to quality kung-fu flicks, since I don't have paypal and live in the sticks, so thank you very much for upping the kung fu that you have...been looking for this off-and-on for a quite a few years, so big ups to you!  I'll be keeping this in seed for awhile for sure!"
,donraju,2008-02-05T09:41Z,"i got some sbunite 1-cd rips, wud any1 like them? also, mpdafoo, u got vengeance and boxer from shantung?"

,eddie27320,2008-06-04T00:25Z,Please seed please
,theloner81,2008-12-16T05:15Z,"I waited all day for this piece of shit, and when I finally get it, it won't play in anything but DIVX even though I have all the codecs,then when it plays THERE'S NO FUCKING SOUND. mistertpitydafoo, your a bitch for even posting this sorry ass shit!!!!!!"
,TheFuManChu,2009-02-16T23:17Z,Thank you Mr. T
,Stangho,2010-02-03T11:38Z,"  Thank you very much for uploading all of these great Shaw Brothers films. I have a decent collection going on DVD, but I can only afford to buy the very top films - that is the top ones I can find..  I have seen ""Liquid Swords"" , ""Faster Blade, Poisonous Darts"" online, but still haven't found ""Method Man (exact title?) which I have never seen, or ""Ghost Face Killer"" (wrong title, whatever it is I had it years ago on bootleg VHS labeled ""Ghostface Killer""
     I would really love to have each of these as well as good old ""Return to the 36 Chambers"" - another one I had on VHS in college 10 years ago but was borrowed/stolen/idk.  I can't seem to find a torrent for that comedic follow-up to the original. I love it for it's comedy and the kung fu which is arguably better than any found in the ""The 36 Chambers of Shaolin"".  Even if the Method Man and Ghostface ""related"" (Shaw films from which the Wu-Tang Clan hip-hop group found their names) are not the best to add to my collection, I still would very much like to have them for the novelty I suppose. From what I recall however, the film in which the ""Ghostface(d)? Killer"" is a character was a good one. I recall him leaving his calling cards if you will on the bodies of those he killed, and a few other elements. It was college, the screenings of these filims was always in a very smoky room, and my memory of the details just isn't the best. 
    If you could suggest the top Shaw films to get in your  opinion I would very much appreciate the input. Upping some of those would be great as well , of course. Perhaps that is what you are doing now, of course...upping the ones you feel are some of the best. But if you haven't upped some because they are ""must haves"" that most enthusiats DO have, please remind me of the titles. I have seen parts of Faster Blade, but never any of the first Liquid Swords or the other(s)? 

    Thanks Again, By the Way, this is the only public stuff I Make a POINT of seeding- I know we are trying to help one another out here , to get our collections built up. So I will continue to seed this stuff as much as possible. I watched ""Legendary Weapons of China"" last night and it was great. Is there another film with a similar name, because I recall RZA mentioning in the commentary for 36 Chambers a film that showcased the 18 Shaolin weapons. i think the film he was referencing was more recent though. 

   Get Back to me on those questions and list of must haves  when you can - it will be much appreciated. 
Everyone please SEED- these torrents really need everyone seeding...set a limit for each torrents upload speed if you must, that's what I do sometimes to make sure I am still helping out, even if its only 10kb/s- or even less. It all adds up , of course. "
