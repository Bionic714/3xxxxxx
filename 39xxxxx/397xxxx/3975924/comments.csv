this works only when you type FAST and make sure you changed keysettings ""r"" button (replay button) 
this must be changed otherwise it starts a replay as soon as you pressed ""r"" . ;)"

I Have Windows 7...

Any Help Plz..."
,Gladiatorvok,2011-03-12T15:57Z,"It's a very great game, so thanks for uploadin! But it has 2 bugs.
1st: for windows 7 you must get a newer Tages SA version, because otherwise it won'T works. You can get it here: http://www.tagesprotection.com/main.htm?page=minimum.htm
2nd: at Missin ""Undercover"" in the first challange you have to do some jumps, but the counter is already at the start of the race has been set to 12/18 and it won't increases, so I'm stuck with the game."
