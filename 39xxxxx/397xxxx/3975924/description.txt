make sure to read the "how-to-use.txt". 
even noobs should be able to handle this 3 step guide for DT+mini.

and more to read ( i know 90% dont do!, i call them "boneheads" btw.)


S p e c i a l   I n f o   N o t e :

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of a packed .exe, such as

the "Alarm-Launcher.exe" as a lame virus, the reason for this is simple

its the byte by byte check "error" of some "cheap'n'stupid" virus-tools.

Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics,

you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!.

(see heuristics). more questions about ? see below...

this site has been created especially for all haters, non-believers, 
wanna be's and ofcourse for those people who keep reporting shit
about my uploads, the so called "boneheads", who dont have a life.
or who probably never saw a pussy in real life... dunno exactly!.
anyway from PC lock-ups to illegal operations, Internet Explorer
crashes, slow-downs, and other frustrations, many problems purely
and simply come down to what is running in the background on your 
PC and currently demanding attention by the computer. if you could 
take a minute to think about, then you'll make me just real Happy ;) . 

>>>  thank you for reading!. ;)
