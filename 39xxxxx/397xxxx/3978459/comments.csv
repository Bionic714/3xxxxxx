,UXO_MOXY,2008-02-08T11:40Z,I need seed.. 
,pmcx,2009-04-19T01:39Z,"The odd numbering is a mess. I believe the one set up to 250 is '250 top hits of the 1990s' which exists in other torrents.  The remaining 150 are the 2000-2005 songs. 

Separating the two might have been better, but thanks. (But have to see if anyone seeds)"
