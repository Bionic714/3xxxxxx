,hardhitter2805,2008-08-09T08:54Z,Can you upload some more games like naruto and marvel games?
,DerStadtschutz,2008-10-07T03:25Z,"The Crash Bandicoot Collection is just that... a collection. It contains the first 3 in the series. No crash bash or crash team racing, though. 

To Gelia: if it says you're missing a .dll file, try searching google for that .dll, and it should work fine. 

And finally, to Elliot_Moose, Thank you for uploading this. Every PSX upload I try to find is a PBP and in PAL format, so I can't play it on my PlayStation. I've been meaning to try Megaman Legends for a long time now, but for some reason the N64 emulator I have doesn't like to display most of the video for that game... Now I have a chance.  Thank you so much. "
