Overview:	The dying master of the powerful Poison Clan dispatches his last pupil on a crucial mission. Worried that the skills he has taught are being used to evil ends, he orders the Yan Tieh to trace a retired colleague and warn him that the fortune he amassed from the clan activities is under threat from five of his former pupils. Each an expert in his own lethal combat style, The Centipede, The Snake, The Scorpion, The Lizard, and The Toad comprise a truly invincible force. Yan must discover the whereabouts and true identities of these deadly masked warriors, and decide which, if any, he can trust to join him in his perilous mission. A blindingly choreographed blend of intrigue and violence, "Five Deadly Venoms" adds a truly original dimension to the kung fu genre.
