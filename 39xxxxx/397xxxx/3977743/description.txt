In 2000 the Finnish band Excalion was founded by Jarmo \\\"Jappe\\\" 
Myllyvirta (keyboardist), Henri Pirkkalainen (drums), and Tero Vaaja 
(bass guitar). They began by playing cover songs of Stratovarius and 
Nightwish. In 2005 they released their first album Primal Exhale. After 
some changes in the line-up - Jarmo Pakkonen (vocals) and Veso Nupponen 
(Guitar) joined the band - Excalion was ready to write the second album: 
Waterlines. 

This album contains eleven songs that vary between power metal and epic 
metal. Especially Pakkonen makes a huge impression with his powerful 
metal voice, because whether he sings ballads or fast songs, he has a 
great throat. The album starts like a typical metal album with the 
up-tempo Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã?Â¤The WingmanÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã?Â¤, a standard melodic power metal song. Next, 
Excalion shows their real power with symphonic power metal songs 
Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã?Â¤Streams of MadnessÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã?Â¤ and Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã?Â¤Soaking GroundÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã?Â¤, the progressive influenced 
`Ivory Tower\\\', `I failed for you\\\', `Between the Lines\\\', and the power 
ballad `Delta Sunrise\\\'. The final song is the Finnish `Yovartio\\\', a song 
especially for their Finnish fans. 

Excalion is more than a simple copy of Stratovarius or Nightwish. With 
the progressive and symphonic elements Waterlines makes a great power 
metal album. Add the really terrific vocals and the crystal clear 
production to the songs and you get an album that has to be part of 
every melodic power metal collection. So, to all melodic power metal 
fans: Check out this album!
