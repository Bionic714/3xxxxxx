Blake Shelton has proven his country roots by staying true to form with his style of music. Each CD he's released has had a unique blend of ballads, outlaw, honkeytonk, thought-provoking, and just downright fun, music. Each CD gets better and better. He's very possibly the best kept secret in country music - and while he's successful, he's not beholden to the powers of the industry to change like other artists have been.
