Silence the foe is an alternative band from Norway. This torrent contains their debut album shaking hallelujah and some things i downloaded from ur√∏rt. 

Buy their album from either http://www.silencethefoe.com/ or platekompaniet. Genius music, support these guys. Also brilliant cover art, so its actually worth buying just for that.

I will seed this torrent until around 30 users have downloaded, then it is up to you to keep this torrent alive. Help keeping good music available for free, keep seeding.

If this works well, more releases of good norwegian music will come, so you better keep seeding!

If you enjoyed this release, please support the artist by either purchasing the record or donating money right to the artist. They need our support!
