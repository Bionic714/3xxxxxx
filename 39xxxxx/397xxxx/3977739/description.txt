QUEEN OF SWORDS 3-4

103. FEVER   (10/21/2000)
When a deadly fever grips the town, Doctor Helm's medicine is the only cure. In an ambitious bid to assume power, Captain Grisham steals the antidote, which Montoya desperately needs, and frames the Queen of Swords for the crime. The dark beauty is forced to unmask the real culprit ? or watch Marta, Montoya and many of the townspeople die.

104. VENGEANCE  (10/28/2000)
An assassin disrupts the Harvest Festival, when his crossbow fells Don Aguilera, the father of Tessa's childhood friend, Ramon. The grief-stricken son swears vengeance, which Tessa more than understands ? until she, as the Queen of Swords, discovers that the shooter's target was not Don Aguilera, but Dr. Robert Helm. It seems that the good doctor has his fair share of secrets, too. Intrigued, the Queen tries to protect Helm, and finds herself caught between Montoya and a range war.
