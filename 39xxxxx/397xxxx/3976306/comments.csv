,Gsusnme,2008-01-14T17:29Z,"Big fan of the Evil Dead movies, Army of Darkness and all that jazz. But this has to be one of the silliest/weirdest things I have ever seen. To each his own then eh? I won't be seeding..."
,HIS_X,2008-01-17T16:50Z,"Gsusnme, If you were a true Evil dead fan..you would enjoy this just as much as i did. Great Upload!"
,Garockk,2008-02-01T15:26Z,"Thanks so much for this, I've seen it live and it's the bloodiest musical ever !"
,Hellmark,2008-03-16T17:54Z,"Whether you like it or not, you should seed, atleast to a 1:1 ratio."
,dark_justice1986,2008-03-30T11:57Z,I loved the evil dead movies and my fiance loves musicals so this should be a treat for both of us in a way.. I will seed this for awhile after it's done.
,thingf1sh,2008-04-02T20:27Z,"this is one of the funniest things I've ever seen, especially pointing out the inconsistences in the films pity about pic quality and watermark but well worth the download thank you so goddamn much"
,styxxx80,2008-05-06T18:53Z,"i saw this live, and it was awsome, though there are some big differences from the video and the show i saw"
,Drallz,2009-02-05T03:20Z,Please Seed...
,graveworld,2009-06-01T08:00Z,Very curious to see this as I am a big fan of the Evil Dead Trilogy. i'll seed it too. Thanks squishybanana!
,graveworld,2009-06-02T08:41Z,WARNING: This video has a water mark across the screen the whole time. Would have been nice to see that mentioned in the description.
,evilof,2009-11-27T00:41Z,"What's worse than the bad quality of the video is the bad quality of the audio. Kinda ruins some of the moments when realy high volumes kinda ""crack"". Still I've seen it a few times now. fun stuff and some realy catcy tunes"
,Akaziel,2010-07-09T10:27Z,"Given that this was never OFFICIALLY released, and this is a copy of a copy of a copy of a promotional video (hence the \""NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION\"" message), I\'ll take what I can get.  I\'ve been listening to this soundtrack for three years and never been able to actually see the show, so I\'m thankful for what I get!  I will totally seed this!"
,-Ronin-,2011-10-19T10:14Z,"Thanks SOOOOO much! I totally have wanted to see this, but it has NEVER come to town. Please Seed. :)"
