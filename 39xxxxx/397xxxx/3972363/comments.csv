,Shadowking,2008-01-13T15:14Z,What software did you use to convert the .mkv into an ISO-image?
,Grandpopus,2008-01-13T16:53Z,I think its first converted to VOB and then to iso.
,kornchild2002,2008-01-18T22:51Z,This is not 720p.  Both VLC and WMP report the resolution as being 720X480 which is pretty much the same resolution as the DVD release.  Don't waste your time with this download.  Not only did it take 4 days to get here (I seeded to a share ratio of near 2.0 as well) but it isn't even HD as said in the title.
,n1ce_hat,2008-01-20T18:21Z,"I cannot believe I actually wasted my bandwidth on this.  You can't possibly expect to get 720p out of that file format.  Boo!

Its clear though, certainly enjoyable."
,leesirc2002,2008-01-27T06:29Z,"Hey buddy, I would like to at least thank you for trying to get a blue-ray quality video out there. I'll still give it a try and see for my self. Did anyone actually try mounting it and extracting directly to the computer to watch? Maybe there is some quality reduction between swapping medias?"
,catmotorhead,2008-04-01T00:16Z,dvds may not be 720 or 1080 but that is why we buy upconverter dvd players and HDMI hook ups right???? Will any of these downloads ever be 720 or 1080 or what
,dcxero,2009-06-01T02:00Z,"For all you people bitching and complaining:

There is nothing wrong with this release, there is something wrong with your ability to read. Nowhere does this say this is a 720p DVD. If you read it, it clearly states that this is a regular DVD that he created with a ripped (x264 720p) version

If you don't want that, fine. Don't say you wasted your bandwidth when you couldn't even spend 30 seconds to read the description"
