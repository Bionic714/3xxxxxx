This is an experimental thing, Once converted they video seems to keep the High Def Aspect even thought it is on a DVD. The final output is an ISO Image just burn with your favorite program to a DVD and play. This has been tested with a HDTV Using a HDMI Output DVD player and the image is every bit as good as a BluRay disc, (I think so at Least). Seems that on some Tests the DVD player may not output the sound when hooked thru a standard 3 plug system yellow, red, and white. But if the DVD Has the option to switch over to PCM audio that fixes the problem. Let me know what you guys think in the forums that you Download this movie from and let me know if I can do something to improve this method, and what problems you are having This is the first one Good Luck Chuck.
