This is the one and only recording from the concerts at Albert Hall.
The recording had really a bad sound originally so I have added the 
sound from the live album "Is there anybody out there" from 2000 
and synced it with the video.

The video and the sound were not recorded in the same concert so
sometimes you will notice that they don't always synchronize properly.

DVD 1: Concert, part one
DVD 2: Concert, part two
       Extra material: 	Interviews, The Lost Documentary (about building the Wall)
			Photos of the band and from the concert.


PAL
Format: 4:3
Sound: Stereo, remastered
