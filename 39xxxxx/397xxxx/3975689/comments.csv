,rasalghul_Mex,2008-11-24T22:31Z,"Hey geekoid:
The Live album ""Is there anybody out there"" was published in 2000, but the concert is form the 1980-81 world tour Recorded live at the original Earls Court London performance, not the same date from the video, but the same place and tour.

plz seed."
