There's rarely a warm seat in the house whenever the Wiggles command the screen. This time Greg, Murray, Jeff, and Anthony host 50 minutes of flash and pizzazz in Hoop-Dee-Doo! It's a Wiggly Party. Over a dozen vibrant song and dance routines will inspire 2- to 8-year-olds to "Dance the Ooby Doo," "Move Like an Emu," and embrace the true spirit of "Hoop-Dee-Doo!" As if the delightful energy generated by these melodic gents and their usual cast of extras isn't enough, huge kaleidoscopic backdrops groove along with each song. Then there's Captain Feathersword: often giddy to the point of falsetto, here the good captain's comedic antics nearly cause his pirate buttons to pop. But, hey--it's a party! So fluff that feather sword, shine those dancin' shoes, and prepare to wiggle up an hour's worth of giggles, polkas, wobbles, and hula steps. (Yes, "mums and dads" find Wiggles tunes irresistible, too.)
