Your request has failed. Reason:
- Developer Certificates will be ENABLED for users who have a Publisher ID ONLY. (during GMT office hours)
- ONLY if you used a Publisher ID to create a .csr file with the DevCertCreate tool will you be able to use Open Signed Offline to create a Developer Certificate.
- Developer Certificates are currently DISABLED for users without a Publisher ID. Users who DO NOT have a Publisher ID CANNOT request Developer Certificates or use Open Signed Offline.
- Open Signed Online and Offline for users without a Publisher ID will NOT be available temporarily, an update will be provided during Week beginning 25th Feb
- If you have recently obtained a Publisher ID and are unable to create a Developer Certificate using Open Signed Offline please request support through the Symbian Signed forum on the Symbian Developer Network"
