,death734,2008-01-10T18:20Z,its not bad what you are doing but the scene rips for this show come out elsewhere (175mb and good quality) and get downloaded by thousands. search mininova
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-01-10T21:17Z,Hi Death. I rip this off my TiVo. I have it set on the lowest TiVo setting. I will crank it up to higher and work on compressing the file a bit. I looked at MiniNova and others and see the files but not for all days. Good to have a choice!
