,jcpoker508,2008-01-25T08:23Z,Some one please help! After I DL the file and convert and burn using Winavi I try to play the dvd in my dvd player but gives me a error messages about the disc not having a play back feature. Is this because it is in a region 5 fromat? I don't have this problem any other time.
