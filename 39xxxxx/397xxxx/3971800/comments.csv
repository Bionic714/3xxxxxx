,phlsphr,2008-01-21T04:21Z,"Should I overwrite my Halo PC files with the ones in the rar? And can I only play this via Hamachi, etc?

Thanks a bunch =D"
,Wufu-Torrents,2008-01-21T18:20Z," A question plz 

is this a cracked/hacked version or do you need a valid serial?"
,phlsphr,2008-01-21T18:56Z,cracked it seems. i didn't need a valid serial.
,Neotronic,2008-02-05T15:50Z,"This is a nice release Fapper, since I was looking for this kind of version...

Am seeding by the way...

I have this problem though. I want to make a Dedicated Server on my server computer.

I had a init.txt file since earlier that I  used. And it seemed to work fine, but when I try to connect to it. It gives me this error message. ""Connection Rejected: Client older then the server""

Got any solutions?"

,SkaRockin,2008-07-10T02:32Z,"if this works ill seed for about a month or so, this seems to be one of the easiest halo CE downloads iv seen, all the other ones say stuff about mounting the disc, and using an .ISO file for something then doing something with the cracked .exe, it sounded real confusing lol but this one look really easy to do.  will seed for long time"
,SkaRockin,2008-07-11T00:52Z,this works great!!! i hadta delete then unzip again to get it to work but either way its a great game. just wish ppl wud play an all snipers game more lol. but ill seed for a long time

,apalmer88,2009-03-06T16:18Z,i hope this is as good as people say... it says only online Multiplayer can i do it over LAN too?
,Reubenrun,2011-02-05T11:33Z,@spartanak47 you just have to wait. i have it on my vista pc and it usually takes from 3 to 6 mins before it loads. sometimes you can be lucky and it will load pretty quickly. its probably loading slow because you have loads of maps in the maps folder in the game files
