He was and will always be remembered as a superstar an a kiddie fiddler. Wonder if Garry Glitter will get the same loving send off?

oh well read this too lol Gary Glitter has filed a lawsuit on the heels of pop star Michael Jackson's death. The lawsuit contends that the contents of Jackson's Little Black Address Book has an equal amount of names contributed by Glitter over the years.

The book supposedly contains the names of over 7,000 young boys in the LA area and was only recently discovered by a maid working for Jackson. "

,soundbitesem,2009-08-04T10:33Z,"How do you burn this to DVD? Can it be done on a normal DVDR or do you need a dual layer disc.

There are 2 folders: AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS. AUDIO_TS is empty and VIDEO_TS has various files inside which I can play on VLC player.

How do I use Nero to burn, do I choose DVD-video when I open Nero and put the AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS files into Nero to burn?"
,intobearzz,2010-01-30T14:10Z,"HEY YA'LL! IT SUCK ALL. SOUND AND VISION. + THIS SHIT IS WAY TOO BIG. SO UPLOADER PUT SOME BAD SHIT IN HERE. SORRY BUSTER! AS U CAN SEE THERE'S OTHERS COMPLAINING BOUT THIS BS.
