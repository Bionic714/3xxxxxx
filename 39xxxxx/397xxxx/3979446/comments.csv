No hard feelings on my side. I know exactly what you are talking about.

I am usually just downloader, but I picked this one from a private tracker last night and since it wasn't on the TPB at the moment I felt I need to share it with fellows piratebayers. 

I am not the member of any group or so, just wanted to share what I've got on other place.

Once again, no hard feelings. Most important is that we finaly have a good release.

O would be happy if quality release of Golden Compass comes out soon :)"
