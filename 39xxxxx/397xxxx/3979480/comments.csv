thanks a lot for uploading this stuff. I personally would appreciate some Heidegger in German a lot.
But even more so: can you reseed your philosophy packages? There are about ten people (me included) stucj at 90something percent and no seeder there...
And finally - I understand the children's songs in your upload list - have chiuldren myself. But how the heck does Liselotte Pulver fit your profile?

,karlkarl2,2008-01-25T23:59Z,I now have also uploaded a collection of german articles on Heidegger from the magazin -Der Spiegel-. You might want to have a look on them too.
