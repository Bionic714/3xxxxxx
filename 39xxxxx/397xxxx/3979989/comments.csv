Do some research , you should never do it ... you are basically sealing the fate of that audio.. Normalizing is for amateurs.. Why dont you buy the cd with the files normalized ... cause the people who make it and are pro's know this is a stupid thing to do.. you ruin all dynamics.. In a mix you dont want all the files normalized as then they all just loud and have the same dynamics.. also further compression and dynamics processing  will just further degrade the sound quality.. these people record these samples through high quality converters ( ad/da) and high quality analogue signal signal path. Now with your probably el cheapo sound card you are destroying that quality...  To proove my statement , e mail 10 mastering studios and ask them should you normalize your audio before sending it to them they will laugh at you.. I'm not trying to be difficult but trying to inform you.. I am a sound engineer"

I must say, i'm a music student at a college in england and i do agree with what he is saying in part.

Just if you cant hear the sound just turn everything down so you can hear it. Works perfect!"
