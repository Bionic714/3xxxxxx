ArtyTorrent Pack 10-M-Audio Pro Sessions 24-Electro Patterns volume 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This repack is based on the DVD rip by AMPLiFY.

The RAR files contain just the WAVS and MIDI files.

I've deleted the REX files to keep filesize down and also done some further trimming of the oneshots. You can always chop up the loops yourself if you want to!

All loops are at 100bpm and veer towards the glitchy "experimental" side of electro. The sounds were made with vintage modular synths, but you won't find fat analogue pads or searing basslines. It's more of an ambient collection, with offbeat drumloops and percussion zaps. A few synths and basses are included, but aren't particularly amazing.
The 100 MIDI files (drums and synth patterns) are worth investigating by everyone, however.
