,nexia,2008-01-11T22:29Z,"you do not need to provide licenses for this script... you are actually giving one that is already well spread on the network...

do not try to spread the content on your own.  if you took a serial from a solid source, do not try to do the same on your own.  this serial is on the serial seeker for years."

,IpodTouchGuy,2010-06-13T12:41Z,"Guys, I have os x version 10.6.3 and i already have something called quicktime player. There are no settings. There is no option to register it. So when i download quicktime 7 from apple it tells me that 'QuickTime can't be installed on this disk. This version of QuickTime 7 can't be installed on this disk because QuickTime X is already present. Please use Software Update to install the appropriate version of QuickTime for your Mac.'
First, I don't have anything called quicktime x. 
Second, when I run Software Update it says I have no updates available.
If it helps, Quicktime Player says it's version 10.0. (X?)
Thanks "
,as.hole,2010-12-07T16:34Z,Where do I download the app itself. I can't find it for free on apples site? :(

Thanks for the up, will seed for a long time"
,zalozalo,2011-01-21T14:11Z,You can download the app from http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/
,zalozalo,2011-01-21T14:13Z,...and you need to do it from a Mac to get the Mac version ;)
,zalozalo,2011-01-21T14:22Z,"Sorry, that was the normal QuicTime app, not Pro :-("
,onedime,2011-01-27T15:12Z,"To use QuickTime Pro  on Mac OS 10.6 you have to install QuickTime 7 Player from http://support.apple.com/kb/DL923 or original disk in addition to QuickTime X preinstalled, than follow http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3678 to activate Pro features and enjoy!"
