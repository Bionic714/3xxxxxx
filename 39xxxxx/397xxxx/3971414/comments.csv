,superpaperdude,2009-10-21T09:36Z,"DUDE--thanks a billion for uploading this---it is SO hard to find VOB versions of movies, and i much prefer them to avi's for quality"
,soill,2010-01-17T23:27Z,"First off, thanks for this torrent. The video is fairly high quality, but for some reason the audio track(s) sound terrible. They are very hollow and it's pretty much impossible to understand what is being said. Has anyone else had this problem?"
,Nestea80,2010-04-12T05:55Z,"soill, yes I also found the audio to be horrible."
