Your antivirus might pick the extracted files up as a virus becuase the code within the files has been altered.

You will find this issue with most cracks."
,Devboy2007,2008-01-13T18:52Z,"Just to simplify things.... To apply the crack:

Copy everything from Crack1 Directory to the Autodata Directory on C: and then run ADCDA.exe and it will ask you for a code..

So run the Addkey.exe and enter the site code that is displayed on ADCDA.exe, once you have done that click generate and then copy the generated code and paste it in the UNLOCK section of ADCDA.exe. then click continue.

Once you have done that copy everything over from Crack2 Directory. and then Run ADCDA.exe and wola it works.

I have it running on Vista x86 aswell."

I've tried several Cracks for Autodata 3.18 and Autodata 2.18 but i havn't found one working yet. When i try to crack I end up with the same message: This version of the CD/DVD has expired. Please ensure that the correct version of the CD/DVD is installed.

Can anyone help me with the issue? maybe link a working crack or tell me why it doesn't work.

,Master_Yeti,2009-08-13T17:58Z,"1.Install Autodata 3.18

2.Copy the contents of Part 1 in the crack folder to C:\ADAD and overwrite the original files.

3.Copy the contents of Part 2 in the crack folder to C:\ADAD and overwrite the original files.

4.Turn off antivirus protection and run ADkey (don't worry when you see 3.16 all is ok)

5.Start Autodata, generate site code and unlock application.

6.Delete ADkey.exe

7.Start antivirus

8. Install Date Cracker and set to run 01/01/06"
