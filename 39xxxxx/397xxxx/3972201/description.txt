This is the best of the three ESL sets I've upped (that some nice fellow once upped via Demoniod).  Very useful for teaching, great lesson ideas for conversational English classes.  If you find them useful too, please share!  

P.S. - all files are Open Office documents (.odt).  I doubt MS office can open them, but if it wont, why not try open office?  They probably have a torrent on TPB somewhere...
