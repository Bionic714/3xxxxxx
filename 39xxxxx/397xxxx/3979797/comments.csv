an unable to Launch the Game now for some reason.

uninstalled the version & tried re installing it from the 7z file, same issue.

what do U suggest ?
How do I get it working ?"
[V],Subzero!,2008-02-02T10:36Z,"ok... go to sof folder and double click on:

1st: double click > CleanRegEntries.reg

2nd:double click > sof3-start.exe (esc exit)
3rd: double click > MakeDestopIcon.exe
and run game with!. make sure you didnt rename the folder, just extract with right mousebutton + choose from context menu
extract to... this way your pc needs less ressources during extracting.

also included in the mainfolder a text called

> how-to-un.install-rip-games.txt <  ;) ;)
"
[V],Subzero!,2008-02-02T10:38Z,"and lemme know if that worked, otherwise we gonna find another solution anyhow!... ;)"
,Mac Genius,2008-02-02T11:18Z,"Hi!
Thanks for the quick response

I did what you suggested.

I also re extracted the complete folder from the SoF3.7z file to a different location.
once I launch the game, it comes up with the disk icon on the top left of the screen
then its talking about 2007, Activision publishing etc.

when I hear to the Sound, it Loops as if it is stuck & the Pc freezes right here.
I do not see that Graphic where Activison spins around as in a Twister."

,mookieXL,2008-02-22T20:47Z,"One of mods you preinstalled has serious bug, it's impossible to kill second boss in pipeline level. 

You can fix it by deleting 'scripts' directory created by that mod, after that it'll work perfectly. 

I deleted some more things and it also fixed that ""white screen"" when running. 
I forgot which one it was though. Try it yourself (but don't forget to back up:) )"

2. When I hit the run button, I get a white screen..

,Juvetti,2009-03-25T02:14Z,"What kind of shit is this. Why is the gun in the middle of the screen? is it me that has done something wrong, or is the developers inbreed?

And is there any cheats for this game? this game sucks without cheats. And so did sof2 without cheats. But this sucks more :P

This was not worth downloading. Im so glad i didnt buy it in the store as i usually do if a game is good. 

Anyways, great torrent. Thanks, and it works fine for those out there that like crappy games."
