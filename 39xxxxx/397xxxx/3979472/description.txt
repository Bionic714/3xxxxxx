Staruha mha (the old lady of a moss in Russian) define their music as tribal psychedelic ritual. Roman Sidorov was the guy behind Staruha Mha one-man project. On 23rd September 2003, he commited suicide at his home vacation near Moscow. Being really strange person indeed, he was leading a secluded life during the last four years and had lost all connections with people around. Also he was addicted to drugs and used to take too much mushrooms recently - the very likely cause for this tragic turn. Nevertheless, all this time Roman was active and recorded really interesting and outstanding music which remained unknown to wide audience only due to his passive attitude and indifference to releasing somethingIt is inspired by archaic cults of nature and psychedelic experiences. The end result is a mix between harsh guitar drones, ethno (dark) ambient background, field recordings and elements of industrial noise
