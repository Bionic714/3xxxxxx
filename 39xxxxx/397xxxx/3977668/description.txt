'Near the end of World War II, the Allies must find out how much the Axis knows about building atomic bombs. The OSS recruits a physicist, Alvah Jesper, to reach his former colleague, Katerin Lodor, now in Switzerland, and bring her out for debriefing.' from IMDB user

This release, and my others (Objective Burma, Never So Few, and 13 Rue Madeleine) are in honor of the OSS and America's Special Operations Forces who have a rich and entertaining history which has profound philosophical implications on American foreign policy today.
