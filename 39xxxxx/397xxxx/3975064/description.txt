Permaculture (Permanent Agriculture) is the design of an ecologically sound way of living in our households, gardens, communities and businesses in co operation with Nature. 
This video, whose aim is to inspire people to start their own permaculture projects, shows how it is practised in four very different settings: a Hampshire back garden belonging to the editors of Permaculture Magazine, including fruit trees, vegetables, bees, chickens and ducks; a community co op in Devon, which involves a caf√©, allotments and local composting scheme; a City Challenge project in Bradford close to a housing estate with 10,000 residents, tackling the problems of unemployment, environmental awareness and backyard food growing; and a small farm in the Forest of Dean where innovative marketing schemes ensure a close link between producer and consumer including a vegetable box scheme, organic meat, and locally produced charcoal.
