DVD release 6 disc set is easy to find @ Amazon $28 free ship, and @ Best Buy $35.

So where's the DVD rip!?  ;)"
[T],AW-,2011-01-09T22:09Z,New rips coming soon
,Skram0,2011-07-04T02:46Z,"So it's been like 6 months. Wher dem new rips?
I see some recent DVD rips elsewhere, but they're crap Xvid rips. Xvid is crap quality.

Looking for x264 rips to preserve the original as much as possible. Why take old crappy video and crap them out even more with a crap codec like Xvid."
,k3nd00d,2012-04-24T17:22Z,"XviD is not crap, it is all about bitrate and other settings. In fact XviD (.h263) and mp4 (.h264) are VERY close to the same codec."
