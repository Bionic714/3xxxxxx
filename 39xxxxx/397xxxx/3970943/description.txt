Quality isn\\\'t the best, but this show is very hard to find. It is about a pilot in the 1930\\\'s who flies a \\\"Goose\\\" plane, water capable. Set in the South Pacific, it has interesting characters with decent acting, a cute dog who is smarter than his owner, and a lot of action. It mixes adventure with comedy, throw in a little romance, add some period tension, a gold monkey and this is what you get. Tales of the Gold Monkey starring Stephen Collins, Caitlin O\\\'Heaney, Jeff McKay and Roddy McDowell.
