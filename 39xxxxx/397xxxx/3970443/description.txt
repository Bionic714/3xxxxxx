Tough young Jenny (Hannah Herzsprung, in a meteoric debut peformance) is serving time in a women's prison in Luckau, Germany. She meets her match in the elderly Traude (Monica Bleibtreu), a Prussian woman who has been teaching piano to the inmates since World War II. But Traude's near-obsessive attachment to Jenny goes far beyond musical professionalism, becoming something much more fervid and intense. Everything hangs in the balance when the dramatic details of both Jenny and Traude's pasts threaten to be revealed.
