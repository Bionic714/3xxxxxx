Episode 3 The Fear Makers

After Seaview's sister ship, Polidor, is lost on an experimental shakedown deep dive, Seaview is dispatched by Nelson to discover the cause of the sinking. Two psychologists are assigned to the monitor the crew and their behavior. They are also the same scientists that developed an experimental nerve gas, called the Fear Gas, which heightens the senses and causes fear in those that are exposed. One scientist is working in coordination with foreign powers to cause Seaview to sink as well. However, a strong willed Nelson manages to suppress his fears, and guide the Seaviewto safety.
