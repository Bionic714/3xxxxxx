,Proneer,2008-01-30T03:09Z,Thanx for a great release - is it still being seeded ? I can see that only a part of this release is being seeded out there.. 
,Felix_2000,2008-02-06T13:44Z,We can only hope :-) It says 1 seeder? but?
,yvvbw,2008-02-06T15:11Z,"Please seed someone. I have a really good connection, but still my download sucks, and my share rate just passed 6. Somebody must be very happy about me, but I consider limiting my upload."
,max.nordlund,2008-02-07T00:10Z,"I will seed, but my internet connection was down this week and it was only minutes ago the I was able to restore it. (I had to get a new router and it took some time). Plz stay and reseed, it's an awful big release and I can't seed it all alone. Thanx."

,flyingfree,2008-03-09T05:00Z,OKay so if there are so many seeders out htere why have I been limited to one and now finally two.  I have had one seeder and a whole wack of leachers off me all of us sitting at 55% or so gettiing about 1 percent per day of the file if I am really lucky
,johnII,2008-03-09T15:03Z,Hey i'm seeding at all time...but i do need help! I have set Upload Limit to Unlimited and BandWidth Allocation to high...the upload speed varies from 95 kb/s to 150kb/s. I do not have anything else downloading or uploading so is there any other setting i could try to speed up the upload? And for all of you who already downloaded 100% Plz Seed!!
,johnII,2008-03-09T15:05Z,"...and also, i have a 24MB line, so i guess i can't seed enough for everybody to be at happy speed....so again, SEED!!"
,danuchi,2008-03-09T15:34Z,"Iam maxing my seed limit now, tho i only have season 1 and half of season 2 done.

,danuchi,2008-03-09T15:35Z,Iam gonna be seeding ful this weekend (have only season 1 and 1/2 of season 2 done)
,flyingfree,2008-03-09T21:49Z,"Is it a tracker issue, can we get the listing on another tracker, I am showiong only piratebay, though I have done better with other files that only have a single tracker."
,flyingfree,2008-03-09T21:51Z,"i am often maxes out on what i can share as I have the most of any I am connected to, I am using bitcomet, is there a setting change I can switch, I am at level 8 of the ranking system if that has anything to do with this issue"
,max.nordlund,2008-03-16T01:21Z,"Here is some open trackers, I will use them and if you do the same hopefully your filesharing will go faster:
