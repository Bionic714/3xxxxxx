,Pharaoh2008,2008-03-18T16:39Z,"I just finished DL, and MOST of it seems in order. However, when I read the PDF files, it describes DVD's that I don't seem to have. Also, I've got 214 objects saying ""_____padding_file_0_if you see this file, please update to BitComet 0.85 or above____""

I DL BitComet, and tried opening those files with it, but got an error msg. Can someone please help? I think I'm missing DVD's #1 & #2.

Keep seeding! =D"
