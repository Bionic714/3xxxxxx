,GreedosCreations,2008-01-10T16:36Z,I hope nobody buys this in real life... 'cuz I hate what they did to Spider-Man and hope that they feel a financial impact.
,Woobedoo,2008-01-10T22:37Z,"I'm torn - on the one hand, this new storyline is a refutation of the silliness that was CIVIL WAR.  On the other hand, the way they got into this new storyline is equally silly.
