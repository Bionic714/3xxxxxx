,bobrequa,2008-01-13T07:10Z,I've been searching for torrents of this show and sanford and son but never could figure out why they dont seem to exist. Get seeding on this and I have several discs to follow to keep Bunker alive. I can dig up Sanford and Son too. These are essentials
,bobrequa,2008-01-13T07:20Z,"Here are some series I've been looking for but no can find:

Bob Newhart show
carol burnett show
bonanza
cannon
barnaby jones
waltons

hawaii five-0
leave it to beaver
dennis the menace
partridge family season 3 & 4
McCloud
