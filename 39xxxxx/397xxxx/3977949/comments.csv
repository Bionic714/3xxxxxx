I am dloading (& seeding) all the Chinese lang stuff you upload.

Thanks!"

Glad you like.

Still a bit more to go on this upload before I up the next.

I'm thinking some music as a change of pace.

A little Mainland Chinese death metal, maybe some punk ;)

,melbournezones,2010-06-14T11:05Z,"daoban, you say:

""This material is designed for Chinese in China.

The language is NOT spoken slowly for the benefit of a foreigner trying to learn Chinese.""

Can't you Chinese people stop using the term ""foreigner"" just for one moment?

Another thing, don't Chinese learners of English watch movies in English that aren't ""...spoken slowly for the benefit of a foreigner trying to learn English""???  If you want to make Western friends, you should know this: Westerners have as much ability to learn Chinese as Chinese have to learn English.  We don't need learning material slowed down to a snail's pace.

I remember I watched a show on CCTV4 or some other channel.  They had a western guest on there.  They started speaking to him extremely slowly as if he was from another planet.  They forgot they were actually speaking in English and it wasn't necessary.
