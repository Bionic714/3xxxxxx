,guinefort,2008-01-13T06:18Z,"Ok, just a quick detail about the fix: in the control panel, it will show the License valid until: followed by Month/Day/Year. It will be about a month, for me almost a month and a week. But below it will say trial days remaing: mine says 15,363 days left, or over 42 years. Just so no one freaks out."

,bentrader,2008-01-13T10:06Z,"The fix set it to update DIRECTLY from ESET eval update server, which is preferred...

,deBastaard,2008-01-13T20:57Z,"It works great! Thanks! 42 trial years left!!! :P  is this version (trial) just as good as the full version??? (on the protection status it says: upgrade to full version)  and this is protection for virus and spyware, right? Please answer! 

Thanks!"
,ernescz,2008-01-14T12:39Z,"It really works. Trial period until eternity or the end of time, depending on which comes first. Even though it's a trial, I think there's no difference with the full version - if they make a bad trial then no one would buy the full version. Thanks for the up! :) Keep it coming! "
,doadruss,2008-01-14T15:07Z,Is there any benefit to using the Business version over the home version?
,Salman76,2008-01-14T23:38Z,"working like a charm,Updateding to the last Virus signature,expires after 42 years which is awesome.

The fix by TemDono and Nod32 3.0.621 is an instal and forget software. Thanks TemDono for ur final fix ,Thanks torrent uploaders and seeders.

Tips about Nod32 V3.x 

1-the NOD32 Company says that all the Antivirus software from Eset Nod32 is full versions,,also the trial versions are full version ,all options are working, and i tested that by myself.so cheers everybody we have a full version will expire at 2050 

2-People who asking about the difference  between business edition and home edition..,.If u have Workstations,Networks and Servers at a company or Hotel or whatever u will need to install ESET NOD32 Antivirus v3.0 Business Edition as it  includes Remote Administrator, LAN update ""mirror"" and can be installed on servers. (Home Editions do not support server installations.)

3- If u need an antivirus just for ur home pc or ur laptop ,,just install the Nod32 3.0.621 home edition.

4-If u want an antivirus and + personal firewall + antispam all in one ,,,u need to install Nod32 Smart Security 3.0.621

keep in mind The fix by TemDono works only with all ESET nod32 products verion 3.0.621.

,Hednoize,2008-01-25T00:51Z,"Tried it the 24th of January. The eset servers said my username/password was incorrect/blacklisted. (I forgot the wording over the night).
I tried StoneTonie's links and it works fine and updated definitions to 2820 (20080124). I noticed people started bashing that guy with namecalling and other useless comments. If you don't like a torrent, you don't have to get it. If you don't like somones tips then you don't have to follow it. Why are you assuming that his information is ""wrongful"" when you have no proof? He says it stopped working after a few days for him and I know the Eset servers didn't accept this version+fix when I used it. Btw, his theory about Eset blocking old trial versions from using the updateservers sounds very likely. That would be a logical thing to do for Eset. If I was them i would block all trialversions if it's older than 30 days AND I've released a newer trial version. Great way to prevent a trial+fix like this."

,Salman76,2008-01-26T15:35Z,"Hednoize,Obviously u did not know how to use this final fix 1.1 by TemDono,either because u did not read the instructions carefully or maybe u a noob at PCs, i have been using this fix with all ESET nod32 ver 3.0.621 for a month now and all working great and updating from eset servers,many people are complaining about the password and username because they dont know how to apply the fix,and for StoneTonie we are not bashing him,but its not accepted to see him posting 3 comments daily about his suspecious servers and calling the fix uploaders names while we have the right fix that allows u to update officially from eset servers"
,Hednoize,2008-01-27T22:16Z,"What you are saying is just ridiculous. First of all you replied to my post but ignored most of what I wrote. Second you come up with the old ""you did not know how to use this"". There's three steps in the instructions. Install the included Nod. Install Fix and restart comp. Update virus definitions. There is no way to not understand how to follow those instructions. No point saying I didn't know how to. ""Update the virus definitions"" resultet in a denial from the Eset servers when _I_ did it. That's all I said. I didn't say it didn't work for someone else. My point still remains valid. That other guys ideas with the 3rd party servers are working and this fix didn't work for me. That's what I said and there's nothing to debate about it. What I also said is that I think it's silly that people just assume that the servers he mentioned are ""suspicious"" without any grounds for such a theory. If I go spamming www.google.com 3 times at every torrent, that doesn't mean the site is strange just cause my behaviour or motive seems odd. If you're gonna direct messages to me. How about actualy discussing what I wrote and not wether the fix works for some or everyone else but me. That doesn't concern me. Neither your theories of me not being able to follow the simple instructions in the readme."

Tested this with patch on isolated virtual machine windows xp sp2.

Installs fine, patch works with OFFICIAL update servers (set update to choose auto), I used a user/pass from http://www.nod321.com/ which actually work for a while with the unpatched version anyway.

Now is green again but license expires on 03.03.08.
I will lookout untill then.
Thanks anyway to all who helped me."
,jimmsta,2008-02-10T19:29Z,"I'm guessing that the license in this is a custom expiration license, probably used in some big corporate company, with no maximum amount of licenses - ESET offers the ability when ordering licenses to do things like that, for a minimal amount of $$$ extra. I personally have a custom license that is ""For promotional use only"", which didn't cost me anything, right from ESET! I'm guessing that the guys that wrote the crack had access to a custom license, and repacked it using the ESET configuration editor, with it included in the installer - something that's also do-able though ESET's tools. 

This is the BEST antivirus suite on the market. I wouldn't use anything else - not ever."

[T],CaptainUnderpants,2008-02-22T21:17Z,"c0ltish ... you're an idiot. I've been using this patch for over a month now and it works fine. You don't need to enter anything in for the username and password. Whatever you did, you did it wrong, so STFU.

You just remove any antivirus you have running (which might require a restart), then you install NOD32 Antivirus. Then when the program starts, go to the Task Manager and force quit 'egui.exe' and 'ekrn.exe' ... after this, install the patch and restart the computer.

Upon restart, open up NOD32 and go to the Advanced settings and set the update server to Automatic, and then update the antivirus. Congrats ... this will give you a 15,000+ day fully working version of NOD32 Antivirus. If you can't figure out the patch after these instructions, you're a moron."

I have that kind of thing a couple times per a day. I suspect it's just by design (my cpu is Athlon 4000+). Well, perhaps there's nothing I can do about it.

,ltorrentstorm,2008-09-02T13:49Z,"I'd be the latest poster :)  Thank you!  It worked flawlessly just as posted.  One thing I noticed that it doesn't place the expiration date anywhere.  I only see a grayed out partial in the last ""About"" page saying ""Temdono fix expir...."" and because it's small I can't read anymore than that. So maybe I'll get like what, 100 years? :D But looking good!  2 thumbs up!"
,ltorrentstorm,2008-09-03T06:16Z,"Correction: it updated automatically and now shows ""Remaining trial period: 15130 days.""  Cool! Thanks again!"
,Kaedral,2008-10-04T00:13Z,"Hmm, very odd... For some reason this won't work on my laptop... When I try to update the update gets stuck without moving from 0%. I have set the update to ""chose server automatically"" I have installed the fix and I have even used a acc/pass from www.nod321.com but it still won't update. Reinstalled it over and over again and now it's driving me nuts. Please could someone give me a helping hand? I am using the same on my stationary computer and here it works fine.. I have no idea why it won't wotk on my laptop... Please help -Xorz"
