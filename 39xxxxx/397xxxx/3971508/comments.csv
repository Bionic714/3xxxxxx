,the_nakaii,2008-01-11T05:31Z,everybody was new at some point. to download a torrent file you need a download a torrent client. I suggest Bittorrent. Just google Bittorrent and use the link provided to Bittorrent's Official website. Download Bittorrent and install it. Then come back here and click on the Download this torrent link. Bittorrent should open a dialogue window. you can specify a folder to put the completed file. just use the browse button and choose Desktop or My Documents. I always use desktop. click ok and your file should start downloading automatically.
,the_nakaii,2008-01-11T05:49Z,in addition I suggest the use of the latest FireFox internet browser because of its really good download manager. you can open the torrent file from the download manager if your bittorrent client doesn't for some reason open up automatically.
