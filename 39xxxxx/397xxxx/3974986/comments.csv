anyways upload speed will get better over the course of the day and start sharing ppl...you'll love this game...insane graphics."

back tomorrow:)"

You can actually run a PC for months on end so how about seeding the torrent. Everyone seems to be stuck at 23.1%.
A file of this size would ideally be seeded for a week/month. On Demonoid i had things running for months on end. Kinda defeats the file sharing thing if you switch your computer off :(  "
[T],grimreaper420,2008-01-14T11:18Z,"globalfish,

thanx for ur comment...it is now up and running, enjoy:)"
,globalfish,2008-01-14T13:14Z,"Still got days to go but at least we're movin' again. Should have a good ratio when this finishes:) 
'xcuse me grimreaper but as it appears no-one has completed are you 'initial seeding/superseeding' depending on what bittorrent client you're using. Just curious(as it speeds things up initially).
Thanks in advance for the up - look forward to tryin' it out. "

90k up & 0.1k down.  Day and a half for 37% with a 20 meg line. I wish you'd initial seeded it grimreaper - then we wouldn't all be hanging around requesting the same pieces. Doesn't even show ETA now - yesterday was 9 weeks +!
Why didn't you 'initial seed' a torrent of this size? Do you understand how initial seeding works? Because we all want the same bit, it's really slow and all we seem to be doing is feed the new downloaders. "

""I wish you'd initial seeded it grimreaper - then we wouldn't all be hanging around requesting the same pieces.""

Response: I have now enabled initial seeding, and no, I'm not familiar with how to properly seed a torrent of this size, as I have mentioned this is my first uploaded torrent.

,Weedman1990,2008-01-16T21:11Z,grimreaper420 its all depending on you to seed very fast. you do that the more people will be able to download an wen they have recieved the file they can start helping you to seed.
,globalfish,2008-01-16T21:16Z,"@grimreaper420
 you really need to leave your PC on until some of us complete this torrent. you've had us all hanging round for three days getting nowhere. Leave your PC on, walk away and come back to it in a week. 
To upload such a big torrent and not seed it is pointless. Read the comments and see how many people are frustrated and next time seek some advice before jumping in at the deep end.

@marshull
glad someone told Jokkmokk___ how torrenting works :)   "
[T],grimreaper420,2008-01-16T23:52Z,"Attention to people who is downloading my file:

I AM SEEDING THIS FILE.
My computer has been on for many hours, and I won't turn it off.
I am trying my best, and if you people keep on complaining I will delete this torrent, OK?
I refreshed this page, and I now see 2 SEEDERS,
82 leechers, and I am initially seeding this torrent.
What I have noticed is between 12 am to 6 am EST my time, my speeds are 90-140 kb's/sec.
Right now I'm only seeding between 5-10 kb's/sec unfortunately as of 5:52 PM EST.
I have checked my firewall, uTorrent is allowed.
Network is OK, green circle with check mark.
So again, please by patient, I do not have a T1 connection, but better than most.
Plus, I don't know how many people even respond as fast as me compared to other torrents.
I think I have been more than nice, and this will likely be my last post.

,NeutralGold,2008-01-17T04:36Z,Just wondering if you're using peerguardian grim? You could be subject to massive torrent poisoning which I believe is the problem. Check your current connections and see if there are several ip's that have more completed than the majority. There are loads of poison bots that will suck up your upload speed and give nothing in return. I turned off peer guardian and noticed there are about a 5-12 people from a specific ip range with 70-98% finished with the file. Which means they're are hogging up the file.. Please use peerguardian :P
[T],grimreaper420,2008-01-17T14:50Z,"@NeutralGold

Using Hide IP Platinum, and yes, I disabled it.
Changed port #'s, updated that through my D-link  router, I even connected directly to the modem...same speed.
I have Norton 360, but using Vista's firewall.
I don't like Norton's firewall.
Can you guys tell me have you uploaded/seeded a file this size, and what was ur uploading speed?
Initial seeding still btw..."
,NeutralGold,2008-01-17T15:30Z,"Well, I still encourage you to get peer guardian simply because it blocks specific IP's from connecting to you. Especially the bots and/or Government ip addresses. My area and the surrounding states have crappy upload speed. We all usually have around same download speed. And you have to pay a premium for crappy ass upload. I can only get as much as 60KBps upload. Thats for DSL, cable isn't allowed any higher upload speed other than 15KBps, thats for business and residential. So pretty crappy around here. 

You mentioned you reached pretty high at certain hours of the night. So I imagine you have cable? Cable shares nodes with people around your general housing area, which can cause severely camped up data speeds if your nodes got to many people on it. 

Any hoo, just trying to help you out. I actually quit downloading it because I seen everyone's % was going up way to slow and I just happen to catch all of the bots hogging the file up. Peer guardian won't do anything for your speed, but I bet if you get it, people will start getting the file better~

Good luck!"
[T],grimreaper420,2008-01-17T21:03Z,"Note: PeerGuardian 2 does not support Windows Vista at the moment. This is a top priority, and we hope to have a Vista download soon.

[T],grimreaper420,2008-01-18T02:26Z,"I just figured out why people complain they're not getting good speeds- too many leechers compared to my original seed.

,globalfish,2008-01-19T17:10Z,"Just as an update grimreaper - in utorrent it's only been showing a availability of 63% - 66% for the last three days. I remember when you started, it was showing you  at 100% but now even after 5 days i still only have 63% yet have shared all the way- had a constant 1.5+ ratio for the last few days. If people have completed (3 according to tpb), then you should turn off initial seeding now (but it looks like they've disappeared anyway). Sadly as it's only showing 66% availability all of us 63%ers are stuck as even though we're running, no-one has the other 37% the majority of us need to complete the download.

I was up all night doing stuff, and my computer was on 24/7.
What I have noticed is this.
I switched over from uTorrent last night, to Azureus and for some reason all 4 of my seeded files went up through the roof, between 1:30 am and 6 am 100-160 kb'sec...had it set @ initial/super seeding, then changed it back to seeding.
Soooo here's the problem...I have been watching this torrent like a hawk- people who are between 80% and up do complete this torrent, but once it's done, they're gone-rarely do they stick around.
There's everybody's problem right there...then you wonder why there's not enough seeds, duhh.
Highest I see right now is 98.3...87.6...with the majority @ 63.4%.

,globalfish,2008-01-20T02:17Z,Well another 1% in 13 hours. everyone stuck at 64.7% as no-one has a full copy. Not one person has more than that. 6 days now. This is gonna be one of those never completed torrents. Lost all faith in this one but will try and hang it out. Not seen a single seeder for days. Are most of you other dudes in the same boat? How come i can never see grimreaper seeding anymore? do you get the same view from where you are?  In the beginning he showed on utorrent but disappeared now. Comments from other downloaders would be appreciated. Any suggestions anyone? I'd say cut the initial seeding off and make sure it's an exception in the firewall settings but i really don't know. Any internet boffins out there...
,globalfish,2008-01-20T02:45Z,"@ grimreaper

Don't take the above post of mine as a critisism. I just don't know why we are all stuck if you are still seeding. And it doesn't show you as being connected.It seems i'm not the only one in this situation judging by MD2303's comment also.
Out of curiosity what ratio do you have now you've been seeding it continuosly for 6 days. be interesting to know if you don't mind me asking. This has been the most frustrating torrent in my years of downloading. I download more than your complete file in a night sometimes - you can see why people are getting flustered :)  Oh well that's what happens sometimes i s'pose..."
,MD2303,2008-01-20T05:30Z,It seems that the later it gets the faster my download speeds are. In the afternoon it was at 0.2 kb/s and now its about 11:30 and its up to about an average of 100 kb/s. :D yay

you gotta laugh sometimes. With most ISP's, you'll probably find speed goes up as the normal people go to bed. A lot of companies throttle the speed and i know Virgin do if you are connected continuously. Mind you, i upped over 400GB on Demonoid and it ran for weeks without downtime.I get blistering downloads that peak around 6am. Though to be fair, my speeds are pretty god most of the time. It's just that Virgin's upload speed is capped to a crappy 725k despite having a 20MB line. My best test has been with 19960k down so i ain't too worried. I think by the time i get to play it, it'll be the equivalent of pacman and be considered 'old school'   lmao

are there many peers showing over 70% of the file in your client? I just don't see  'em. You probably have the most commented torrent on tpb :)

,becquerel,2008-02-10T12:33Z,Hi i found a solution to the problem. The problem seems to be that the patch replases Crysis.exe  and making the program say that it cuoldn't find the correct cd. I then then replaced the exe with the crack again (I believe you also have done this) and it worked just fine until i was going to load a game (then the player is just lying on the ground shaking kind of). I think the problem is that the cracked Crysis.exe isn't compatible with the patch. I downloaded this http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3967643/Crysis.Update.1.1.-ViTALiTY and dind't use the patch because it is already patched but i used the crack that comes along it because it seems to be made for the cracked version. Now it works! I can even load the games i made with the old exe so the incompatibilityproblems isn't in the saving but the loading.

,jerin8,2009-02-06T00:45Z,okay I admit I am a noob. I hope someone is out there to answer this. I have extracted the files and I cannot find an executable file or a set up file to begin the game set up. This is my first time using torrents. Please assist. Thank you!
,jerin8,2009-02-06T00:47Z,never mind I was blind and now I see! It is a miracle!
,jerin8,2009-02-06T02:07Z,"Unable to run installer says it cannot launch the CD key tool. Again I am a noobie. I see another has the same problem but do not see a detailed answer at least that I understand to fix the problem. Is someone willing to walk me through a fix? Like ABC, 123 type of thing. I would be very appreciated. Thank you."

,Iarecake,2009-03-23T20:36Z,"I downloaded the game, i enjoy it. BUT
theres one little fucking annoying thing in the game.
You must not die. If you do you have to start all over from the beginning.
If you die and load the game, it will just bug and you will still be dead!

And oh, I went like half of the game without dying, then i jumped on a roof, it collapsed and i died from the fall? wtf.

Good game, thanks for the uploader, nice."
,therussian4340,2009-07-11T03:23Z,This works great this is my second download. I'm seeding 24/7 so don't give up if connection is slow. im going at 20 to 15 kb.
,thecu3e,2009-08-02T11:40Z,need more seeds....!!!!
,sceptre37,2009-08-11T22:05Z,"http://www.crymod.com/thread.php?threadid=15318
Iarecake is right. This game is wonderful but in order to beat it or do anything i cant die once. The save games do not load properly and restart lv does not work in order to play again you gotta start with the new game button at main menu. I found a link that told me that cracks are not supported and that is why it doesnt work. The link has the issue."
