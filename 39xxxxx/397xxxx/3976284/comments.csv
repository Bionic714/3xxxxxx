I recommend anybody read everything she's done so far. Kind of a female Cormac McCarthy, but she might actually be even better. :)

Unfortunately despite the seeder/leecher quote above, there doesn't seem to be any seed. Although me and up to 7-8 peers have been stuck at 99.2 for at least a week.

Thats still quite listen-to-able, but a shame that it wont complete. "
