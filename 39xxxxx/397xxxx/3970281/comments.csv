,stateofdreaming,2008-01-13T16:52Z,Gotta love these stupid fucks that waste peoples valuable bandwidth by not testing their fucking torrents first. 15GB of my monthly 60 wated ASSHOLE.
,uffesnuffe,2008-01-14T17:00Z,"There is a DVD9 torrent that works here:
http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3386390/Once_Upon_A_Time_In_The_West_(1968)_PAL_Multi_Lang___Subs_DVD9.3386390.TPB.torrent

I got at decent download average of 60 kB/s. After removing all the unnecessary languages and menues a compression ratio of 70% is needed to fit the main movie on a DVD5."
