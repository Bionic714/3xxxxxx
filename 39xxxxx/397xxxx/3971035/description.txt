23C3 Video Recordings

Video recordings of the lectures of the 23rd Chaos Communication Congress

The 23nd Chaos Communication Congress (23C3: Who Can You Trust?) took place from December 27th to December 30th 2006 at Berliner Congress Center in Berlin, Germany. This channel offers the complete set of available recordings of the 23C3 lectures. Most lectures are in english, some in german. The videos are being offered in an iPod-compatible encoding (MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 with AAC, 640x480). 

I don\'t have the fastest internet connection but I will leave it on for weeks.

Details on the videos are here
