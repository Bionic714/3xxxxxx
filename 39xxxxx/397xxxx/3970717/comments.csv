NOW THEN

WHERE THE ""F""EPH are 3 and 4, your welcome hbo, no one else but nutcases like us care as much about this show.  Now Yes see if you can convince Simon to oversee and don't fuck with him for some big screen shit, no idea what, just see if he's got ideas, cause it will suck if he isn't the overseer of it, we all know it."

,youngbull41,2008-01-12T03:21Z,"incase you missed my initial msg I'm looking for 3 and 4 as well....

if i had em why wouldn't i upload em?"
,bipple,2008-01-14T17:58Z,"this is still the same episode where freamon is making it so mcnulty can take the call, this is either ep six or five, i've fucking d/l'd this shit twice from two dif links, someone else said the had ep seven and it wsn't, neither is this. FA HUCK
this shit took forever to get as well.  fuck it, i'll just watch it, unless somone can fucking post  1-7 batch style in a folder, i don't think anyone has the brains to put up 3,4 and yes 7, cause this isn't it. it worked i d/l'd and its not it again
GREAT.  twice ridiculous"
,bipple,2008-01-14T18:03Z,"just checked my folders this ep is 564mb when all is said and done, its episode five, i know cause i got five in a folder that says five, then two different ones that say seven, and they have the same size and opening, now ep six is same size but guess what, its fucking not that freamon mcnulty opening again.  why hasn't anyone complained about this yet.

















>?"
,mogster82,2008-01-21T21:52Z,This is NOT episode 5!!! Looks like episode 7 to me. And the first part is here.
,ProudAnselmo,2008-01-22T07:38Z,"Kofi_Mensah, you fucking dick.  If you were pissed about knowing that, did it occur to you not to spoil it for anyone else?  Fuck you."
,bigboystance,2008-01-22T23:02Z,"This is not episode 5 for sure, I believe this is 7!"
,francesco1232,2008-01-23T04:35Z,"this is episode 7 100%
anything about 8 or 9 yet???"
,mmcgrath,2008-01-24T18:17Z,"this is absolutely episode 5, not 7.  not hard to figure it out based on file sizes and actually watching it."
,Mossbergslimpkt,2008-01-26T05:44Z,"Francesco you're 100% fucking retarded.  This isn't 7 dipshit and the rest of you fucktards co-signing it are just as stupid.

This is not episode 7 at all and it should be taken down"
,francesco1232,2008-01-27T04:25Z,Mossbergslimpkt  why don't u suck my fucking dick. its gotta be 7 they get the cell phone pictures in this one.
,Rjamie,2008-01-27T11:01Z,"This is most definitely Episode 7, and it is also the whole episode. Episode 5 is the one with Clay Davis threatening to go kicking and screaming, and Duke trying to learn to fight.

This one is about Clay Davis' trial and McNulty giving out OT hours to other cases.

Good quality, even though it's broken up into three parts. 8/10."
,Ivan4,2008-01-28T20:46Z,"This is episode 7. Don`t listen to all this bullshit.
Any word on when episode 8 will be avaliable?"
,Alexxxx,2008-01-28T21:21Z,"I would kill for ep 8. 
McNulty is so f*cked up this season and I love it :)"
,cosimo24,2008-01-29T21:53Z,ok anyone have a link to 5?
,datkins7700,2008-01-31T02:15Z,It's 7. Have no fear.
,linkaster,2008-01-31T16:41Z,"Anyone have news on ep 8? Thanks youngbull41, great work for uploading this. "
,Pungo_SR,2008-02-01T04:00Z,"Damn, what a great friggin season!  Thanks Youngbull41 for this episode!  Someone toss a link to Ep8 if/when you find it please!"
,youngbull41,2008-02-02T22:50Z,"You're welcome...not sure why there are those of you who don't think this is EP7, but u are seriously confused....

perhaps the other eps you downloaded are labeled wrong and you have been watching in the wrong order....

i'll post 8when i get my hands on it...hopefully soon"
,Pungo_SR,2008-02-03T07:43Z,"Bah, don't mind them man.  They fit 1 of 2 bills: utter morons or premature ejaculators.  Keep up the great work, it's much appreciated!  Side note:  I tried not to watch ahead of my Tivo?d season but I just couldn't help myself.  Thanks to you I'm 3 weeks ahead and eagerly awaiting the next episode!  This shows like CRACK!"
,youngbull41,2008-02-04T06:26Z,"i know the feeling...a friend introduced me to the show just a few months ago and i've been catching up on all 4 seasons since...finished season 4 about a month ago and have been hurtin for more ever since....

waiting on Ep 8 and 9 from a friend...will post ASAP

glad this worked for you guys...i've just been hanging around for a while now and this was my first set of uploads...glad they're workin out

Cheers"
,snackwankboon,2008-02-05T00:42Z,this is definitely ep7.  thanks for the up! lookin forward to 8 and 9!
,domino87,2008-02-06T04:18Z,youngbull that would be sick if you could up 8 and 9 when you get them. thanks brotha.
,Pungo_SR,2008-02-06T10:45Z,"LOL, young, that's some serious friggin TV watching man!  That's the main reason I haven't gotten into seasoned programs like 24.  I've missed too many episodes/seasons and there's far too many combined hours for me to even fathom trying to catch up.  On a series like The Wire though... it should literally be a crime to miss.  Don't miss HBO's mini-series The Corner.  It's a 6 episode re-enactment of real life inhabitants of these Baltimore ghetto's.  The Corner also spawned The Wire.  Here's TPB's torrent link: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3516107/The_Corner-_by_HBO_-_All_6_Eps"
,hassan9,2008-02-09T22:12Z,been sharing for many years... got a letter from HBO about this specific season... just a heads up.
,snackwankboon,2008-02-12T06:16Z,hassan9 what do you mean?
,Pungo_SR,2008-02-12T07:39Z,"He has no torrent uploads of his own.  He's a seeder at best, more likely a leecher.  I wouldn't put any faith into his hassan9's /quote statements /unquote. (TPB still doesn?t accept quotes?) I'm only a seeder as well, but I wouldn't make any off the wall BS comments like that without any proof or at the very least a detailed explanation. Disregard it... and him."
,Cheyco,2008-02-15T02:47Z,Definitely episode really looking for 8 and 9.  Anybody got anything?
,ProudAnselmo,2008-02-16T04:44Z,"This file fucked up my computer.  It crashed windows explorer and wouldn't let me delete it until I restarted in safe mode.  Whoever uploaded this, fuck you."
,youngbull41,2008-02-16T12:02Z,"you're fucked...the file is not what fucked up your computer...alot of users have downloaded this without problem and there is nothing in the file that would cause your computer to crash...

hoop you head and save your idiotic comments for some loser who doesn't know any better"
,ProudAnselmo,2008-02-18T14:41Z,"I don't know what ""hoop you head"" means, but I know I've downloaded hundreds of torrents, and this is the only one that has ever given me a problem.  I can't speak for anyone else, just my own experience, and my comment reflects that.

I'm not running any firewalls or anything, so maybe that's why some other people haven't had a problem, but this fucking file hijacked my system and wouldn't let me delete it.  

I had to run system restore and delete it in safe mode.  I literally could not delete it any other way, because it froze my computer every time I even clicked on it.  

I'm sorry you don't like my comment, but I feel obliged to warn people away from something that might give them similar problems.  Deal with it."
,telesphorus,2008-02-18T20:32Z,i found no problems with this file.
,Pungo_SR,2008-02-21T09:54Z,"I'm sorry you had problems ProudAnselmo, yet this file was not to blame.  I am a network engineer in trade and have performed overhauls of quite a few fortune 500 companies' infrastructures and network security/integrity so, needless to say, I am very confident I know what I am speaking of.  This file is clean as a whistle.
It's very likely you had a worm which attached itself to a currently running file, in your case, this .avi.  Usually a virus of this sort will attach to a service, executable or system file to fool the average computer user and numb-minding virus utensils... yet some ''hackers'' are idiots.  I've seen it all by this point.

Thanks for the concern and comments but I can guarantee this file was not to blame for your misfortune.

Thanks again to youngbull41 for the upload!"
,Pungo_SR,2008-02-21T09:57Z,"Ooo, lookie... pappa found a cookie!

,Pungo_SR,2008-02-21T10:17Z,"To clarify something... here is an image of ''hoop you head''...

,seriesofidiots,2008-02-27T00:45Z,"Well, the same thing is happening to me.  The crashing of explorer.  I don't know a lot about computers but I do run through a router, firewall, and have a virus scanner.  

I don't blame the uploader...sometimes this shit just happens.  If someone would be kind enough to unpack them and then re-up that would be really cool."
,thechameleon86,2008-04-23T05:58Z,Movie played fine for me and good quality other then the numbers in the upper right corner. Now I just need to find episode 8. Thanks for the upload!
