This is a file I found on eMule. I really don't know what it is exactly or how to use    it or what version of MS Flight it's for, but here it is.

Avidyne Flightmax EX500 and EX5000 full install.

Maybe someone here at TPB could explain what it is, what it does, how to use it, and what version it's for?

On another note: does anyone here have the smaller version of Cargo Pilot that is about 286 meg in size?

Happy Flying :}
