,neosn4ke,2008-09-25T12:11Z,"Problem with this thing is that some idiot named files with too long names, so the path to your videos becomes too long and system doesnt see it. 

Try to rename folders (you cant rename files that system doesnt see, so folders are your only shot) to something short, like ""1"" for example. And in future download such long-named torrents to folders like ""C:\1""."
