Did you know :: In The Simpsons episode \"Catch \'Em If You Can\", Homer is traveling by air in first class and says \"Look at me, I\'m reading The Economist. Did you know Indonesia is at a crossroads?\" and when questioned by his wife, he simply replies \"It is!\" Four days later, with its customary dry wit, The Economist alluded to the quote, and published an article about Indonesia referring to the \"crossroads\". The title of the issue was \"Indonesia\'s Gambit\". About seven months later, The Economist ran a cover headline reading \"Indonesia at a Crossroads.\"
