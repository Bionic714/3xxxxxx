My bandwidth is being limited by my ISP, so it's gonna take a few days for anyone to get 100% of this, but there will be plenty of chances to get this if everyone helps with seeding when complete. :D"

,chrisjenson,2008-02-01T23:15Z,"I am new to this torrent thing. When I try download the file I get this message:

Problem connecting to tracker - HTTP Error 404: Not Found, (at fre feb 1 '08 @ 11:12:49 PM

Do people need to seed?

Thx"
,artytorrent,2008-02-02T00:00Z,"Hi Chris,
If other torrents are working for you (you've managed to bypass your firewall for example) then the connection to the tracker was probably down temporarily while TPB refreshed its list of active torrents, seeds and peers. Hopefully you got it working.
At the time of writing, this torrent is live and has 17 seeds and 28 peers, so you should be able to get it to come down the pipe fairly quickly. (It's a big one, though, so will take quite a while to get it all. The great thing about torrents, of course, is that they resume downloading wherever you left off whenever you re-connect.)"
,artytorrent,2008-02-02T00:04Z,"P.S. For my first few torrents, I used the loopstation.net tracker along with TPB, but loopstation is now dead, so you'll get an error regarding the lookup for that tracker. You can safely remove the loopstation reference in the torrent properties, as the TPB and sumotracker trackers are working fine."
,Shadowing,2008-05-31T13:09Z,"Hey Arty
