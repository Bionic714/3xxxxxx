This torrent contains the English language .mov videos for Steinberg's Internal Mixing Tutorial. AIRISO provided the original 2xDVD package. I've just cut it down to the English language clips to keep the filesize more manageable.

The videos are presented nice and cleanly and should help music producers to think in three dimensions when producing and mixing their music. Useful for beginners and as a refresher for experts. Although the clips refer to Cubase and Nuendo, the tips apply to ANY sequencer.

Be sure to check out my other torrents on loopstation.net and thepiratebay.org

Thanks, comments and requests always welcome.
