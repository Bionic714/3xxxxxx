Kryst the Conqueror - Deliver Us from Evil EP

I got this tape from a friend of mine.
Around 1990.
It is in mint condition and an 'original'.
For as far as that means anything.
The mp3-versions I found on the net are horrible.
So here's my gift to you.

This is a FLAC-version of the cassette of this EP.
Very rare.
Recorded through high-end soundcard.
No clean-up, raw 24-bit recording.

Track listing

1. "Thunder Thruster" â?? 3:57
2. "In God We Trust" â?? 5:01
3. "Trial Of The Soul" â?? 3:50
4. "March Of The Mega-Mites" â?? 6:19
5. "Spellbound" â?? 5:35
