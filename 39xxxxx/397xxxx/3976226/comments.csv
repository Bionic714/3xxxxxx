As a nube, I have a question: is it bad form to start a torrent, seed for a while and drop off, or will it go away? The reason I ask is that I have limited bandwidth and this computer is also used by me and my wife for our employment stuff."

If you use someting like uTorrent it runs quietly in the background and doesn't take much from the normal run of the computer, unlike some of the others that take all your speed away.  If you have to shut it down it will start seeding again when you turn the torrent client back on.  But don't move the files after they've dled or it won't be able to find them to keep seeding."

Hope you dont mind me telling you, for the future, dont make zip files, just add it in a form of directory, so people dont have to download the whole package even if they only want one of the files. :) Cheers!

and thanks again."
