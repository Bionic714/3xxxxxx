This is the new album from the new band Airbourne.  The first time I heard them was on their MySpace page, myspace.com/airbourne.  I immediately bought the CD on eBay the same day.  Every song is really good.  Has an AC/DC'ish sound to them.  I ripped it from an actual CD, so quality is of the best.  Please seed for as long humanly possible.  Thank You.  SupermanGTR
