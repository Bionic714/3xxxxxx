\"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is Death.\"Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½1 Corinthians 15:26

----

In the powerful new thriller from the author of the international bestseller 
The Last Templar, a geneticist & a CIA agent on a deadly quest to find the 
most dangerous book in the world discover a secret that has destroyed 
everyone in its path for centuries.

Naples, 1750. In the dead of night, three men with swords burst into the 
palazzo of a marquis. Their leader, the Prince of San Severo, accuses the 
marquis of being an imposter, & demands to know a secret only the marquis 
harbors. In the fight that ensues, the false marquis escapes over the 
rooftops of Naples, leaving behind a burning palazzo & a raging prince now 
obsessed with finding his quarry at any cost.

Baghdad, 2003. An army unit on a routine mission makes a horrifying 
discovery: a state-of-the-art, concealed lab where dozensÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½men, women, 
childrenÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½have died, the subjects of gruesome experiments. The mysterious 
scientist they were after, a man believed to be working on a bioweapon & 
known only as the hakeemÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½the doctorÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½escapes, taking with him the 
startling truth about his work. A puzzling clue is left behind: a circular symbol 
of a snake feeding on its own tail.

As the power of the symbol comes to light, revealing the centuries of 
destruction left in its wake, one unsuspecting woman stands at the center of 
a conspiracy that could change the world forever. In the masterful hands of 
international bestseller Raymond Khoury, the Sanctuary delivers the same 
rapid-fire suspense & provacative scholarship that made The Last Templar a 
coast-to-coast blockbuster.
