,GAVB,2008-01-13T18:22Z,"thanks alot :-) only thing is tho that mono when converted to stereo causes slight phasing in a standard software, what software do u recommend for convertin the mono files accuratley ?"
,artytorrent,2008-01-14T03:04Z,"I can't say I've ever had any problems playing mono WAVs in Acid, FL Studio or Cubase. The only time I've got the phasing effect is when playing stereo bass sounds through a mono channel. Cool Edit/Adobe Audition converts files perfectly accurately for me. I even wrote a batch script to do conversions in bulk. It was included in my first torrent."

,alblandine,2008-03-16T12:14Z,"Arty, first of all, thank you very much for seeding all those programs. I had a problem with Atmosphere (sorry about the ""off-topic""), it says something like ""Can't find authorisation, please contact your plugsound reseller"". What should I do? Thanks again!"
,joesgarage,2008-05-23T21:02Z,"Hi Arty,

Pretty new to this but I've downloaded most of your torrents and wanted you to know I leave almost all of them seeding.  I've always wanted to say thanks but wasn't sure about registering or what might happen.   In the past I've always struggled to find the right loops when writing but thanks to you this rarely happens now.  
Keep uploading my friend and I'll keep seeding.

Oh sorry one more thing:

How can I best protect myself for the powers that be?
I use Peer Guardian, keep in mind I'm new to this!"
,DavidDeath,2008-10-15T13:12Z,"Artytorrent - I cannot thank you enough for all of these great soundpools that you have put on here, it's an enormous help to me with making music.
I especially like the rock / industrial pack, as I hate dance music.
I was wondering if you happened to have any more guitar / electric bass / Real live drums etc - Rock or metal sounds that you could put on here, as I find it really difficult to find more industrial-type sounds - apart from the ones you have already kindly put on here for us all.
Any more metal / industrial / rock sounds would be very much appreciated!

Kind Regards,

David
