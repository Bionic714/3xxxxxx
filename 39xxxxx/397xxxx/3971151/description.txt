Hi there!

This sample CD is pretty much concerned with house/techno drumloops and oneshots, with a few synth bass and fx loops thrown in. Everything is set to go at 138bpm.
For this repack, I've removed the construction kit "mixes" as they were just simple compilations of the loops in each kit. Also removed duplicated bass drum loops.
Where appropriate, I've converted files to mono and all oneshots have been trimmed. All files are 44KHz normalised WaV files.

Many of the drum and percussion loops should fit straight into your electronic compositions without any further editing.

Enjoy!
