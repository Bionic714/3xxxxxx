,talytal,2008-02-25T02:23Z,We need another seeder please.  I can promise to seed 200% once I have the whole thing. 
,talytal,2008-02-29T17:00Z,okay now my ratio is 3.9 and I still am only at 98.6%.   I'm connected to about 20 people who are also at 98.6%.  if someone with the full file could just connect for an hour or two we'd have all of it.

In order to help others, I will feed it for some days, if anyone want me to send it by IM tools, just tell me:  j.wan#live.com(change # to @), 
I will send this Season through the internet, and make more feed to others."
