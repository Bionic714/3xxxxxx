"
,peeweesweden,2008-01-11T05:13Z,"Wow. Even if you have, say 500 people online 24/7, the server's gonna be emptier than a pizzabox at a Weight Watcher's convention. The real deal costs you less than 50 cent a day. "
,peeweesweden,2008-01-11T05:16Z,"OMG LOL, I just peeked at your stats.... ONE player online? 15 registered accounts at the forum? And then the server died. *giggle*"

,Creedo16,2008-01-13T00:32Z,few times i have tried your links they dont seem to work...
,Danbannan,2008-01-14T11:35Z,"Im sorry for this, its currently being difficult to provide this site for a few days because of some digging outside my appartment. I will be back up again fast. Im sorry for this inconvenience."
,Danbannan,2008-01-14T21:18Z,"Ok we have done a MAJOR upgrade, the server is now a 3.0Ghz quadcore running with 4GB ram (upgrade to 8GB if it gets populated) and it will be for free.. the servers capacity now upped dramatically. me as the provider are thinking of upgrading the connection as well so there will be NO lag. The server are down until tomorrow but the registration page and forums are up, the download also are up but on a much cheaper connection than usual. im sorry for this and i will get this fixed in the next 24 hours.. tnx"
,britscott,2008-01-20T19:20Z,"Your server is down. Will it be back up? Is it possible to use another private server, even with this download?"
