Plot outline:
This is the story of a mild-mannered bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss, who has just discovered a mysterious ancient green wooden mask by the sea that is inhabited by Loki, the Norse night god of mischief. But when Stanley puts on the mask, he transforms into an uncontrolled wacky-suited green-skinned cartoony manic superhero "The Mask" that does the craziest things and amazes people in search of justice and a good time too.
