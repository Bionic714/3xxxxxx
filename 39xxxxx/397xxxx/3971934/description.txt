The last of the Richard Bachman novels, recently recovered & published for 
the first time. Stephen King's "dark half" may have saved the best for last.

----

A fellow named Richard Bachman wrote Blaze in 1973 on an Olivetti 
typewriter, then turned the machine over to Stephen King, who used it to 
write Carrie. Bachman died in 1985 ("cancer of the pseudonym"), but in late 
2006 King found the original typescript of Blaze among his papers at the 
University of Maine's Fogler Library ("How did this get here?!"), & decided 
that with a little revision it ought to be published.

Blaze is the story of Clayton Blaisdell, Jr.?of the crimes committed against 
him & the crimes he commits, including has last, the kidnapping of a baby heir 
worth millions. Blaze has been a slow thinker since childhood, when his father 
threw him down the stairs?& then threw him down again. After escaping an 
abusive institution for boys when he was a teenager, Blaze hooks up with 
George, a seasoned criminal who thinks he has all the answers. But then 
George is killed, & Blaze, though haunted by his partner, is on his own.

He becomes one of the most sympathetic criminals in all of literature. This is a 
crime story of surprising strength & sadness, with a suspenseful current 
sustained by the classic workings of fate & character?as taut & riveting as 
Stephen King's The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.

----

In his "lifetime," Richard Bachman published five novels. A sixth, The 
Regulators, was published after he died of pseudonym cancer (a relatively 
painless way to go) in 1985. He developed a cult following both before & 
after his death. Two of his novels (Thinner & The Running Man) were made 
into motion pictures. This novel?both brutal & sensitive?is his final legacy.

Ron McLarty has appeared on Broadway in That championship Season, Our 
Country's Good, & Moonchildren. His film credits include Two Bits, The 
Postman, & The Flamingo Kid. On television he starred in Spenser for Hire & 
Cop Rock. Mr. McLarty is an award winning playwright & the author of the 
acclaimed novel The Memory of Running.
