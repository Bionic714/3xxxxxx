November 22, 1963. The Kennedy Assasination is a day that changed the political and social direction of the United States. These files are the complete audio broadcast day of WLW Cincinatti, 700Khz AM starting at about 5:45AM and running to about 1AM the next day. There is also a portion of the next day (11-23-63) starting at 5:45AM and running to 1PM. 


11-23-63 Part 4, Appx. 10 minutes into this file is where the coverage begins.

Recorded with a Soundscribe S124 Logger-Recorder. This is the ENTIRE day of coverage, beginning with the normal broadcast (farm reports/music) at the beginning of the day and continuing with as much as (normal) possible throughout the day. Remember the time before you comment on the wierd musical choices.

The Soundscribe was designed to record voice as a QOS system, so the musical selections may sound a little wierd.
