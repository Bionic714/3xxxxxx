The overall effect is that the music sounds rather tinny, but for the most part, the voice is very clear and has little artifacting. There are some places where the tape has some had some problem, either mis-track during recording or other problems, like head wear or tape wear, but the overall program is intact and listenable."

Searches for ""kennedy assasination"" , ""wlw cincinatti and everything else I can think of turn up nothing.  Finally found it in my browser's history, one more day and I wouldn't have been able to find it.  

It needs to be more accessible."

It recorded the audio feed on a SLOW moving, wide tape with a rotating head system. Synchronization was, um, yeah...which is why the music is of poor quality. 24 hours of broadcast on a single reel of tape..."
