This is a demo recording of The Little Mermaid Musical before it arrived on Broadway.  I\'ve included Part Of Your World at the end as for some reason it was not recorded as part of the demo recording.  The cast is as follows:

Ariel: Kerry Butler
Eric: Gavin Creel
Ursula: Emily Skinner
King Triton: Jeff McCarthy
Scuttle: Buddy Hackett
Flounder: Michaeal McGrath
Louis: Joe Farrell

Enjoy
