Title: Classical Gas

Brent is surprised to meet a member of the Leroy clan that he didn't even know existed. Wanda finds that she needs some help from an unexpected source in order to prove her abilities in math. Lacey makes some additions to the menu at The Ruby, much to Davis's delight.

Note: This is the real season 5 episode 8, although the capper even labelled it episode 9. We all agree it is 'Classical Gas' though.
