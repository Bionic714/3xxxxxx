,OmniVega,2008-08-05T07:36Z,thx man awsome quality and good music. and very fast download lol. but thanks again for the awsome dl of a great band
,forgetclosure,2008-08-11T16:44Z,"@jblue117
it's not retarted at all. It's helping a musician you love make more music so you can enjoy them for longer. if everyone downloaded music and never bought any do you think there would be even a quarter as many bands around? i don't think so at all.. even if bands didn't do it for the money they still wouldn't be able to concentrate on music. They'd have to have jobs and keep themselves up.. AND pay for equipment.. so if you REALLY like a band, go out and support them."
,abbadon666,2008-09-12T01:25Z,thanx my girl is gonna suck the shit outta my dick 4 this album
,smmiller506,2008-10-26T15:11Z,"Well, thank god for bands like Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, who promote their music for free instead of charging for it."
,WhiteCarrion,2008-10-27T00:54Z,"Secondhand Serenade is amazing. Though, I'm not just going to be a fucking fangirl and buy all of his albums. The point of this is to see how they sound beforehand, or just to get free stuff. If I like it then I will definitely buy it. I'm not buying a CD I'm not sure I like. 

I do have the first CD, I'm using this to DL the second. So stop bitching. This site is about freedom anyway."
,Dea7hReaper,2009-05-24T00:21Z,Oh My God. The download wont finish. It keeps bouncing at 109.?? and it don't download!!!

,kiraaa_,2009-06-20T05:38Z,"Thanks, reasonably fast. Good quality :)"
,1337Sox,2009-06-20T17:42Z,"@forgetclosure

I go to their shows.  That's how they make most of their money anyway.  And you can't like a band if you don't give their record company money?"
,project_x41,2009-07-20T12:43Z,thanks.
,hearyouful,2009-08-05T22:53Z,many thanks man :)
,yomomma7826,2010-07-11T07:38Z,"man this downloaded amazingly fast, thank you :)"
,kitkatarn,2012-03-02T01:37Z,"Most of the money from Albums go to producers and record companies. Bands make most of their money off of their live shows. And fyi, the music industry conducted a study that they refuse to publish because it shows that people that torrent spend more money on band merch, concerts and music than people that don't. I for one buy an album every now and then but I attend at least 5 - 10 concerts a year. And I have a shirt from almost every one of them, some of them I even buy the album off the band at the show. I saw Secondhand Serenade in concert and love the guys music. Just cause I download doesn't mean I'm not supporting him in other ways. Stop buying the music industries bs. "
,kitkatarn,2012-03-02T01:38Z,Great Torrent btw. Thanks a mil.
