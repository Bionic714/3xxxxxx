Stewart Lee: What's Wrong With Blasphemy?
In this programme comedian Stewart Lee hits back at the Christian fundamentalists who tried to shut down his satirical musical 'Jerry Springer the Opera', asking why we allow a tiny minority to impose their values on the rest of us. Lee warns that a society that loses the ability to poke fun at sacred cows is not a place most of us would want to live.
