One thing, however. Are you using some kind of audio cleanup software on some of theses rips? The Duke Ellington rips youve been posting are just horrible - with boxy, muffled sound, like a 32k mp3. A lot of details are completely lost. For example, the banjo is completely gone from most of the recordings. I got hold of a different rip of the Duke Ellington Brunswick, Vocalion, Melotone recording, and while theres a significant amount of noise from the old 78 records, the details of the orchestra are also a lot more audible. 

These recordings were made in the twenties on 78 rpm records. Hiss and scratches are just something one has to live with. Please leave audio restauration to the pros and post these fantastic, hard to find recordings as they have been released on cd"
,flipthefrog,2008-01-26T01:47Z,"I'll add to this, a huge amount of early Ellington releases contain truly terrible transfers, so I guess the quality of Valaida's releases depend on what cds he's ripped.  By far the best versions available of most of the classic tracks are on the Duke Ellington Centennial Edition box set. They do have the most 78 record surface noise, but that allows you to hear details that are completely lost in other releases. Just compare the awful 3-cd set The Blanton Webster Band with the exact same recordings on Centennial Edition"
