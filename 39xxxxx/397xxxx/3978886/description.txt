"Eisler is one of the most talented and literary writers in the thriller genre."
?Chicago Sun-Times

Hunted and finally cornered, John Rain faces his deadliest enemy ever: 
himself.

For John Rain, "the most charismatic assassin since James Bond" (San 
Francisco Chronicle), getting out of the life was never going to be easy. But 
with a new identity in Paris, and the help of his lover, Mossad agent Delilah, 
he was beginning to leave the killing business behind.

And then he receives a message from rogue CIA operative Jim Hilger: We 
have your friend Dox. Do as we tell you, or the former Marine sniper dies.

For a professional like Rain, the choice ought to be easy: do the job?a series 
of three hits?and save his friend and partner. But how does Rain know that 
Hilger won't kill Dox anyway, once the assignment is complete? How does he 
know that each of the hits isn't simultaneously a setup for Rain himself? Most 
of all, how can he control the killing rage that Hilger's lethal game of extortion 
reignites inside him?

From the deceptively tranquil beaches of Bali, to the backstreets and 
boulevards of Paris, to the urban canyons of Silicon Valley and New York and 
the old killing fields of Vietnam, Rain must grapple with his age, with his 
enemies, and most of all, with the killer inside himself?in a battle that not 
even Rain, "the stuff great characters are mode of" (Entertainment Weekly), 
can hope to survive intact.
