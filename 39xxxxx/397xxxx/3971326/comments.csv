,n7dmcd,2008-03-17T14:26Z,"The quality of this is very good. However, because of the large size of this file, I had to burn it as a UDF file, and have since discovered that this type of file system won't play on my standalone dvd player.
Does anyone know how to burn this to a disc that will play on a standalone player?
Thx"

Andrei's faith in the Troitsa (trinity) holds the film together, and your great love for the filmmaker holds you riveted to your seat. 
Undoubtedly, the greatest film ever made. So realistic it could pass for a documentary. "

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3955351/Andrei_Rublev_Director_s_Cut_DVDrip

That rip also has audio commentary which might be useful as the film is somewhat complicated and abstract."
