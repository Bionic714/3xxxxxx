,animemattw,2008-02-02T09:43Z,I'm a bit confused as to how this works.  My phone says that it needs a security ticket for Sim City at least so is there a crack in the files that I've missed?  And what are the Z02 files for?
,stemoss,2008-03-01T19:46Z,"WTF man!!! Why can't you just compress the files with zip or rar? How do i expand this fucking format? I use OSX, and i don't know witch app. to use.,."
,lorabutterfly,2008-03-20T09:46Z,its a split file archive you just extract the zip file at the bottom
,Darndare,2008-03-22T20:20Z,stemoss. OSX?! And then U use the PPC when you actually want to do something useful? :o)
,need4speed,2008-04-16T08:59Z,Corrupt ... can't extract.  Reseed do not download

,Junx,2008-07-24T21:25Z,"Extracting this on Linux (at least via the command line) or Mac OS X is a bit of a hassle, so I thought I'd share how to do it until un/zip fully handles multipart files.

cat * >ppc-essentials.zip
zip -F ppc-essentials.zip
unzip ppc-essentials.zip

There you go.  Works fine."

If so will it work on a HTC Shadow running Windows 5, well atleast some of them?
