Thanks for this great upload. Great quality (both audio and video). Totally worth the download (and seeding). 
I just need to burn this so I can give to my father... and I usually use Image Burner to burn this kind of file but since it's size is 6.6 GiB it won't do it. I'd appreciate your help!

P.S.: Geez I feel like a noob asking you that question 'cause I must have a simple aswer... but still... I need help! Any1?"
