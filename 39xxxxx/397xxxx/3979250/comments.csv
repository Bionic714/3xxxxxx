[T],_Maelstrom_,2008-04-02T04:48Z,"s_f_s, as stated in the nfo, the audio codec is AC3. This is available from sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ac3filter) or it comes in any of the major codec packs. Alternately you can download VLC Player (http://www.videolan.org/vlc) which contains it's own playback filters, to view the video."

Thank you very much. I should have specified that I was using an Intel Mac. A simple google search easily got me what I needed. Here is a very convenient codec bundle for Quick Time users.

,spanish_for_shark,2008-04-03T14:53Z,The quality is EXCELLENT. Thanks!
,spanish_for_shark,2008-04-20T23:11Z,"On second thought, I'd really like it if the volume was a bit louder. Is there something I can do to adjust the volume of the files my altering the metadata of them, like I would to change the tag on an mp3?"
[T],_Maelstrom_,2008-04-22T05:35Z,"I do not know with a MAC, for a PC the AC3 codec allows you to adjust the gain.
