 * COVER SYNOPSIS                                                     *
 *  Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones light a fuse under this action-  *
 *  packed "tension-filled, edge-of-the-seat thriller which will hold *
 *  you hostage for 120 electrifying minutes."  Fueled with dynamic   *
 *  support by Lloyd Bridges, Forest Whitaker, and Suzy Amis, Blown   *
 *  Away is the action film you don't want to miss. When an explosion *
 *  jolts Boston, bomb squad expert Jimmy Dove is thrust into the most*
 *  harrowing work of his career.  Evidence points to a bomber more   *
 *  dangerous and skilled than any he's ever faced - except one.  The *
 *  possibility that the terrorist is his former menter increases the *
 *  stakes - and as his friends and family are unsuspectingly drawn   *
 *  into the action, Jimmy is forced to face not only his bitter enemy*
 *  but also his haunting past.                                       *
