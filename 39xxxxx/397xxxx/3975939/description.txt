A Day To Remember
Fun. I think with all the atrocities and seriousness in the music industry these days with band feuds and band civil wars there arenâ??t many bands around that seem like they are in it for the fun. This is the first release/band in awhile that Iâ??ve come to terms with that I feel like the band is having fun with what they do and these guys in this band feel like they grew up as a kid who loved music just like any of us. I could throw out formulas and genre bull*** that probably the first thing that comes to anyoneâ??s mind but who invented the rules anyway? A Day To Remember is a band much like Set Your Goals which has the furious, fast, fun, influences of modern day pop-punk and combines it with crushing breakdowns and hardcore pace screaming/chanting. For all of the music elitists out there, this is simply a nightmare. Itâ??s just a known thing that a lot of people who like pop-punk and alternative rock isnâ??t so much for screaming, hardcore vocals (even though times have changed) and itâ??s most definite then most of the hardcore and metal core kids cant stand the â??whiningâ?? in pop-punk. Itâ??s a genre clash, and itâ??s an interesting mix for a band to bring to the table. Another band thatâ??s hitting it off big is doing the same thing and a lot of people are in love with them, they are known as Set Your Goals. Already though if youâ??re a huge Set Your Goals fan you wonâ??t need to read any longer because this will be your nirvana. For those who are non-believers or just those who are ignorant to the differences in genres, open up your ears to probably the music industries next big cash in.
