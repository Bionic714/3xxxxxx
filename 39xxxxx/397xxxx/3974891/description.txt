This documentary presents a look at the innovative Canadian circus troupe that revolutionized the circus genre. Cirque du Soleil first came on the scene in the 1980s. Combining elements of street theater with traditional circus performance, these former street performers have dazzled millions of people with their repertoire of dance, acrobatics, and music, all presented by characters known as baroques. With imaginative costumes depicting fanciful animals, the circus of the sun has captured the hearts of many new circus goers. This program captures the magic of Cirque du Soleil on film,
