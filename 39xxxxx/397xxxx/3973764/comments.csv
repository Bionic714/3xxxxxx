I even had 3 different keygens for Norton, McAfee, Kaspersky and AVG and generated close to 100 different serials and all of them were bad.

NOD32 is a good av software because it runs in the background and doesn't use as many system resources as Norton and McAfee.  It's worth purchasing a license for...I would avoid Kaspersky and AVG since they don't even catch the viruses geared towards Norton and McAfee"
