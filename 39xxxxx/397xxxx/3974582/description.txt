Artwork included (I scanned color copies mailed to me when I traded for the disc long ago; if you have the bootleg, I would appreciate getting HQ scans of the original artwork, please contact me on a Patti mailing list).  There is alternative artwork at http://www.postmodern.com/~fi/pattipics/htm/askthe.htm but their back cover lacks side-flaps.

*Note*
Including this version of excerpts of Patti's 26 March 1978 show there are eight versions I know of, four of which I have including the pre-FM one running at http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=171832

I did a comparison of the four versions I have.  (I've attached to a Comment a link containing a jpeg of these 4 versions; spectral analysis on the top, peaks on the bottom, the other pre-FM torrent on the left, the boots "Ask The Angels", "Live In Paris", and "Exodus" are 2nd, 3rd, and 4th from the left.)

As you can see from the line on the two to the right, they appear to be post-FM.  And the dimeadozen torrent and this "Ask The Angels" torrent appear to be pre-FM.

"Exodus" has poor sound quality.  "Live In Paris" is better, but not good.  IMO this torrent of the boot "Ask The Angels" is a bit better, clearer than the other pre-FM torrent.  I think this torrent is superior, but it's close, YMMV.

However, this torrent does not contain the complete Paris show.  Someday someone might collect all the versions and create a complete "best" version.  I might possibly find time to do that one of these years.  Note that it wouldn't be allowed at dimeadozen.org
