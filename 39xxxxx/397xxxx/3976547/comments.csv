,JimmyTheGent,2008-01-18T09:10Z,"Brand new to Linux, what is the best version? This seems to be the newest and most popular torrent.   Is this x86 and x64?
Thanks, Jimmy"
,JimmyTheGent,2008-01-18T12:55Z,"never mind. 
I'm trying Sabayon first."
,uhsarp,2008-01-18T18:14Z,it's 32-bit
,aTanCS,2008-01-19T20:29Z,Why is it Exclusive?
,JimmyTheGent,2008-01-20T01:48Z,I could not get the ISO to extract
,uhsarp,2008-01-20T23:25Z,"@JimmyTheGent 

Don't try to extract the ISO file. try to burn it to a DVD using Nero/Magic Iso or any other burning software.

For Nero, click on file->open (select the ISO file) and then burn it.

@ aTanCS

Well ...ony 5 CD version of RHEL 5 is available. The is the only DVD version (other than the one or two releases found on the internet)"
,adrak,2008-01-24T17:29Z,thanks !!!  I will seed it till u post another update for this
,tipu2185,2008-01-27T09:22Z,What is its serial No.????
,blackmantis1,2008-01-28T11:57Z,"This dvd is not bootable. Does anyone have any info on how to make it bootable.

Thanks"
,uhsarp,2008-01-28T23:16Z,"@blackmantis1 

The DVD is bootable. Just don't extract the ISO. burn it directly using Nero or MagicIso and use it. If you're still having problems, then open the boot.iso file with magicIso, extract the contents of the DVD iso and add them to the boot.iso (already opened in MagicISo), save the image with a new name and you can use it instead!"
,blackmantis1,2008-01-29T03:44Z,"@uhsarp
Thanks for your reply! I burned the iso and it didnt work in 2 different systems. I also extracted the iso with poweriso and recreated and burned with the same result. Both systems boot fine with my Solaris and SuSe install dvds. I downloaded the 5cd's and it boots fine. Thanks for your help."
,AkashKalgude,2008-01-30T06:17Z,doesnt boot for me either.
,AkashKalgude,2008-01-30T23:31Z,"well, it does show bootable but it sure didnt boot.
i burned the .iso using nero, now im burning it with magiciso. i'll let u know what happens.
i've got my fingers crossed."
,WaR2k,2008-01-31T00:04Z,"Same thing for me. It shows ""bootable"" but it doesn't work. I tried burning it with nero (first time) and I tried with magic iso after that (rebuilt) and it still doesn't boot."
,AkashKalgude,2008-01-31T05:42Z,"kz, burned it with MagicISO, still doesnt boot. i dont understand whats the problem, has it got something to do with the drive???"
,blackmantis1,2008-02-02T01:24Z,"Tried booting just the iso file with VMWARE and its not detected. There is something wrong with this ISO I would love to get it working so i can load vmware test server.

Thanks"
,tipu2185,2008-02-03T10:28Z,"Ok I found the installation No. so share with you guyz
2515dd4e215225dd
For me bootable DVD so enjoy"
,evil_stroker,2008-02-05T08:25Z,It's working fine with VMWare. Use the iso image directly with VMWare or burn it if you want to install it onto a physical Machine.
,evil_stroker,2008-02-05T08:31Z,"@gmeanie

Even if you manage to get a Serial Number somewhere from the internet, it's gonna get blocked soon as it spreads everywhere. So there's no point in using it. If you insist on updates, refer to CentOs repo. It's the opensource clone of RHEL."
,d0wnl0ader,2008-02-10T14:21Z,"it working great with VMware and i am sure it would work with dvd installation as well if you know how to burn it first in dvd.

i thought that linux is open source but the redhat cost you alot of money? it sucks . atleast they shouldnt block the installation number :_("
