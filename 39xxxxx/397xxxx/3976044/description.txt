Masters of Science Fiction is an American television anthology series, created by the same creators as Masters of Horror. The show debuted on ABC on August 4, 2007 at 10PM for a run of four episodes.It was originally scheduled to run in six parts, but two episodes were removed from the schedule for undisclosed reasons.
