Did I do something wrong?"
,shanghaid,2008-01-14T13:51Z,"HOLLER!!!

Please up all you can. I need to learn more.

??!"
,shanghaid,2008-01-14T13:56Z,"I'm trying to dload this now. There are 7 others also trying to dload it but no one is seeding.

You have to be online to up it. You might not be able to be online 24/7 but if you make it available when you can, others will dload it and seed and we can all get it.

Make sure to allow PEX (peer exchange) so if we get part of it that others don't have, we can share it amongst ourselves.

Xie Xie!"
,DaoBan,2008-01-14T14:15Z,"I'm here, I'm TRYING to upload, but it's not working.  I don't know why.

Firewall rules or something?  

I'm going to try something then try to upload a new version of the same file.

Look for the new torrent, and we'll see how that goes."
,DaoBan,2008-01-14T14:22Z,"Well..   no new torrent necessary.

Seems to be working now.  I see people downloading.  

Yay!

More to come in the days and weeks that follow ;)"
,shanghaid,2008-01-14T23:30Z,"Looking good now DB.

I'm seeing 6 full seeders & 26 known (seeders/leechers).

Success!

Look forward to seeing some of your other dloads.

Thanks again (zai xie)"
