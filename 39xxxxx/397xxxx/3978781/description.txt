Fake Voice is a tiny application which does exactly what its name says - it changes the sound of your voice. I can?t really think of a meaningful use for this application apart from hiding your real tone of voice at some online dating site and making fun of your friends through Skype, but may be some of you need to stay little anonymous and will find this software useful.

Fake Voice is a voice changer software which changes your voice to male, female, old, young, hard, shrill, or some one new. If you are female and want to sound like male or if you are male and want to sound like male, this is your tool. You can apply robotic effect to sound like alien or echo effect to sound like you speaking from a well or tunnel.

Whether you like you have fun with your friends or you want to improve your voice quality for audio recording, this tool give you full control over your voice.
