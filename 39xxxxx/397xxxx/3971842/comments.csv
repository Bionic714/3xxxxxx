The registration is needed only for one thing - if you haven?t already registered StarBurn the Registration Software dialog appears every time you connect a remote iSCSI device.  But is higly unlikely that you will want to remotely use my DVD burner :-D If so you will have to buy a license ;-)"

Thanks."
