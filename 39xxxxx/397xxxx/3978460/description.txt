If you've been following DJ Kay Slay aka. The Drama King's mixtape series 'R&B Models' or his street DVDs, you know Kay is in with some of the streets' sexiest models. From video vixens to pin-ups to print models to just straight phat-azz dimepieces, Slay always brings you the baddest bit*hes in the hip-hop industry. One of the first to help put Buffie The Body on the street DVD map, Kay Slay and Sub-Zero put the cameras on that dump truck of an ass during Kay Slay's Birthday celebration a couple years back. Bottom line: Slay fu*ks with the baddest.

Enter the everyday of a DIMEPIECE...Witness these beautiful women's careers as models, adult entertainers and performers on DVD as Kay Slay brings you up close with every dime he can find. Featuring Buffie The Body, Maliah, Spinderella, Gloria Velez, Pretty, Lyric, Simorah, Pillowz and Tayo among others, this DVD catches up with every dimepiece in sight. Also featuring appearances from Slay's celebrity buddies, you'll also find the likes of Papoose, Remy Martin, Busta Rhymes and others stopping by to lend their support for the Drama King (and mess with the dimepieces).
