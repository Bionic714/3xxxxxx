Forty-two years after her first visit in Tokyo, Mothra returns to warn mankind that they must return Mechagodzilla, along with Godzilla's bones, to the sea, for the dead must not be disturbed. If not, dire consequences will follow. However, Godzilla is once again on the rampage, and Mechagodzilla is Japan's only defense.  Written by Oliver Chu

-A good movie if you like to see men in rubber suits beating the shit out of each other.  It's the English-dub version because I couldn't figure out how to rip with the subtitles.
