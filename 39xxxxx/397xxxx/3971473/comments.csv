,greasetrap,2008-01-11T07:27Z,"I will, don't worry.  Everybody's going to have to be patient for a little while because I seed from my university which imposes strict bandwidth-limitations to discourage file sharing.  And remember, once you get the full copy...KEEP SEEDING!!!"
,bogartrules,2008-01-11T11:31Z,"i am loving these movies your putting up m8 keep it up ill seed if i ever get them done LOLOLOLOL bloody bummer on the bandwidth cap LOL shit happens but keep up these rare movies tank girl , barbaella rocks LOL "
,greasetrap,2008-01-11T21:32Z,"Yeah, glad to hear that you like them.  Unfortunately I'll be slowing down a little bit because I just got around to figuring out how to rip DVDs and ripped them when I was home over Christmas break, but now I'm back in a small town and don't have as steady access to renting DVDs, however I have a few good ones coming up before you need to wait as well as a re-seed of a JamesKee torrent of ""Taoism Drunkard"", one of the weirdest Kung Fu movies of all time.

send me requests (doubtful I'll be able to go to the video store for a little while now, but if something goes down and needs a re-seed e-mail me there too or just friend me on myspace).  "
