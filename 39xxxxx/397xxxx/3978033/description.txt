Final Fantasy IX (PSX) fully converted to PSP format.  This will only work on PSP's with custom firmware.


This has been fully tested on Firmware 3.71 M33 and 3.40 OE and works perfect.  It should work on older
custom firmware as well, but I have not personally tested it.




Instructions:


1.   Unrar images (EBOOT.PBP)

2.   Copy EBOOT.PBP to :\PSP\GAME     If it isn't there, create the directory on your own.
     (You may put it in a subfolder if you'd like.  e.g :\PSP\GAME\FF9)

3.   Copy KEYS.BIN into the same folder that you put EBOOT.PBP in.  
     (I've had it work without this file, but you will probably need it. It's not included. Try Google)

3.   Boot your PSP and go to the "Game" folder and choose "Memory Stick"

4.   (Optional)  If you would like to view the instruction manual in-came, copy DOCUMENT.DAT
     to the same folder mentioned above.  Press the "HOME" button to access it.

5.   (Not optional)  Rock out!




Notes:


Keep the same save file when you change disks.  The GameID is already setup.
