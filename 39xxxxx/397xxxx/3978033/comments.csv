,whiteboy100,2008-09-17T15:01Z,Do you think it will work on a 3.80 firmware?
,flamingfuzzy,2009-06-30T06:26Z,"To anyone with Copywrite infringement: You need custom firmware. Google it.

To in5ult080t: Yes. If you keep your hacked battery, and a magic memory stick(the way I did it), you can do the exact same thing in reverse. Remove the custom firmware, and replace it with official firmware"

,Seymroth,2009-11-13T21:05Z,"Xtshock:
Propably you have a setting wrong in the Recovery mode(If you have CFW).
Completely shutdown the decide(from the select-menu or by simply holding the power button down long enough.
Now, hold the R button down and turn the power on. You will go to a black screen with red text if done correctly. Then, select configuration and press x once on the option with the ""UMD required"" or etc..
Hope this helps."
