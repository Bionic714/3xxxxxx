> one question though, is there anyway you could take out that music between shows and just jump right from one show to another?

There is, but the torrent wouldn't be up until 6 Eastern. Right now it's as early as 1, usually 5 the latest. On a few occasions when I've been able to it's been my source, but usually I'm just passing on someone else's efforts and editing is hindered by limited access. Sorry. Maybe BostonJoe will start posting again. "

Thanks for posting these.  One day, the boys will be gone and you will live forever through these delicious posts.

Got any old shows for 1998 or 1999?
