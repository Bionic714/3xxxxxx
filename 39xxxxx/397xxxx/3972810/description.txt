"MAMP PRO" is the commercial, professional grade version of the classic local server environment for OS X: MAMP. Designed for professional web developers and programmers, MAMP PRO allows easy installation and administration of their development environment under Mac OS X.
As a professional web developer you have to test your programs in detail. In addition, you need a highlyconfigurable developing environment with all the components also used by most ISPs: Apache, MySQL and PHP in the latest stable versions. No matter whether you want to test your latest Ajax creation, or realize a new page with webEdition: MAMP PRO supports you during the tests of your developments.
