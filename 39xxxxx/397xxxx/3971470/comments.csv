[T],_Maelstrom_,2008-01-11T06:37Z,It would be nice if you could list the details of this release here or make an nfo we can dl. A program like GSpot (http://www.headbands.com/gspot) or MediaInfo (http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net) can give you the files audio and video information.
,greasetrap,2008-01-11T07:30Z,"Cool, thanks for the tip.  I'll look into that for future reference.  Oh, and a somebody commented on another torrent that it wasn't seeding, it'll come around, don't worry."

send me requests (doubtful I'll be able to go to the video store for a little while now, but if something goes down and needs a re-seed e-mail me there too or just friend me on myspace).  "
