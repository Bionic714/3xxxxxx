,artytorrent,2008-01-14T03:26Z,"This torrent is based on Elab's ""Nu Directions - Phuture Sounds of House"" sample CD, which mainly contains construction kits. I've recategorized the loops because otherwise you just end up recreating the demos. The files starting with PA and a number are from the construction kits and will be in key with others of similar numbers and with the same ""group"" name. For example, PA0103m_mLp125-Epi_Rhodes Josty will go perfectly with PA0104m_mLp125-Gtr_Jazzy Josty and PA0106m_bLp125-Bass_Josty.
I much prefer to experiment, however, and come up with something original by mixing and matching random loops, or use a bass loop from this set, with a Rhodes loop from a different CD and a drumloop or two from another. Sometimes key-clashes create a funkier sound with more interesting chord progressions. (Sometimes they just create a cacophony, though!)
If you only used sounds from this CD, you'd end up with really predictable stuff. Gotta mix and match... ;)"

,RemyZ,2008-06-29T05:22Z,"haha yes its exactly as you say,i always collect as many samples as well(still gonna upload em when i know how to do it right)often cd's and downloads from timespace and then i start messing around with all kinda samples and riffs of all styles and its more satisfying..i wish i could make it all by myself but okay..question though,are you planning to upload BalkanLines from Ueberschall?since GTA4 balkan dance is winning popularity(im not kidding)so i was curious;)"
