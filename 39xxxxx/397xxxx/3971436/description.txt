G'day from the Australia Zoo, where the Wiggles get wild with Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin. It's a Wiggly Safari: 55 jaw-snappin', kookaburra-hootin', dolphin-splashin' minutes of grand adventure. A big ham himself, Irwin meshes naturally with the tuneful quartet as they sing, dance, and share factual tidbits about cockatoos, crocodiles, emus, and more. Colors pop off the screen as Dorothy, Captain Feathersword, and little dancers cavort through the zoo. Packed with 16 snappy tunes, this particular Wiggles collection revs up the tempo from earlier titles like Wiggle Time and Toot! Toot! Could this lush outdoor setting, where songs like "Dingo Tango" and "Cocky Want a Cracker" sizzle in the sunshine, be responsible for inspiring this ultra-imaginative play list? Or perhaps Irwin's invigorating presence stimulated the fresh, lively feel of this exceptional show. Regardless, Wiggles fans from ages 1 to 8 will surely delight in this musical tour of the Australia Zoo.
