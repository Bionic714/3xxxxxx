[T],Sakrilege,2008-01-11T06:02Z,"Get your facts straight Falleen_Fan_No_1.

1.) this isn't a request thread.
2.) buy the damned book since these scanners are so slow.
3.) and this is the fragging kicker, #60 is due out JANUARY 30TH. Do a little research next time."

In re request thread - it would probably be more helpful to tell him where it is."

,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-01-18T14:27Z,"sorry guys.  last time i had checked, it was supposed to be out on the 2nd, so i was wondering where it was.  And i can't buy the book, because the country i live in doesn't have a comic shop!"

Thanks."
