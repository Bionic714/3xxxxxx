,EzeRoss,2008-01-14T17:06Z,"Roy is on his way to you now. Congratulations on joining the uploaders. It is trickling very slowly with one in Netherlands on 99.5% and another couple and myself on about 3.5%. Will let you know if it plays ok at this end. A little advice for future uploads.  Zip individual files using the MP3+G Toolz in the karaoke kit uploaded a few days ago. Then just upload the folder with the individual files in it instead of RARing it.  You will find it easier for those who don't want the whole lot and it is more likely to be seeded in the open format cos you don't have to open it to use it. 
If you Google for PRINT FOLDER you will be able to d/l a small utility that will list the contents of a folder. This will save you having to type out the contents list.
