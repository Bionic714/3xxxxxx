_____________________________________________________________Summary__

Piracy In The Straits looks at piracy in the Straits of Malacca and 
asks what will happen if international terrorists become involved. 
Each year 50,000 ships pass through the Straits: the world's 
principal shipping channel. They carry goods from China, fuel to 
China and US war supplies to the Middle East. Piracy is rife: in 
2003, 445 ships were attacked and 93 people were killed. This 
documentary examines how the conditions in the impoverished islands 
of Indonesia have been used by piracy as the perfect base. The 
program seeks to unveil who is involved, how they go about their 
business and how the laissez-faire attitude of the authorities has 
allowed piracy to continue. Piracy In The Straits also looks at 
what might happen if these pirates are recruited by terrorists. 
Tugs and barges have already been kidnapped by pirates and filled 
with mines, while a chemical tanker has been kidnapped by pirates 
in order to know more about its navigational capabilities. The 
program also looks at what the consequences would be if a tanker 
were taken over by terrorists and blown up in Singapore, the 
world's largest port.
