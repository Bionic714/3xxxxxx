,BitCountZero,2008-01-15T13:40Z,nevermind... figured it out
,stoneand,2008-01-15T15:32Z,Crack doesn't work in Tiger. Still asks for CD. Also asks for 300 mb more disk space when there's plenty of free disk space. Bizarre...
,stoneand,2008-01-16T01:06Z,"Got it to work this way: You've got to copy all files to a new folder in your Applications folder.  Also place the DMG file in the game folder. Extract the DMG file as well so that mounts on your desktop. Mount the No-CD crack in Toast.
Start the game. Seems to work."

,vradigar,2008-01-17T23:09Z,"hello, I've got a problem - how can I unpack the ,,Rise of Nations Installer?"" I can't mount it with a Toast 6...thanks a lot"
,Silent_G20,2008-01-18T02:02Z,"Stoneand>>> u've got to know that in macs, mounted images never have free spaces on them, so they r all CD-ROMs or DVD-ROMs. So when u wanna run any mounted application u must copy the image contents (or run installer if there any) to ur applications folder. 

Then u must have Toast version 6 at least for the crack to be mounted correctly. Open ur Toast's application (mine is ver.8.x) and select the dmg crack file, then mount. Right after that launch the game.

vradigar>>> forget about that installer ur talking about, since its just a dummy for the game to think this is the ""real"" game CD-ROM. Dont bother with contents of the crack, just mount it with Toast ver. 6~.

Now lets get to MY OWN problem! is this thing running on intel macs or not?! it keeps saying: ""map name or any object in game"" construction mask is invalid! when it starts to load right after the intros. Any help wud be much apprecited :)"

,arcadio72,2008-02-04T22:56Z,"Sorry but i need step by step instructions. I have been trying for days.
I copied the files into a new folder in applications. First I tried just the files from the folder named game then I tried all the files.
I right clicked the no cd crack file dmg and mounted it with Toast8. Then I tried burning it with toast 8.
Every time I clicked the game icon it told me to insert CD.

,gilgili,2008-02-07T01:02Z,"hey ppl
here is a step by step guide

A)If u already tried to install it, delete every file you created-copied (except from the 1gb file you downloaded...) etc, unmount everything and restart.
1) create a folder in your applications called ""Rise of Nations""
2) open the Rise of Nations.dmg
3) copy ALL the files included in the .dmg, inside the ""Rise of Nations"" folder u created in step 1
4) go to the ""Rise of Nations"" folder u created in step 1 and then into subfolder ""Rise of Nations Gold 1.0.1 NoCD & Crack"".
5) move the file        Rise of Nations Gold NoCD.dmg         FROM the folder ""Rise of Nations Gold 1.0.1 NoCD & Crack"" TO the folder ""Rise of Nations"".
6) mount the file         Rise of Nations Gold NoCD.dmg         using Toast.
7) run the game
8) stop dling pr0n and seed the files u download
9) support quality

if u follow all the steps it should work...:)"
,gilgili,2008-02-07T21:51Z,i m on intel too..did u move the nocd crack to the original folder and then mount it?
,gilgili,2008-02-07T22:23Z,"because in the beginning the crack wouldnt work for me too, and it only worked when i put the no cd crack in the RON dir,here is a screenshot of how yr RON dir should be (concerning files):

,Qusting,2008-02-17T12:39Z,"Thanks for the great help gilgili.

I have another problem though:

,pichualvarez,2008-02-25T23:57Z,do you HAVE to open the no cd .dmg with toast? cuz when I mount it with Mac's mounter it still asks for the cd...
,pichualvarez,2008-02-26T03:45Z,"yeah.. you HAVE to open it with toast... you may have some problems with toast 7, something about an error 192 that doesn't let you mount the file... you need to upgrade to 7.1.3, then it'll work..."

,Jimbo777,2008-02-28T14:50Z,"Hi All, sorry if this is a noob question, but how do No CD cracks work? I ask because I actually have a shop bought Rise of Nations installed on my hard drive but have lost the disc in a house move. Would I be able to just download this version over the top of it? Or would I be better off searching for a No CD crack on its own to get my installed copy up and running?

I mounted it just fine.. and the game file opened and everything, but when i double click the installer i just get

,melirin,2008-06-05T09:49Z,"Hi folks.

It's pretty simple actually. I got stuck like you guyz too. Prompts like insufficient disk space or pls insert disc or couldn't open game.pkg & etc...
I knocked my head when i finally got it to work.

1. Create folder in ""Applications"" and name it ""Rise of Naions""
2. Double click the downloaded Rise of Nations.dmg
3. copy ALL the files included in the .dmg, into the ""Rise of Nations"" folder u created in step 1
4. go to the ""Rise of Nations"" folder u created in step 1 and then into subfolder ""Rise of Nations Gold 1.0.1 NoCD & Crack"".
5. move the file Rise of Nations Gold NoCD.dmg FROM the folder ""Rise of Nations Gold 1.0.1 NoCD & Crack"" TO the folder ""Rise of Nations"".
6. Double click on the Rise of Nations Gold NoCD.dmg
7. You should now see a crescent-moon like shape mounted on your mac
8. DO NOT CLICK on the ""Rise of Nations Gold Installer"" (this will cause the couldn't open blah blah .pkg error)
9. Go back to your ""Rise of Nations"" folder & dble click on the ""Rise of Nations Gold"" application icon.

The game should start by now. In case there is no response from the game, pls wait... It'll take close to a minute before an entry box appears to prompt for your desired username to start the game. I thought it hanged the first time too but i waited while at the main game screen.
Good luck!!"
,melirin,2008-06-05T09:54Z,"By the way, I'm using Mac OSX Tiger ver 10.4.
I believe the uploader have informed that it won't work under Leopard, so don't bother trying.
Not sure about the later version of PPC..."
,VileCore,2008-06-11T23:28Z,Awesome. 
,Groovyshmoo,2008-06-22T14:12Z,"hey i figured it out for Leopard (by pure luck and screwing around)

just do as Melirin says, but also you have to have the RoN Gold Installer file from the NoCD dmg in the RoN folder as well.

In any case it works for me :D
"
,Azriel6290,2008-06-23T14:28Z,"Does this torrent actually contain the full game and expansion? I only ask as the file size is much smaller then I would've expected (Civ IV and AoE III were both 2+Gb for just the original game).

Am also downloading this for Leopard so will try combining the melirin and Groovyshmoo's methods."
,goltrin,2008-06-24T17:25Z,"Hi !
I do everything exactly what melirin said, but it doesn't run, it still asks for original CD-ROM. I just don't mount Rise of Nations Gold NoCD.dmg with toast... What happen ? Plizzzz Help me !
Sorry for the faults but I'm french, so...
"
,Azriel6290,2008-06-25T03:54Z,"I think that is your problem, in order for this to work I am pretty sure that you need to use Toast (though I could be wrong as I have limited experience with cracks)."
,Azriel6290,2008-06-25T23:29Z,"I am having serious problems trying to patch this game. I am running Leopard and have tried combining melirin and Groovyshmoo's advice however when I open up the NoCD crack and move the installer file into the Rise of Nations folder, it still asks for the CD. When I attempt to mount it with Toast 6, it says it cannot do it because ""Mount with Toast 6"" cannot be modified.

Any suggestions?"
,goltrin,2008-06-27T10:23Z,"Hi !

,mohammadmurtaza,2008-07-03T23:57Z,"Hey everyone, I figured it out. All you need to do is once you have moved the ""rise of nation nocd crack etc..."" you have to delete the folder from which is came from and then all you do is follow that faget merlin's suggestions and it'll work beautifully. Merlin is a fraud he copied what gilgili said initially on the first page. check it out."

,ModernLuddite,2008-10-03T04:48Z,"Getting nowhere but frustrated;
-I'm running Tiger on a G5
-I've followed the gilgill/melirin versions
-I've tried deleting the subfolder after moving the RoN Gold NoCD.dmg to the RoN folder (per Mohammadmurtaza)
-I've tried renaming the RoN Nocd.dmg to just RoN NoCD (per wisdomsdoor)
-A Black Crescent appears on the desktop naturally, or I can mount another with Toast 9, but neither has any effect.

There's an icon for RoN in the RoN folder and in the Game folder (inside the RoN folder). Opening either still asks for original disc.

Anyone got ideas? Did I miss something? Help appreciated."
,bigbadbug,2008-11-05T12:18Z,"Tip for the NoCD error - make sure the original dmg you install from is ejected before trying to run the game.

I've read all the comments multiple times combining them with eachother. but still it has no effect. every time I start RoN, it keeps giving me the nocd error. I think I've done something wrong in the process, but can't figure out what. for the record:
- I've created a RoN folder in Applications
- I've copied the files of RoN.dmg to the RoN folder I created in Applications. 
- I've dragged the RoN nocd from the nocd folder to the RoN folder I created in Applications
-I've mounted with toast
-I've tried the black crescent moon thing offcourse, even in combination with toast.
-and I've tried some deleting and renaming and multiple toast extensions, but no results.

all this has no effect. So if anyone out there can help me with this (screenschots etc.), it would be very, very, very appreciated."

Again detailed: 1. Create folder in ""Applications"" and name it ""Rise of Naions""
2. Double click the downloaded Rise of Nations.dmg
3. copy ALL the files included in the .dmg, into the ""Rise of Nations"" folder u created in step 1
4. go to the ""Rise of Nations"" folder u created in step 1 and then into subfolder ""Rise of Nations Gold 1.0.1 NoCD & Crack"".
5. move the file Rise of Nations Gold NoCD.dmg FROM the folder ""Rise of Nations Gold 1.0.1 NoCD & Crack"" TO the folder ""Rise of Nations"".

!!!Here you have to push all the open images out.!!!

6. Mount Rise of Nations Gold NOCD.dmg with !!toast!!.

7. You should now see a crescent-moon like shape mounted on your mac
8. DO NOT CLICK on the ""Rise of Nations Gold Installer"" (this will cause the couldn't open blah blah .pkg error)
9. Go back to your ""Rise of Nations"" folder & click on the ""Rise of Nations Gold"" application icon."

5. move the file Rise of Nations Gold NoCD.dmg FROM the folder ""Rise of Nations Gold 1.0.1 NoCD & Crack"" TO the folder ""Rise of Nations"".

!Now you close/delete/push out all open disk images. This is important! I tried it the first time without and got disk error like many of u guys.

6. DON'T double click on the Rise of Nations Gold NoCD.dmg. Mount it with toast. (u can also change the suffix (the "".dmg"") to "".toast"" and then double click. (if u have toast installed)
7. You should now see a crescent-moon like shape mounted on your mac

 the game freezes after the scenario is done loading about 75% of the time. it won't let me quit using keyboard shortcuts so i have to shut down my computer every time it happens...is anyone else having this problem?

>> yes, I am having the same problem (completely freezes) after playing for 20-30 minutes ...   I don't think that this game likes Leopard 10.5 very much. "

,Zwein,2010-10-28T18:06Z,"This torrent won't started downloading, why?"

,felfner,2011-02-08T00:03Z,"I have MAC OS X 10.6.6, and whenever i try to load an actual battle or quick match, it stops loading and freezes. I can still move the mouse.

Everything else works fine, is their a solution? will continue seeding for MY FAVORITE GAME EVER (:

Thanks a bunch in before hand, ps: I you have a problem don't just write ""this doesn't work, why?"" give out some information!"
,getsumtrolls,2011-03-09T04:41Z,"Ok here is what you have to do, i was having trouble with this forever. 

1. Open the .dmg file you got from the download.

2. Make a Folder in your applications named ""Rise of Nations""

3. Copy all the files you get from the .dmg file to the folder ""Rise of Nations"" in your applications.

4. Next, what i did was opened Toast 9 Titanium, which you can download for free here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4098134/TOAST_TITANIUM_9....

5. When you have Toast 9 Titanium open, there will be a picture of a cd, and a green arrow pointing to another cd, click on that. Then you will be on a page, and to the left there will be three options stating: 'Disc Copy' , 'Image File' , and 'Disk Image Merge'. Click 'Disk Image Merge' and you will get the option of either selecting and ISO image or a mac image. Click select mac image, and then go to your ""Rise of Nations"" folder in you applications. Next find the .dmg that says: Rise of Nations Gold NoCD.dmg Click on it and click choose. Finally click the button next to select mac image, that says ""Mount"". 

6. This moon shaped thing that says ""Rise of Nations Gold"" will pop up on your desktop (i dont know what they call it for mac).

7. DO NOT CLICK it! If you do, you will have to start all over again!

8. Just leave it there, and go back to your applications, and click on your ""Rise of Nations"" folder, open it, and click the app that says ""Rise of Nations Gold"" and open it. 

9. Rise of Nations should open up fine, and you can play the game! Good luck! I hope I helped!!! 
Have Fun!"
,ljdooley,2011-03-31T19:23Z,"Just for the hell of it, all of you morons having the problems, im going to guess that you DO NOT HAVE an Intel based Mac?

Amirite?"
,Sambonimachine,2011-04-13T09:17Z,"Finally. I did it, as exasperating as that was. You definitely need Toast, Disk Utility doesn't work I don't think. 

Instead of just mounting nocd.dmg, go to save as disk image and save to the desktop. 

Rename it simply Rise of Nations Gold. Double click it. 

It won't work yet, but the no cd message should appear slightly different. Instead will say ""Put in original disk"" or something. Throw Rise of Nations away (the new disk image), and mount with toast. Don't open it! Just try the game again.

Should work, at least it did for me. I'm running Tiger 10.4.11. Takes a minute to load once opening movie is over, just be patient. That only took a day and a half, fuck.

ps. suck it ljdooley, I don't have Intel."

,Lol4Speed,2011-05-15T01:35Z,"I GOT IT THIS IS HOW I DID IT WITH INTEL BASED MAC AND TOAST TITANIUM 11 OMG!!!!!!!
1. After you make a folder named rise of nations and copied all the files mount the no-cd in toast.
2. after its mounted DONT DOUBLE CLICK THE MOUNTED IMAGE (it's a moon)
3. After it's mounted EJECT the original with all the original files.
4. After you eject it open up rise of nations from the folder that you copied everything from in your applications folder.
5. Play ***tell me if there is a problem.***"

,rusty-koathanger,2012-06-29T04:52Z,"the seeding action for this torrent is odd; nothing for ages, then boom! hang in and be patient (like i did) and it will eventually happen. i got stuck at 93% for months and eventually got pissed off and trashed the file. re-downloaded with no progress for a couple weeks, then one day i got it in 2 hours. I'm seeding (slowly) to someone and will continue for a long time"
