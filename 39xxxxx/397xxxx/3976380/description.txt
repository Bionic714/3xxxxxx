*** Plot Synopsis by Jason Buchanan 
Gridiron Gang star The Rock picks up the pigskin once again for this sports-themed family comedy concerning a football superstar who abandons the gridiron to answer the call of fatherhood after learning that he has a daughter he never knew. Kyra Sedgwick stars as the professional athlete's ruthless agent who would rather see her client scoring touchdowns than cementing familial bonds, and Nichole Millard teams with Kathryn Price to pen the screenplay.
