Forgot to put:
This is the story of guys who take Churchills ""Blood Sweat and Tears"" speech to heart and speak with actions, not words.

""We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France,
we shall fight on the seas and oceans,
we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be,
we shall fight on the beaches,
we shall fight on the landing grounds,
we shall fight in the fields and in the streets,
we shall fight in the hills;
we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.""

Respect to UK and US Intelligence ;)"

,Schwarzenbart,2008-01-15T22:09Z,"Look Alma, unless you are going to post and seed torrents yourself, which you do not, and unless you are going by the date from the DVD, not good ol' IMDB, you will stop posting with uncreative criticism.

Like I asked in the other torrent, do you want me to repost it?"

,Lizzie7,2008-12-17T17:18Z,"I was delighted to find this film here - thank you! 
If someone out there could help teach me how to find and use subtitles for it, Swedish or English, I'd be able to share it with my aged and almost deaf Mum. Anyone?"
,Schwarzenbart,2010-05-14T07:51Z,"Seeding again, the subtitles were encoded with divx converter, so you need the divx brand player for them to work..."

Nice movie to watch...."
,Schwarzenbart,2011-03-27T00:14Z,"Hey guy,
I believe there are subs encoded into the video, but I ripped it along time ago, with the divx converter, so you ned divx player or vlc to see them maybe?"
