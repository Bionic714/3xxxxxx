,danieljackson,2008-06-25T00:54Z,So is this video in English if so why the subs?
,danieljackson,2008-06-25T00:56Z,Also will this burn and play on my dvd system seeing as it came from a pal source but i'm in the U.S so the ntsc is the format here?
[T],kirklestat,2008-06-25T11:56Z,i think it can work. my country uses the NTSC format but even using the PAL movie on my DvDPlayer it still work.
,punkfreak73,2008-07-09T06:40Z,thanks a lot very good movie
,zerolain,2008-07-13T11:54Z,"worked a treat...ty
also, to danieljackson ...the eng subtitles bit refers to a couple of scenes where a subtitle comes up letting you know ""where"" you are (like what they do in the x-files episodes) eg. ""Lunar Base, 20:00 hours"" that sorta crap.
there are no dialogue subtitles running through the film if that's what you were thinking :)"
,hernyo05,2008-09-15T19:02Z,why is the sound so terrible???
,tony_star,2010-04-03T22:34Z,Thanks...
,Simoneer,2010-05-03T02:57Z,"@danieljackson: Well, speaking for myself, I prefer  having subtitles for multiple reasons, even if I do know the language. To mention one of these, I am Swedish, and while I understand English pretty well, I have a bit of trouble HEARING some of the words properly. In those cases, having the option to read as opposed to having to listen carefully is so very appreciated."
,BulletMz,2010-06-05T08:22Z,can any one please tell me the sequence of the movies??
