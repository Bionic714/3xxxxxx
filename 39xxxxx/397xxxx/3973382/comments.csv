,LenusHimself^^,2008-05-21T17:44Z,"Is this the real NHL 2008 or is it just a stupid copy of 2007 with some different stickers on the arenawalls and the same music?
I'm tired of that shit..."
,SenileReptile,2008-06-02T14:54Z,"This is what to do:
Open the img-file with Daemon Tools > Mount it > the NHL 08 autorun menu will pop up > chose 'install' > use the cdkey from the .txt file > after installation is complete explore the mounted img-file with daemon tools > copy the file from the Fairlight folder > paste it in the folder where installed  the game (for example D:/EA Sports/NHL 08) replacing the old ""nhl2008""-file"
,SenileReptile,2008-06-04T01:47Z,"Hmm...think something's wrong with this torrent.
I've started the game on just about 10 occasions now, and it's already got stuck on the first match and caused my computer to freeze up 5 times.
Sucks ass. Uninstalling... (Wasn't such a good game anyway, very stale and repetetive) "
,cybertrollet,2008-09-20T00:57Z,"Works great.

Remember to explorer the fairlight folder, copy the 7mb exe file into your ea folder. (overwrite) 

Play on

THEN COPY AND REPLACE
THE hhl2008.EXE IN GAME (MAIN DIR) 

WITH THE nhl2008.EXE IN MAIN DIR. FROM FAIRLIGHT DIR.

REBOOT AND RUN THE GAME !"
,ddcarson,2010-03-03T19:22Z,works for me just fine on windows 7 but i don't think it's nhl 08. something earlier perhaps but not 08 because i can't find any of the things I KNOW nhl 08 has. not really even worth downloading if you ask me..
,r1mpi,2010-05-12T15:59Z,"i dont know what im doing wrong, i tried to copy and replace the crack, but it won't appear to the folder ! what i'm doing wrong?"
