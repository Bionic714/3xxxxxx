,psycopuppy,2008-10-11T07:53Z,sigh...what r u ppl using to play/decode this? I have tried everything and nothing works. do I need a special kind of hardware or something?
,bbbreak,2008-11-11T15:21Z,"Here's what you do if you want to watch any good but low size video:
Go to google.
Search K Lite Codec Pack and get the full installation.
Install.
Then google VLC Media Player.
Install.
Make sure files open with vlc...and you're welcome."
,sliptrip007,2008-11-30T22:05Z,dudes...don't answer the questions when these people ask how to open shit. They are moles looking for answers to what software we are using these days so they can invent some code to stop it. Douches......

,DeadAIready,2010-01-01T10:07Z,"I know alot of people are asking about how to play these files. I used to see these files and totally avoid the torrent. 
so i downloaded the K Lite Codec Pack thing and the VLC player
Is there a way i can convert these files to avi or mpeg?
if not, i dont really understand how to play all those files at once can someone please help?"
,Bunnieanubis,2010-01-03T13:31Z,"well here we go the first thing you need i belive is winrar easy just search for it. the other thing is codecs these are the thing that decode video and audio. a good one to get is divx that what i use

,Crisimare,2010-03-07T14:27Z,"First of all im not a fucking pervert asshole im a loyal pirate that watchs porno in my spare time inbtween work and play when im in a dry spell.

secondaly holy shit slip trip how the fuck did you know that they are people who try to stop piracy and they are here??

ARE THERE REALLY ANTI PIRATES??"
,Bugsy_B,2010-05-09T17:53Z,"I AM a pervert and I update my repertoire of porn daily! ;D

LoL Crisimare...sliptrip sounds like someone trying to build their own conspiracy theory.
Regardless...there are some truly STUPID people on here.
Case in point...I'm not going to mention names but it was explained how to open said video file and then, a mere 2 comments later, someone asks how to open the video file.
Another head-scratcher is people asking how to open a spanned RaR file. What is it about online porn that always seems to attract all the newbs? Someone hasn't heard of WinRar? I'm not a geek or nothing but it occurs to me that if you are delving into the world of torrents, you should know about (and have) the full arsenal of compression tools and know how to use them before you start downloading anything. You should also be versed in the fine art of program unlocking tools such as keygens and activators.

Here's a little wit of wisdom for you wannageeks...
Don't go getting yourself a new player every time your default won't play something...you would be well served to keep your number of video players to a minimum and just get the proper codec for your player of choice. No need to cram more software onto your HD, taking up more space."
