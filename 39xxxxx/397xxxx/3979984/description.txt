Angus Wallace (www.anguswallace.com) is an independent musician living in Edinburgh. This is his first album, and its a pretty good one.

You can tell he likes lots of different music - this album makes me think of Jeff Buckley, Dylan, Radiohead, John Butler Trio, Led Zeppelin, Tori Amos, Mike Paton and Joni Mitchell. This is a gutsy nu-folk/experimental/alternative/blues album with an edge.

This guy is not very well known, and this is clearly a low-budget recording, but that just adds to the charm. A nice mix of songs.

Enjoy!
