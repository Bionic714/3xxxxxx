,FulciLives,2008-01-21T09:47Z,"PS3 cannot properly play back an AVI file that is over 2GB in file size. It will play it back but stop when it reaches 2GB.

This is what I read nd I can confirm this with your RESIDENT EVIL 3 release. It was also about 2.15GB and sure enough it stopped right towards the end ... had to finish watching it on my computer.

I tried streaming it over my network as well as playing from a DVD-R as well as playing it from the PS3 HDD.

Does not work.

This is the 80GB PS3 with firmware 2.10

Please keep up the great work BUT make the files 2GB in file size and if they need to be bigger then split with no single file larger than 2GB and please try to be same and do not go over (keep it like 1.99GB etc.)
