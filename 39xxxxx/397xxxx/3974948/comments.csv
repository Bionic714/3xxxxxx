Even though you aren't getting many comments (or ""thank you""s) there are quite a few people downloading so they are definitely enjoying them.

Thank you from me (and my wife) and please keep uploading them.

,Harry Q Hammer,2008-01-19T02:34Z,"Hey flixer,

Would you mind jumping back on episodes 104 and 107 of 77 Sunset Strip to get them seeded? They are both stuck on 99% or so and there are about 10 peers on each. I am keeping all the ""77"" torrents alive so if you were to do this much appreciated favour, I could keep ALL the ""77"" torrents alive for a long time to come.

Sincerely,

HQH."
