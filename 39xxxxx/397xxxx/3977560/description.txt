Hansel and Gretel came to life in 1954 as never before, in this kinemin* animated feature set to Englebert Humperdinck's classic 1893 opera. Sung by some of the most acclaimed performers of the day, this score was nominated for a Grammy Award.

With brilliant imagination and unprecedented technical wizardry-comparable only to Walt Disney's Fantasia-this production uses 35 hand-sculpted dolls and lavish sets to create a fantasy land of unearthly beauty, inhabited by characters of unparalleled charm.

*The kinemen characters took over 15 years to develop. Compounded of intricate armatures a secret chemical mixture for "flesh", human hair, magnetized feet and truly human personalities; they are "exemplary actors", able to duplicate natural movements of the human body, and with a variety of facial expressions that surpass the range of humans. 

**The lines present at the very bottom are present in the DVD format also.**
