,mystc411,2008-01-11T21:11Z,"Do you need an image of the disc then, because it is asking me to insert the CD now?  If not do you have any other suggestions?"
,mystc411,2008-01-11T22:24Z,Nevermind my above comment.  Is there a download anyone can recommend that works well for Mac?  Any links would be appreciated.

The above download works fine for Mac. The ISO contains both the PC and Mac version.

But mystc411, did you find an answer to your question? Why did you say ""nevermind"". Maybe you could try telling us whether you figured your own question out - that would be of great help :)"
