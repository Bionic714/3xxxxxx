This is my very first torrent,  so if I screwed something up, just let me know. I created this from an audible download and then I used goldwave to convert the files to mp3. Then I used  an mp3 crop program to get rid of that annoying   \\\"This is Audible\\\" thing at the beginning of each part.  I kept them in 5 large files because that is how I like to listen to them.  If you like a bunch of smaller files, use an mp3 splitter once you have the files downloaded.  I will send for as long as I can.
