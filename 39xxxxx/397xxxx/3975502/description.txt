These are the available lexicons for Funkitron Scrabble, any version (including Gameloft Scrabble Deluxe). As far as I am aware, these are the latest files available as of January the 14th, 2008.

Simply select the lexicon you wish to use and copy it to the MavenOSPD3 folder, which you can find in the game's install folder.

Rename the original "Lexicon.daw" to "Lexicon.daw.ORIGINAL" (note that this is the same as the included Lexicon.daw.OSPD3), then rename your chosen lexicon to "Lexicon.daw".

I am not a scrabble expert. I compiled this archive as a result of getting annoyed by the fact that funkitron Scrabble kept ignoring completely valid words and using words that baffled me and my dictionaries.

That's why I am not providing any means to contact me.
