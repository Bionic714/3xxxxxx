By its apparent abdication of its duty under the Constitution and refusal to hear our landmark Right to Petition lawsuit, the U.S. Supreme Court has ushered into existence a dangerous state of affairs that can not, and must not, be tolerated by Free People.  

By its denial of Certiorari in this most important case, the Court has sent a silent, but unambiguous decree to the People that cannot be left unchallenged: that the People have lost their Fundamental Right to peacefully hold the Government of their creation accountable to the Constitution and the rule of law.

Please begin to spread word of this Constitutional travesty across the land.

Our Constitution is, indeed, hanging by a thread. We pray the Supreme Court will reconsider this grievous decision that denies to the People a declaration of the full contours of the meaning of the last ten words of the First Amendment.

During the coming days, this Foundation will announce what it believes are the appropriate next steps for the People to restore Constitutional Order and secure Freedom for ourselves, and our posterity.
