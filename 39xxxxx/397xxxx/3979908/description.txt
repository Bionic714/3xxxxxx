There's a story going round that Blur had so much trouble agreeing on the line-up of this album that eventually the record company lost patience and left it up to public research groups. Which is, of course, just how it should be. After all, in the recent past, Blur have not exactly kept shtoom about the fact that they don't want these songs any more. In fact, they even paid them the ultimate insult by bashing them out, with no feeling whatsoever, in chronological order at the awful A-sides tour last year; a gesture which disrespected their fans by sulkily giving in to what the plebs wanted so that the band need never do it again. Their loss. These songs are ours now and they're brilliant. Well, most of them.


The ones we like best - the big pop anthems, the soundtrack to our very own twin summers of love - are monuments to the power of pop. The ones the band still like - the sulky, moody, half-baked, experimental ones - are a bit lame. Oh well. At the very least, this magnificent collection reminds us that, at their peak, Blur were a band who had the balls to be significant, to mean something other than just doing it for the music, ma-a-a-n. This was a band with an agenda: to nail the state of the nation and to make a difference. Can you believe the audacity of this? To matter. And in the deepest throes of his love/hate relationship with this rotten little xenophobic island of ours, Damon Albarn created some of the proudest pop songs of his or any other era. That's pop, by the way, as in popular.
