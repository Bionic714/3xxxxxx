In 1984 Duran Duran undertook the hugely ambitious "Arena" tour. Apart from a fleeting appearance at 1985`s "Live Aid" concert, this series of shows was the last time the original line up of the band performed together until their successful reunion in 2003. They took film director Russell Mulcahy along for the ride, and he executed the footage in style by producing the concert film ARENA. SING BLUE SILVER is designed as a complimentary release to ARENA, and includes previously unseen footage that failed to make the final cut of the film. An intriguing look at one of the hottest bands of the `80s, this release offers a behind the scenes glimpse at the band who, for many, provided the soundtrack of the decade.
