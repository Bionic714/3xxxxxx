I just hate when someone makes a torrent and puts it on a tracker that requires registration. I have not fully downloaded this file yet to check if it really is the first episode of Ghost Hunters International. But I have a good feeling.

This is an untested torrent that was seeded on a register only tracker, I say, put it here and share with everyone.

Ghost Hunters International Episode 1.
