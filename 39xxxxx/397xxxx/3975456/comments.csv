,Deliverium,2008-01-13T21:43Z,"Good, a bit unsure about ""But a whimper"", might be missing one or two songs. Report if its missing something, and ill get up a new release for ""But a whimper"""
,TorrentMonster,2009-03-22T01:59Z,HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPOSE TO LISTEN TO IT!?!?!?!?!?
,iPodAddict181,2009-05-17T03:27Z,"@TorrentMonster, you can use UnRAR to open this.

@OP, don't put music in RARs, put the albums into folders and just upload it like that. Otherwise, good torrent."
,zarcain,2009-05-22T05:37Z,"""MPEG-4 audio file format""
so... no artist info, no song info, no track number, no cd.

you DO know that there are bands that make an album as a WHOLE, right? That you should listen from start to finish, right?

so why do you have to be different? why not use a normal format so people can, I don't know, listen to the albums the way they're supposed to be played?"
,superlucky,2009-06-18T08:34Z,"Jesus, zarcain, it's in Apple Lossless format with all the tag info included.  You can play them in iTunes and on your iPod.  If you don't use iTunes, then simply convert it to whatever you choose.  Deliverium was cool enough to upload this music for us, and you want to bitch about it despite the fact that you don't know what you're talking about!!

This is a good torrent.  If you don't know how to open a rar file or listen to an m4a, then you are in the wrong place.  Go buy a cd.


Thanks for the upload, Deliverium."
,superlucky,2009-06-18T08:38Z,"BTW, I noticed that zarcain - who bitches about the nice people who upload stuff here - has not bothered to upload anything him or herself.  What a douchebag."
