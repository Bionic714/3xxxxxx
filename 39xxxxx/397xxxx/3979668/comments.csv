,nick2tornado,2008-01-26T00:14Z,wen u leave comments on other torrents then atleast use english..this msg is to all non eng users of TPB.
[T],Knaster,2008-01-26T03:16Z,"nick2tornado lol are you for real? This Site began as an swedish/scandinavian site now arabian and american ppl inhabit the place(which sucks assssss). well this is an scandinavian torrent  and if it had been an interesting thing for you ppl that rides camels or drive lamborghinis i would have made an english description which is not needed since you wouldnt want this unless you're scandinavian.....If you were, then you should be able to understand swedish.......Since you dont  well bugger off!!!!
