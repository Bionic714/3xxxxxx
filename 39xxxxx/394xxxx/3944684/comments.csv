I don't know if there's something wrong with this file or if it won't run on Mac.  It's in a Windows > Applications category."

any help? 

tried mounting the iso file and burning it. it mounts and burns to a disc but there is no data there..."
,wurdipus,2008-11-01T20:05Z,Got it. seems burning to CD is still fubar....mounted with PowerISO...it just took like 2 mins to finally mount and show the data in the ISO image.
