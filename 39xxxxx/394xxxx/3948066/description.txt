             The Decline and Fall of the American Empire

Empires come  and go. The United  States with ruinous  wars, a bloated
Pentagon budget  and an economy  that spews red  ink may have  a short
imperial shelf life.  Recall the words of President  Eisenhower in his
1961 Farewell  Address. He  warned of the  "conjunction of  an immense
military  establishment  and  a  large  arms  industry....  The  total
influence, economic, political, even spiritual, is felt in every city,
every State  house, every office of the  Federal government....we must
not fail to comprehend its grave implications....we must guard against
the acquisition of unwarranted  influence, whether sought or unsought,
by the  military industrial complex. The potential  for the disastrous
rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.

Johan Galtung of Norway is a leading advocate of non-violent solutions

global  network for  conflict  resolution. Among  his  many books  are
Choose Peace  and Peace by  Peaceful Means.  He  is the winner  of the
