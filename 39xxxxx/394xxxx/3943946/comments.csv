It polutes a digital collection of files with analogue crap.
If it wasn't widely available OK, but both 7'' & 12'' versions are easy to find, all digital."
,g8aso,2007-12-23T13:58Z,Just uploaded it in proper 100% all digital flac lossless if anyone wants a decent non-analogue copy
[T],splattergod,2007-12-24T18:38Z,"Thanks for this one...
Some of us still appreciate the fullness of analog..
I, for one, love vinyl rips...
Keep up the good work!

,opoder,2010-11-23T21:15Z,"Everyone who knows about audio know that vinyl has a frequency range (bass) better than CD. And lossless = no cut frequency (like mp3 or ugly wma).
I love a REAL RIP (taken from original media).
I will download and check.
Man, thank you for this torrent. "
