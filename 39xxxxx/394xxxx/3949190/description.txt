_____________________________________________________________________________________

Dedicated to Japan's rackgaki (graffiti) scene, this book illustrates the work of major graffiti artists working in Japan today. It showcases the creativity that lies within this new and relatively unexplored form of contemporary Japanese art. Interviews with the artists, and the authors' own experiences in documenting the different aspects of this subculture, reveal an art-form at the cutting edge and often at odds with police and civic authorities. An accompanying DVD brings to life the imagery of the book and includes footage of graffiti being created. Set to a soundtrack by some of Japan's leading Trip-Hop artists, the viewer is fully immersed in the subculture that is Japanese graffiti.
