You (or whoever encoded it) has used a low motion codec so every time there is movement on the screen it jumps. have tried it on numerous players and even on my standalone divx/dvd player but the result is the same, sorry to say this but dont download people! Thanks again for taking the time to put it out there but at least check the quality first!"
