Cuts removed/added/extended: 
All profanities are gone. it's not that I hate profanity, it just seem like bad writing. 
Trim the awkward scenes. 
The sex scene is gone. See above 
Bill Paxton's character humor is gone. 
Maria Conchita Alonso... mostly gone. 
Morton Downey Jr.'s gone. 
Many more trims to remember. 


Conceptual improvements/advancements of edit over original: Jeez, where to begin. I was very dissappointed by the sequel. 
It had none of the (hehe) gravitas of the original. There was a lot of shouting and cursing. 
Poor Danny Glover was saddle with a role that I don't believe he enjoyed. So I clean all that stuff up so now it's shinny and new.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++ABOUT FANEDITS+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A fan edit is a version of a film modified by a viewer, that removes, reorders, or adds material in order to create a new interpretation of the film. This includes the removal of scenes or dialog, replacement of audio and/or visual elements, and adding material from sources such as deleted scenes or even other films.

Now remember: THE ORIGINAL IS STILL THERE... INTACT!
A fanedit doesn't replace  the original. It's like creating a playlist or making a cd from different tracks. It's just an alternative ride. A remix.
If you liked the original: MOVE ON.
If you want to see an alternative version: DL.
Fan edits cannot be bought or sold, the material is copyrighted and belongs to the original owners. To legally watch them, you need to own the original DVDs. 
Enjoy.
