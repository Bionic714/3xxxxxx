Zoe, a 12 year old classically trained singer, decided to use her gift and embarked on a mission and following the release of her first two CDs has raised over Â£120,000 for various charities connected to her sister Jodie who was born with Downs Syndrome and sadly died during heart surgery March 2005.

When her new album Once Upon A Time was completed and ready to release, Zoe had mixed emotions as this had been produced as her debut album into the music world and not to raise money for charity.

A very concerned Zoe asked her parents, who funded the project, if this could be changed as Zoe wanted to continue her quest by using her talent to help others. Wanting to keep a connection with her sister Jodie, Zoe suggested helping family friend Rosa Monckton to raise both awareness and much needed funds for the charity Downside Up, which she is patron of. Downside up provide vital support to children with Downs Syndrome in Russia.

Zoe approached Rosa with the idea of offering the track Tears in Heaven as a download to the public with all the proceeds going directly to Downside Up. Tears in Heaven was the perfect choice as Zoe recorded the Eric Clapton classic as a dedication to Jodie. Rosa was delighted with Zoes generous gesture.

Tears in Heaven, along with a bonus track of She moved Through The Fair taken from Zoes first album Little Ray of Light which is no longer available can be downloaded from 12th November 2007.

Please help ZoÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â« gives hope and much needed support to the Downs children of Russia, who deserve to live a decent dignified life!
