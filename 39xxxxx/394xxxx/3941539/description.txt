Picasso, painting in front of a camera.  He uses specially designed transparent canvasses, to give you an unobstructed view of the great artist at work.  A unique insight.

Great as a resource for Teachers of secondary KS3/KS4/KS5 Art and Design.

Clean, Good Quality. Burned with Nero 8.1 without problem.

Enjoy!!
