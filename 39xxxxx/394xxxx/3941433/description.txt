Additional comments: 
DVD-Video containing the second concert of Mark Knopfler 
and Emmylou Harris in Copenhagen, taken from the "All 
the roadrunning world tour 2006". Picture and sound quality 
is fairly good. Most of the concert is filmed far away 
from the stage. So no real close-ups but a nice overal 
view. During "If this is goodbye", the filmer is walking 
downstairs to get closer to the stage. From that point on, 
the picture quality is a lot better. Very nice version 
of "Donkey Town", a song that was only played at the very 
start of the tour. Also great to see "All that matters" in the setlist. 
Complete concert. Available on two DVD+R's.
