There are over 700 roms in this collection, apparently all US releases (This means no Japanese roms, translated or otherwise).  Thanks for making this great collection! :)"

,lonerks1,2008-03-12T19:03Z,"Just downloaded and extracted (manually)
Upon extracting, 2 errors occured..
So 2 of the games in this entire package might not work, but no other errors indicated. 

Nice work."
