,TK50,2008-01-30T08:28Z,Thanks and appreciate the upload. This almost completes my cartoon character and vehicle DT series. I just have an issue. I have extracted the contents of the 2.03gb of data and only turned out to be CD2. I was curious if CD1 is in the archive as well. Please let me know. thanks
,TK50,2008-01-30T08:50Z,"I found it!!, sorry disregard my earlier comment. I just wasn't looking..also had a long day. Anyways, again thanks for the upload!"
