Sorry, but compatibility is a nuissance! ;)

Also, audio quality is 128 kbps.

Enjoy the movie!"

,VeganFreak,2007-12-21T10:16Z,"ganjamaan - have you seen Mac Danzig in the UFC? He's vegan, definitely not weak. All nutrients have vegan sources, so don't think you have some advantage eating animals when the nutrients the animal is composed of all derive from plant products at some point (therefore animals don't posess nutrients unattainable on a vegan diet, to think otherwise is illogical. Not to mention vegans have lower rates of cancer, obesity, osteoporosis, and nearly ever other shit-ass condition i can think of.

People are living in a culture of ignorance. Open up to veganism!"
,wordofdoom,2008-05-18T01:47Z,"Fuck you vegan pieces of shit.....way to take a step backward in the evolutionary progress of man. The fact is that if humans had not started eating meat we would still be a bunch shit flinging monkeys swinging around in the jungle......Jeez man, read a fucking science textbook at least once in your worthless life."
,VeganFreak,2008-05-28T00:41Z,"wordofdoom: First of all, most vegans today started out as meat eaters, having experience on both sides, while meat eaters in general only have experienced their own views, usually without even caring to research veganism at all (too much work, eh?). So we both know that most meat eaters are not conscious about their food habits, it is rather a social phenomenon to be so ignorant about the plight of animals, the environment, and the cost to human health. Vegans are highly conscious of food while meat eaters tend not to be, as such vegans evolve intellectually, which is the only good way to evolve. Since you mentioned evolution, you might be surprised that early humans were food gatherers rather than hunters, and the reason humans have evolved the way we have is because our brains evolved that way, it has nothing to do with meat or this culture of ignorance. It is rather unfortunate that not all of us are using our brains efficiently or making conscious decisions about things that directly impact our life and all that is around us. Go study human physiology and figure out why a vegan diet isn't so necessarily counter-synergistic.

Secondly, you're not very convincing when you insult and curse at people you don't even understand (obviously). So I recommend you cool your jets and do some research, before you embarrass yourself further."
