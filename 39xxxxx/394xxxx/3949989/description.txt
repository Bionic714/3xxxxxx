Volume 2: On The Dark Side
Program Three: Cosmic Alchemy - In the beginning, the universe started as a single point. Yet from this tiny beginning came all the matter that we can see around us today. How could pure energy become matter. Over the past century a series of discoveries have shed light on our understanding of matter.
Program Four: On The Dark Side - When we gaze up at the night-time sky, we see the shining stars in the blackness of space. But is the space empty? In the 1950s a young American scientist discovered that the stars in rotating spiral galaxies seem to be held together by an unseen force. Vera Rubin proposed the idea that the space between the stars was filled by invisible stuff she called dark matter. Scientists now believe that dark matter could make up an unbelievable 99% of the universe.
