[T],PARiSHiLTONCLUb,2008-03-28T18:47Z,"tackar, du skulle kallat den Dexter.S02.720p.HDTV.X264-CTU för alla releaser är CTU. Men skitsamma fortfarande ett bra jobb, istället för att tanka alla osorterade."
,Hei_på-deg,2008-03-30T00:03Z,"PARiSHiLTONCLUb:
Mulig jeg heller burde kalt den det.
Men så søker også mange etter ""season 2"" når de vil ha den komplette sesongen. Ikke sikkert ""S02"" ville kommet opp når folk søker etter sesongen."
,rmiller3one,2008-04-02T21:31Z,"is anyone having trouble with the audio with the files?  the first episode works fine, but in the rest, the background noise seems to be louder than the dialog.  how do i fix this?"
,Hei_på-deg,2008-04-03T23:14Z,"rmiller3one:
Are you using VLC? www.videolan.org

Also, check your audio-drivers."
,Bananahammockz,2008-04-19T11:44Z,Utrolig bra pakke - ble ferdig på 4 dager. Takk! ;D
,loveeternal,2008-05-02T08:17Z,Bah so many Seeders and yet avarage download rate is around 25kb´s -.- Seed? Uploading 10 times faster then downloading.. 
,mindistortion,2008-06-05T20:55Z,"hello
i know a lot of people will tell me to go to hell but i just wanted to know if this torrent was in english or some other language?? thank you"
,Hei_på-deg,2008-06-08T17:48Z,"It's in english.

But you can find subs for many languages on the web."
,sconnoll,2008-06-19T00:43Z,"I think there might be a problem with:
Dexter.S02E05.720p.HDTV.X264-CTU

Maybe it's just me, no one else has complained and this has been up here for a while"
,Hei_på-deg,2008-07-01T04:29Z,"sconnoll:
Just rewatched the episode and didn't find any problems at all. 
I used K-Lite with WMP."
,Smuggles,2008-07-12T18:55Z,Thank you! Great show :) Will seed a long time

,Hei_på-deg,2008-08-14T17:44Z,Takker.
,satandole666,2008-08-15T07:24Z,"I've got the first 4 episodes done and I plan to seed for a while.  Question though, what codec pack do I need to install to play these in vista media center?"
,Hei_på-deg,2008-08-15T19:44Z,"satandole666:
I recommend K-Lite Codec Pack:
http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_lite_codec_pack.htm

or use VLC Media Player:
www.videolan.org"
,jonnetuominen,2008-08-16T22:51Z,"ahh the 720p maybe the best quality...
ahh the 1080p the best for now its kinda shitty that tv shows dont come on 1080p or even 1080i
but to the point:
thank you :D
and for all who read this use those drugs, PG, and travel to Finland ;)
CHEERS HEJ_PÅ-DEG"
,TheObbie,2008-08-18T01:17Z,"Woo! Varies from 280days to 1day left!! haha!

Does anyone know if Season One is available in 720p??"
,konkie,2008-08-24T15:29Z,"Having problem with watching. Have downloaded the first three episodes, the other ones still downloading. And either of the episodes who are at 100% works except the audio. When i play them it lags and shit.  Does anyone knows what the problem is?  I use VLC media player. "
,Hei_på-deg,2008-08-25T17:38Z,Are you sure you're using the lastest VLC?
,jackanada,2008-08-26T19:57Z,"I'm going to give this a go and if it works, and if it's as good as season 1 - then you all rock.
thanks"
,konkie,2008-08-27T15:52Z,How do i check if i have the latest one ?
,Hei_på-deg,2008-08-27T17:43Z,just download it from www.videolan.org
,konkie,2008-08-28T19:28Z,"Thank you REALLY much man!
;)"
,Hei_på-deg,2008-08-29T17:00Z,No problem. Enjoy the season :)
,konkie,2008-09-02T16:23Z,"Hello again ""Hej på dig"".  Your tip worked, until now.. I'm at episode 8 and the problem have come back, the exact same problem. And i can't watch the episodes i just recently watched either..
I've tried t reinstall the VLC-update but it does'nt work.  I'll appreciate help once again friend."
,Hei_på-deg,2008-09-03T09:23Z,"hmm, that doesn't make sense. try the k-lite pack:
http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_lite_codec_pack.htm"
,konkie,2008-09-08T13:29Z,"I feel like a baby when i come back to you for moore help..  Once again, the problem was solved. BUT after i've watched ain episode one day, and try to look at another a day after the problem comes back..  The difference now is that i can watch the episodes on the media-player i downloaded andi windows-mp.  But it lags as hell and the picture comes after the sound..

Please help me once again, if you can't i don't blame you. You have helped me too much already  ;)"
,Averyy,2008-09-10T23:32Z,"if the video and audio both play fine but not at the same time it means your computer is lagging.
whats ur comp specs, it might not be powerful enough to play HD content.

Stop using VLC, use Media Player Classic with the codecs installed (VLC uses its own codecs and doesn't use the codecs installed on the computer, thats why its so newb-friendly but sucks for 720p/1080p)."
,konkie,2008-09-13T12:46Z,"The prblem isn't that my cmputer can't play HD content.  Because i've watched 7 episodes without problem and other series with HD..

The thing is that this lag comes and goes, sometimes i can see an episode completely without problem and sometimes I just can't.."
,hartpn2,2008-10-06T09:09Z,"Thanks for this, i'll be seeding for a long time :)"
,storm-83,2008-10-15T19:57Z,"looks nice :o)

@ Konkie:
try uninstalling everything you have that has to do with playing media files and install:
   Coreavc
   FFdshow
   and download mpc 6.4 something (latest)
this combo will let you play hd flawlessly since it will use the smallest amount of processing power compared to other solutions. if this doesn't work then i will almost guarentee it's a hardware problem"
,Hei_på-deg,2008-10-15T20:57Z,"It may also be a virus/spyware problem. I know of people who've had problem playing high-def content because their computer was infected. the problem would come and go.
install a proper antivirus program, update it, and run a scan."

,dioxholster,2008-11-20T22:45Z,"STARGATE ATLANTIS MARATHON! needs to be recorded!

""It?s going to be ?all Atlantis, all the time? for the SCI FI Channel, which will bid farewell to one of its longest-running, signature shows on Friday, January 9. The cable network will run all-day marathons every day of the week leading up to the final episode, according to SciFi.com.

The first marathon is scheduled for Friday, January 2 from 8 a.m. through 3 a.m., with the exception of two hours set aside for Sanctuary (10 p.m. and 12 a.m.). This includes the first new episode to follow the holiday break, when ?Vegas? is expected to make its U.S. debut at 9 p.m. (8 Central).

Four 11-hour marathons will air the following week, from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

On Friday, January 9, a 13-hour Atlantis marathon leads up to the premiere of the final episode of the television series, ?Enemy At the Gate,? at 9 p.m. (8 Central). Another two episodes will air at 1 a.m. and 2 a.m.""
