as far as the wait times if you have a premium account it can be much quicker than a torrent"
[T],stevekasian,2007-12-29T20:20Z,"... But what TRUE PIRATE is willing to PAY for a premium account? C'mon, buddy - this is The PIRATE BAY. We're Pirates!! Arrrr!"
,zeroklk,2007-12-29T23:01Z,HAHAHA But you don't have to pay for premium membership and just so u know real pirates say yar not arrr ;)
,xbloodravenx,2007-12-31T19:50Z,"What is a .uif file, and what do i need to open it?"
,zeroklk,2007-12-31T20:23Z,"Universal Image Format(UIF) is a powerful compression image file format for backuping CD/DVD.  It is fast, reliable, and has rich set of features which include password-protected, data encryption, MD5 checksum support and much more.  UIF can not only contain the complete data  of CD/DVD just like ISO image,  But UIF  also supports backuping multi-session CD/DVD, Audio-CD, VCD, SVCD and DVD-Video.

,nibl69,2007-12-31T22:32Z,"Has anyone sucessfully downloaded this yet?  Another poster on here said to NEVER download UIF files as they contain trojans that become active once uncompressed.

Anyone verify this is a good file?"
,zeroklk,2008-01-01T18:20Z,thats such bullshit quit talkin out of your ass kid
,nibl69,2008-01-01T19:04Z,"First of all, zero, I'm not a kid.  I'm 32 years old.  Grow up.

Secondly, I'm not the one stating that UIF files contain viruses.  I've read it on MANY different torrets, posted by other people.  So if you want to call it bullshit, say it to them, not me.  

I was simply asking the question.  The last thing I want or need is a trojan virus locking up my fucking computer, so lose the attitude, you little punk.  It seems I would be better off looking elsewhere, as you seem to somewhat of an asswipe.

Now, I'll ask it again...Has anyone successfully downloaded and installed this with no problems?  "

,DeadGlory,2008-01-02T00:43Z,"Ive downloaded it and i get these errors when i open it with Magic ISO, MAIN FILE VERSION, PRODUCT REGISTRY PARENT, PRODUCT REGISTRY KEY, System Error. Code: 5. Access is denied."
,xbloodravenx,2008-01-02T04:07Z,"If someone would tell me how to use magic.iso to open a .uif I would be glad to see if this works on my end...

,RedMatrix,2008-01-05T06:10Z,"I successfully d/l and installed with no errors.  Install MagicISO if you don't have it already, and then shut it down.  Right-click on the .UIF and select ""Open with..."" and select MagicISO and check the ""always"" option.  (This is just in case it doesn't register the extentions)  Then you're golden."
,RedMatrix,2008-01-05T06:11Z,"Oh yeah, and I ran the KeyGen when the App asked for a product key.  Very easy & breezy."
,bellhs,2008-01-06T23:34Z,"RedMatrix did you have to run the keygen for each individual app, or is it a one time deal during the initial installation?"
,JesperNielsen,2008-01-07T15:12Z,"Ey everybody!

This program/torrent really works. Installed and running without any problems!

- Just install MagicISO, open the .uif file, take all the files from the .uif file and copy them to a another location on your computer.

- Run the installation-file and when it asks for the serial, run the KeyGen from the folder ""KG"" and enter the serial code. Finish installation.

- After the installation, run one of the installed programs. It asks you to activate the program.
Just say ""Next"" and ""Activate Now"", and then it ends up with a ""Activation Unsuccesful"".
Then you have to click on the ""Phone Activation"".
From that page, you take the 'authorized ..something..' (I've forgot it!) and put it in to the key-generator.
Then you click the key-generator to make the 'authorized code ..something..' (Damn!), which you put in to the empty field on the activation page.

- Then you're done :-)


All works perfect!

Thanks a lot, zeroklk!"
,davinci2000,2008-01-08T00:18Z,Does this version have On Location? Thanks!
,hairyfriend,2008-01-09T09:45Z,"First of all, thanks zeroklk for this major release.
But i can't get it to work. Downloaded with RS links. Extracted with MagicIso, burned ISO to dvd. Then selected the programs i needed, Indesign, Illustrator and Photoshop. Used serial from KG directory, Installing took 60min on a DualCore.. Then progress stops at 98% (Installing Master Collection file?) Then had to cancel with taskmanager. (Cancel in CS3 doesn't work) When checking install dir, Indesign&Illustrator is installed, Photoshop dir is empty. Thanks."
,zeroklk,2008-01-09T20:04Z,Did u try just mounting it in a virtual drive? either that or extracting the uif to ur drive.  It is a long install I think an hour half is about average.

This is the first time I've done this and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.  I would appreciate any assistance you'd be willing to share.

I downloaded using uTorrent
I extracted the rar files using BitZipper
I created a Virtual DVD using MagicDisc

When I went back to look at the uTorrent file logger, I see:
