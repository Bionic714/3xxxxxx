Robbie Williams - Nobody Someday (DVD) 7/15 [MQT]


Nobody Someday captures the highs and lows of Britain's biggest pop-star over the course of his 2001 European tour. We witness Robbie's relationship with those people closest to him, and see how he battles with his relationships with the press, his fans and his own personal demons, as he works his way through 15 European cities in 4 weeks.

Award-winning director Brian Hill was offered unprecendented access to Robbie over the tour, and the balance of live action against the observational footage and the honest, frank discussions with Robbie, result in a film that is refreshingly honest, frequently funny and often very touching.
