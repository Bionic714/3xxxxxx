After the apocalypse no one is safe ? even at the North Pole. After tragedy strikes, Santa withdraws from life and turns his back on Christmas. When he finally emerges from seclusion, the old world is gone forever and as Santa struggles to find his way in a post-apocalyptic world, can he find a way to save Christmas too? This true story of the last Christmas is action-packed, funny and sad. It stars Santa, the Elves, a good boy, lots of naughty marauders and of course, Gary the Snowman.
