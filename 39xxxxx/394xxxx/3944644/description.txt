The EverQuest 2 bot has changed name to EverHunt and was just released in its 5th beta version today. Beta tests have been running and most bugs and problems are storted.

The to do-list from Project blogg #3 is almost complete. The class support is the only part not finished yet and i've added a few more things to the list of development:
# Avoid grouped and/or elite NPCs.
# Log off (and shut down computer) when a certain level is reached or suspicious players are following you.
# Saved waypoint profiles.
# Return to huntingpath if character dies.
# Loot chests/corpses.
# Log window.
# Full class support.

I'll be prioritising the autoloot function followed by the class support. The bot has been tested on Windows 2000, XP and Vista without any compability problems.
