I want to thank those that have downloaded my torrents and helped me learn, and allowed me to share. Enjoy"
,yellow_snow,2007-12-26T19:13Z,"Thankyou for sharing this wonderful series - I've been trying to get it from various sources (individual files and packs), but they either were not seeded or were bad copies.  Your's are great.

These will stay on my seeding list for a fair few months I think :) (Only finished s1 & s2 so far though)

Thanks again."
,Ozintaos,2007-12-26T21:43Z,Thank you for your comment Yellow snow. I collected this set from newsgroups awhile ago and I am crazy about the series. I am glad to have had the learning experience & the oportunity to share. Thank you for putting up with slow initial upload and I too will make sure this set never lacks seed :)
,Lucifur665,2007-12-26T22:14Z,Thanks for this brilliant series. just finished watching series 4. Shame it was never on dutch television.
,khessels,2007-12-29T13:24Z,"Thanks for putting them on line, i love these series, i'll keep seeding them as wel. cheers, K."
,iconoclastx,2007-12-29T16:52Z,"Thanks very much Ozintaos - I decided to go looking for the Andromeda seasons just a couple of weeks ago after watching a bunch of reruns and being annoyed at how out of order they were. :)  I'm still crunching away at S2-4 (I got S1 from a member site I'm a part of, but the person never uploaded the other seasons), and just now started S5.  Thanks for putting them up, and for committing to seeding. :)  I will make sure I seed as well."
,Ozintaos,2007-12-30T16:21Z,"My ISP is upset with my usage lately so Seeding may be a bit slower, but I will finish getting this out if I have to switch to dialup to do it :) Doesn't everyone transfer .5 TerraBytes of data a day? How is that excessive use? Lol"
,iconoclastx,2008-01-01T18:39Z,"yah, ISPs can be such whiners... :)"
,Rabbi_DEJK,2008-01-03T04:29Z,"Im stuck around 36% and no seeds for the last couple of days, but over 50 leechers still....could someone continue the seed please? Thanks very much"
,Ozintaos,2008-01-03T19:22Z,"Rabbi_DEJK and anyone else complaining about seeding. I ran 2 computers on 2 networks seeding this series nonstop for a month getting the first 4 seasons up. My ISP has threatened to cancel service unless I reduce volume. Therefore, rather than running as I have I am seeding a couple hours in the morning and a couple in the evening. The series will finish, and I will maintain my connection. If that is not fast enough I sugest you buy the DVD"
,yellow_snow,2008-01-03T19:55Z,"Ozintaos, you are doing a Brilliant job.  Don't worry about those who complain about the speed, just as long as we can get to have at least one other seeder at some time :)

My seeding of the first 3 series is still ongoing - although my connection is pretty poor as well, but I will not stop it for a long while.

Thanks again."
,iconoclastx,2008-01-04T20:29Z,The good thing about the intermittent seeding is that pretty much everyone who is downloading will finish at the same time... :)
,iconoclastx,2008-01-07T14:28Z,"Ozintaos - can you verify that 519, 521, and 522 are alright?  The file sizes are quite small compared to the rest of the episodes...

Also, would you be interested in snail-mailing a DVD so 1) I could get S5 now and 2) I could help seed?"
,aussiedavid,2008-01-12T13:44Z,"I salute you, Ozintaos. For your service to humanity, Sci-Fi and the old Commonwealth!

Hurrah!"
,quadinaros,2008-01-16T01:03Z,"hm, suppose we need an actual seed now..."
,Ozintaos,2008-01-19T16:34Z,ISP issue resolved...Full seeding till done. Thanks for your patience guys
,dhawalraj17,2008-01-19T21:15Z,Please seed some one 
,iconoclastx,2008-01-21T14:05Z,"Lots of seeders now - thanks Ozintaos.

And for anyone who was concerned about my comment above regarding the small file size of episodes 519, 521, and 522 - I just checked them and they seem fine.  They're a slightly different format, it seems, but still played fine in Windows Media Player (have to test later to make sure it works on XBMC)"
,Ozintaos,2008-01-21T15:53Z,"I meant to report that I had checked those eps Icon, but yes all are good and glad to finally have it up."
,Rabbi_DEJK,2008-01-24T11:47Z,"Sorry I didnt understand the torrent was new. Thank You Ozintaos for the torrent and Im seeding to a ratio above 4.0 and sorry for the bitching again and also one last time....
Thanks and I seed because Im an American and there is nothing more pirate then a filthy yank!."
,yellow_snow,2008-01-27T21:38Z,"I too have now got all 5 seasons - thanks again, Oz. Will seed as long as possible :)

[Halfway through watching s5 now - good series!]"
,Rabbi_DEJK,2008-01-31T11:15Z,"Seriously thanks again man, and Im seeding like a nympho with no condom"
,calibra_nox,2008-04-15T19:48Z,"Thank you SO MUCH for these 5 seasons! I just loved this serie as a little boy, and I will seed them a good while after I've got all seasons on my computer!"
