,jollikolli,2008-01-12T11:42Z,Havent you ever heard that the code used on keygens is mostly the same which is used to get the virus&trojans smaller. Can somebody please say to those noobs that I'm right.
,darkerdrake,2008-05-14T00:17Z,can u get hold of a AVG keygens plz
,bombertonforty,2008-06-11T00:48Z,"Yeah, I've found from experience that a lot of keygens that scan as ""Dirty"" with a/v programs but can be used OK

But I got a spare rig that I test them on, so I ain't got to be so nervous as some people"
,yadayadaya,2008-06-17T03:35Z,Stop using worthless free virus software like AVG.  It's positive virus finds are about as reliable as using the pull out method for birth control...
