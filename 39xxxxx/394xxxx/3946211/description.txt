This highly detailed series recreated the adventures of Conan Doyle's Victorian detective in painstaking detail, sometimes to the extent of recreating the illustrations which accompanied the original story publication in "Strand" magazine during the late 19th century. Thirteen of the Holmes short stories were adapted in this series, which was followed by two sequels ("Return" and "Casebook") as well as several TV movie adaptations.
