,chilehead,2008-04-08T01:11Z,"Hey funnygut1234 -

Doubt there are any subs for you in this rip which is from the series shown on BBC. So probably straight British English."

,doktorfarfardjuret,2008-11-25T08:40Z,THIS IS THE BEST AND GREATEST ! JEREMY BRETT IS SHERLOCK HOLMES. ;BLESSINGS TO THE MAN ETERNALY !
,zeinabqureshi,2008-12-14T21:46Z,"One of the most precious torrents out there. Believe me, this is one of the best torrents out there, and this Holmes series is certainly the standard against which all others will be measured. In the final season. Jeremy Brett (James Huggins) was so ill he was struggling to stay up on his feet, his voice trembles...but what a rendition! You've got to see this.

Many thanks to the original uploader...I got this two years ago, by the way...one of my first torrent downloads, and this has been, to date, my biggest download...when I downloaded it there were like six or seven seeders if I were lucky...but now tpb also has grown, and this torrent has so many seeders and leechers...

Lol"
,cubedmeatproduct,2008-12-23T04:59Z,"excellent, thank you very kindly for this, quality is very good, it's been many years since i've seen this series"
,nisakiman,2008-12-29T19:33Z,"Oh joy! There are seeds online! Jeremy Brett was without a doubt THE best Sherlock Holmes EVER. Thank you ralphparot for uploading this series - it's going to take me an age to download at 1 Mbps, but it will be worth it!"
,troyanac,2009-02-25T00:23Z,"great collection, but poor video quality..."
,JebusKryst,2009-06-02T19:35Z,"Troyanac,
I've got the proper DVD's of this and the quality isnt much better - cost me a quite a bit too. I do hope Granada clean up the print and re-release it - although the grainy picture does give it a authentic ""old England"" look...

Brett was a genius. Its a shame he never recorded the complete works for audio - that would have been fucking awsome."
,liam1989,2009-07-12T18:35Z,Cheers for this torrent.

For the newer fans of SH, guys please read the book as well. Its simply ecstatic & a page turner.

If you wanna gift the young generation, gift them with the likes of
(Books)
*Sherlock Holmes
*The Hobbit
*The Lord of the Rings

rather than the magnanimously vapid Harry Potter & its ilk.

Sherlock Holmes rules. Thanks for this gem!"

,duranachief,2012-07-11T18:58Z,this is piss poor quality. I downloaded the whole thing and then discovered. dont waste your time. there is a far better torrent for collectors in mkv format. size around 36 gb.
