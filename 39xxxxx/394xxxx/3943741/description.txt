- removed the TV interview (over the top)
- added serum scene from Blade2 to make a bridge to Whistler delivering the newspaper
- moved serum inhaler scene into Whistlerâ??s daughter fighting the vampires scene
- removed Dr. Vanceâ??s evaluation talk to Blade (this made no sense since he is a familiar and Blade may be in his own world, but he watches the news on TV, so he will know both the current date and who is the president)
- removed the fight for authority between the chief of police and the FBI agents (unnecessary)

- removed several HK scenes during the escape.

- removed some more of the shooting sequences during the escape (it is unbelievable enough that they escape from a police headquarter)

- removed the group name â??Night Stalkersâ?? (very embarrassing)
- removed HK from saying he had been a vampire (please no)

- removed lame jokes form HK torture scene

- removed â??gimme 5â?³ when the vampire kicked HK (lame)

CBB Overview

Conceptual improvements/advancements of edit over original:
The original movie was a major disappointment, because of being undediced between a comicbook movie, a parody, a comedy and a horror-action movie. Also the movie was obviously created for teenagers and tried too hard to be â??hipâ??, which it never was.
We deleted 50% of spoken text, 99% lame jokes and cut out 22 minutes, which will not be missed. With about 50 cuts we tried to make this a true horror action movie and a worthy finish of the Blade series. We recreated a lot of sound and score elements to alter the overall atmosphere.

Time needed for the edition:
planning: 3 months
editing: 3 weeks
sound editing: 1 week
art design: 5 days
trailer: 2 days

 

persons involved: 5
