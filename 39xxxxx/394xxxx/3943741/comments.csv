,Warcloud,2008-08-09T23:43Z,"I support your work 100%
the studio/director absolutely ruined this franchise. ANY editing would drastically improve this"
,r1r22,2009-06-19T22:02Z,"er, no, sorry warcloud, while i agree with you 100% that this was a complete load of crap compared to the first 2 movies, the director for this last installment is actually the writer of the whole series, both 1 and 2, which makes him the creator of the series in the first place, so you cant really say he ruined this franchise when he was the one who created it

then again, george lucas..... : /"

Most of them make the movies in their lists much, much better....Thanks for the upload, just wish that there were more seeders so it won't take forever..."
