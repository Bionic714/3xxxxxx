,neolectric,2011-05-01T17:01Z,holy smokes what a torrent! 
,CarlosSpicyweiner,2011-05-12T00:17Z,there had better be a reason why there are only 3 parts to noble house instead of the 4 that are listed on IMDB....unless it was condensed into 3....lol
,CarlosSpicyweiner,2011-05-12T02:12Z,"also...where is the 4th tape/disc of Noble House???...apparently the 4th part is the climax and ending to the whole damned thing..without it...the other 3 are completely useless...thanks ralphparot...lolol. 

next time, make sure you have all of the parts to a particular show...try not to leave people hanging wthout the ending ! ! ! !....lol"
,Bitchley,2011-05-25T09:52Z,"@CarlosSpicyweiner check the files before commenting! The Noble House files are, in fact, complete. I believe it is a transfer of the 3 VHS tapes that were available before the DVDs came out. So the quality of that one isn't perfect, but at least it is complete. It's an excellent miniseries, btw!

In short, a fabulous torrent!  Thanks ralphparot. "
