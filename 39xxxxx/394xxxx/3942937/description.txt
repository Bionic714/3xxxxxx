Becket is best enjoyed as an excuse to just sit back and bask in the rich nuances of textured English dialogue as two giants of the stage are given a couple of hours to shame all contemporary "actors" by effortlessly handling ensemble scenes with nary a "rapid-cut" edit in sight. Both O'Toole and Burton were nominated for the Oscar that year. Plot? What's it about? Bah! Who cares. Kings 'n bishops 'n stuff.

Do not miss the Peter O'Toole commentary track.

This rip extracts a 2.33:1 image letterboxed to a 16x9 anamorphic canvas, and crops the black bar padding.
