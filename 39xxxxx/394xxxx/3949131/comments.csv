,mindprint,2008-01-06T19:25Z,Great! Thanks for sharing
,mindprint,2008-01-06T20:20Z,Somehow the soundlevel is pretty low. is this a straight CDrip? Or maybe the orgiginal is that low? Seems strange. Thanks anyway
,friktioner,2008-01-08T11:30Z,"if the volume level is low, that means this is the advanced leak that came out around august. anyone found a new retail rip yet?"
