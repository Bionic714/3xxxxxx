,alisteramadeus,2007-12-28T22:41Z,are u looking for a accounting software or for taxes? 
,Compinator,2007-12-29T04:35Z,"Accounting to run it, for ex. a inventory of items, list and membership of clients, etc. "
,boomtastic,2007-12-29T14:42Z,This is not the Windows version. It's for MAC OS.
,Earl_the_Pearl,2008-01-02T22:38Z,What the heck is Mac crap doing on the interweb?
,MItch Cumstein,2008-01-05T18:41Z,"It may work on both, but it I know for sure it works with Windows cause I'm using it now!"
,ricksickle,2008-01-06T16:19Z,"Mounted ISO with alcohol, installed, running flawlessly on my windows PC, great job!"
,Fygar,2008-01-09T17:49Z,"From what I can tell, this is MAC only, the file types are for mac.  What are you running Vista?  Because my XP will not run it."
,Fygar,2008-01-09T19:01Z,"Ok, so I am a spaz..... Once I mounted it and extracted it then burned a copy of those files, it worked perfectly!!  Thanks"
,blabberhole,2008-01-10T06:22Z,"can you download the update, or should you stay offline with it?  

It works offline just fine with Vista.
Thanks"
,dirks,2008-01-22T02:16Z,"Much easier to use than some of the previous comments lead you to believe.  I'm using a PC with XP; no hint of a MAC here.  After the download I used Power ISO to mount the image to a virtual drive; clicked the drive and program installed without a hitch; no extracting; no burning to disk.  I let it phone home for the update without a hitch.

WARNING - there were 13 updates I got that were dated 1/16/08 so if you updated before that date, I suggest you update again before you do your taxes."
,gomer1000,2008-01-29T01:10Z,"There is no issue and this file works perfect. I downloaded then mounted ISO with Alcohol 120% on the virtual CD. Installed and updated. Then downloaded state. All with no issue.

Windows Vista 64"
,tiffany22,2008-01-29T17:56Z,Thanks uploader. Works great. I extracted with Power ISO and ran the setup exe.
,pure3d2,2008-01-31T08:17Z,"All of the TurboTax versions are PC and MAC on the same CD.  They do not make separate versions.  Stop making dumb comments before investigating, dumbasses."
,wittyusername,2008-02-03T17:14Z,"Works great; mounted ISO in Alcohol & also burned to disc with Nero8; both methods worked flawlessly.  

Updates also downloaded w/o issue."
,highwaysong,2008-02-04T22:56Z,anyone know where I can find a patch or a something that will allow me to download more than one state?
,Skidpalace,2008-03-12T06:12Z,"Not sure what the fuss is about.  Downloads an ISO that is easily read/extracted with WINRar.
Burn contents of folder to CD and done.
Installed on Win XP without a hitch.  
Updater installed 14 updates the last of which is dated 3/10/08.  Don't skip the updates."
,zorkenberry,2008-03-17T18:50Z,"Agree with skidpalace: downloaded iso file, was able to mount with daemon tools and open the iso in winrar.  No bullshit passwords needed.  No specific software needed.  No virus/trojan detected via F-Prot scan."
,ZEBEDEEGODDESS,2008-04-15T01:37Z,"Can anyone please help me with this?
I downloaded the iso, used alcohol to burn it to a disc. but no matter how I try to access setup.exe it always say setup.exe has encountered an error and  had to shut down. I dont even make it to a load screen. The log file is all code so I cant tell what is going wrong in the setup file.  I must be doing something wrong.
HELP? PLEASE?"
,adwo,2008-04-16T01:46Z,"Thank you V. M. for your effort.
I do not like ask for to much, but any idea for extra free State. Need Three States, Can't afford it, I dont have enough ""Washington's"".
Thank you for now.
adwo"
,peterd13,2008-04-19T22:00Z,"Multiple State Instructions:

All you need to do is delete the following registry key for Intuit from here (make sure TurboTax is closed):

HKEY_USERS\HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-281999088-2041747401-2946972498-1006\Software\Intuit\TurboTax Deluxe 2007\Pref

(The registry # (S-1-5-21-######) will not be exactly like the one above, but similar - navigate a little bit and you'll find the pref file to delete - works perfectly)"

U R THE Man!"
,kimberwinkle,2008-12-05T23:34Z,"I know how stupid this sounds...but when you e-file, is there any way to tell if you've used a pirated copy? I figure it's okay to use a copy seeing as you all do...but I just had to ask. *paranoid*"
,falcon62,2011-04-14T08:24Z,3 years later and I need to amend my 2007 taxes.  I can't believe this is still available.  Thanks Pirate Bay!
