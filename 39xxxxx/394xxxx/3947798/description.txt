This is a VERY funny game, and don\'t even need to be installed. (But unrar it first.)
Put this exremly tiny file in a DIRECTORY wherever you like and doubleclick on it, and play. It will make a hiscore-file (1 kb) and that\'s all.

It is very small, and no install need. PERFECT simply. Run it whenever you got some spare time to kill. If you need a break, just press WINDOW-button.

From the beginning this was written to the Amiga computer by Marcell Byranyai, but Peter Liepa likes to play it on a PC, so he convert it, and that very good also. Thanks to both for a dam nice game.

Probably same as http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3384722/BoulderDash.exe but nobody seems to seed there anylonger.

I try upload this earlier, but it didn\'t work. I used this time WinRAR instead of an executable file, and try again now. Sorry, but not my fault.
