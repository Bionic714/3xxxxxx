Hi There...

I'm at the moment being constantly monitored and hindered in sharing Christian material. For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed "only" two..

The people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called "free Nation" of the western world..
And then I'm accused of being a "conspiracy-theorist".. :-)

Anyway: The late Reverend S.M. Lockridge once presented an incredible message, describing our God and who He is.
Though he says "He's Indescribable", he surely does his best to do so.  This is the high quality DivX version, suitable for presentation even on the bigger screen, made from the *.wmv file downloaded from some website. I don't remember which.

I have to ask of you Truth-Seekers; men and women, boys and girls, TO KEEP THESE TORRENTS ALIVE BE SEEDING THEM FURTHER! Or else they will die.. 

Just leave the files in your Download Folder, copy them onto other media, and please LEAVE THEM SEEDING! 

Thank you so much.
