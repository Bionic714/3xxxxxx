[T],verifire,2008-01-04T13:02Z,Stupid is who stupid does. Don't go blaming everybody for what the hipocrites pass off as Christianity. It's not Jesus' fault..

And to my fellow Christians I say: ""youruncledarnell"" has placed the same comments on oh, so many of my uploads. Please help me pray for him. He seems to be in a lot of pain."
