Review:

Richie Sambora's second solo album, Undiscovered Soul, is a more ambitious affair than Stranger in This Town, finding the guitarist trying on a wide variety of styles. Not all styles fit Sambora's bluesy hard rock foundation, but it's interesting to listen to him try out blues-rock, power ballads, pop/rock, arena rock, and Stonesy rock, even if he's not always successful. Sambora has a pleasantly bland voice and knows how to craft a hard rock song, even if he doesn't always come up with a good hook. The result is a respectable journeyman album filled with competent songwriting and fine guitar playing -- just the kind of record that will appeal to his fans.
