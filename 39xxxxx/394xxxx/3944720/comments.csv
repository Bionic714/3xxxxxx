Also  you need to have bitcomet to download this,  I have numerous files named ""_____padding_file_7_if you see this file, please update to BitComet 0.85 or above____"" This guy is a blight on the community and should be banned from this site"

,ffttss,2008-08-04T12:48Z,"Look guys and girls, torrent is fine, if you don't want to download bit comets padding files (and if you don't use it who would?) don't download them, i use utorrent and by holding shift and using the arrow keys you can select all padding files then hit spacebar. voila all padding files deselected. utorrent will now skip these files.

Not rocket science."
,Enigma1990ad,2008-08-10T15:47Z,"Hey dude the theme song for Sunset Beach is incomplete. Would it be possible for you to upload the entire thing or did you get it like that from the source?

,kandidat2005,2009-01-14T07:50Z,"Man this torrent really sucks. practically l the number were with errors, or only like 10% of the number was available. And the sec you start to listen to the mucis, the IP Spoof attacks begin. 

So if you like virus ect. and mp3 with errors, you should really download torrent. If you dont like the above, ban this idiot! :("
,hello_rabbit,2009-05-28T00:35Z,This. Is. AWESOME.
,micarone,2009-10-18T03:12Z,"kandidat2005 : Why are you bullshitting people and trying to make my name look bad? Are you fukken jealous or something.
If this torrent REALLY is so awful with full of errors and viruses why are YOU the very first one who complains about it. Everyone else has said thanks and not a single word about errors or viruses/trojans.
Go kick some nails under your toe nails and STFU!"
,strongbow99,2009-10-29T20:47Z,"Great soundtracks!
And what ""The Proffesionals"" from composer Laurie Johnson ???"
,bryanr12,2012-06-22T17:03Z,"You know, I can deal with junk files with the delete key.  Whom ever made the torrent was just trying his best to make a bit of money for his or herself.  Yes we do complain, but for the the great themes, junk files are like gnats flying around your ears."
