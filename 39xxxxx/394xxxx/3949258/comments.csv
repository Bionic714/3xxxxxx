I'll stick my neck out here and say that this is one of the ten best movies ever made.  It certainly is a strong contender for being one of Steve McQueen's best.

And, make no mistake about it, Steve McQueen is absolutely superb in this movie.  Supporting cast deliver flawless performances as well.

Gorgeous photography, intriguing plot, character development, grand (and terrible) historical events, action, suspense, adventure, romance, tragedy ...  This movie has it all.

My recommendation to all who read this:  grab it, watch it, and SEED!

Thanks again for a great upload.   M."
