,NeverEnuf80,2008-10-24T04:27Z,"That guy is a moron. I really appreciate the FLAC files. While he listens to Fallout Boy (or whatever posers listen to) on his knockoff iPod's headphones, I have tens of thousands in audio gear in my home and 5 figures in my car (with only 2 8"" subbass speakers that will absolutely massacre any of these kids speakers at any frequency with perfect clarity)...I spent all my $$ on gear and like to download my albums lossless when I can to get more out of the gear. Not quite actually ""lossless"" to the highly anal listener, but worlds better than 256kb mp3. Apple lossless is closer.

Point being, kiddies can get their MP3s. Don't listen to them. These are appreciated by people who truly care about the music, aren't broke obama voting proletarian communists that want more money without becoming a more valuable person, and have moved out of their mom's house so they have something worth listening to it on. :-D

Thanks much! Any FLACs are worth posting! (unless you have Apple Lossless ones)"
