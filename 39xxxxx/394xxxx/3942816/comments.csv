,vEcToR_2007,2007-12-21T19:43Z,Already in the database old chap!
,the-uploader-boy,2007-12-21T20:31Z,So? Maybe noone is seeding that one idiot!
,ltdnightcrawler,2007-12-21T20:54Z,thanks alot mate !!!!
,the-uploader-boy,2007-12-21T21:09Z,no prob :P
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-22T01:05Z,"Actually it is being seeded. And he is not an idiot, He is just ensuring the integrity of the pirate bay. Before uploading torrents all you have to do is search to make sure that there are no duplicates. Whats the point of uploading something that is already available and seeded? vEcToR_2007  is not an idiot. Everyone here should be as diligent. The less confusion while searching the better. "
,the-uploader-boy,2007-12-22T12:24Z,"4 people has already uploaded this thing, I actually uploaded this for my friend so he could download it..."
,the-uploader-boy,2007-12-22T12:27Z,"There are only around 3 seeders on the others, mine is fresh and now has 18 seeders. IsnÂ´t that much better? Get a life..."
,Skylink*Wien,2007-12-22T13:39Z,REQUEST XPAX FROM HIFI SIMULATION!IT'S BETTER THAN FSPASSENGERS!
,pvekz,2007-12-22T19:29Z,I have the serial of xpax by hifi simulation but need the setup file
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-22T19:44Z,"SO everyone should just upload torrents that already exist? Yeah that makes tons of sense. I believe if you go to any torrent site on the web it tells you to please search to make sure you are not uploading a duplicate. There is a reason for it. If people learned how to search for what they were looking for example TNCM FSX then it would be at the top of there search list. But dumb people like you and anyone else take the easiest way out by just uploading duplicates instead of learning how to use the system. So from here on out we might as well just download old files and re-up them as soon as they are done so we have ""fresh"" copies. If you learned how to search by anything other then the default criteria then you wouldn't have to worry about how ""fresh"" your torrent was. 
fag."
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-22T19:44Z,"how says ""fresh"" anyway...... Vanilla Ice? "
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-22T19:50Z,And I guess you are one of those people who do not know how to search. Because there are only 2 torrents for Fly Tampa TNCM for FSX that exist. The other 1 is for fs2004. Go fly a plane
,the-uploader-boy,2007-12-22T21:52Z,"I uploaded it for my friend because the 2 others was going SO FUCKING SLOW, and I have it and uploaded it so I could seed it for him... he downloaded it in around 1 min and then others started downloaded it so I kept on seeding it. If noone had start downloaded it I was going to delete this torrent. Fucking idiot"
,radar201,2007-12-22T23:56Z,I'm new and I would like to upload MegasceneryX las vegas but it's taking to damn long or it seems it's not workn been trying since this afternoon.
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-23T03:33Z,:-)
,the-uploader-boy,2007-12-23T12:57Z,"YouÂ´re really weird, do you know that?"
,Panodilo,2007-12-23T13:03Z,"It really makes me sour
when people are so dumb
Come ride my fleshy tower
I'll fill you up with cum

Santa Clause is senile
He brings the same old shit
Another TNCM on the pile
Let's throw a fucking fit

I'll grab Santa by his beard
and slap him with my beam
and just like the y'all had feared
Santa choked on my cream"
,the-uploader-boy,2007-12-23T14:34Z,"You are so fucking stupid, I uploaded it for a friend BECAUSE THE OTHERS WERE TAKING TOO LONG! And then OTHERS STARTED TO DOWNLOAD IT SO I KEPT ON SEEDING IT! It is just nice of me to still seed it... you are soo stupid."
,Panodilo,2007-12-23T14:41Z,"I was going to write some snide remark per usual, but I completely forgot about the torrent and its attendant displeasure when I envisioned my legacy splashed across Santa's rosy cheeks. I love you, Uploader, and I wish to bring you along on my next pilgrimage to Israel where I will baptize you at the Well of Jizzm."
,Panodilo,2007-12-23T14:52Z,"Reminder for tomorrow, cock fiends. Donald is on at three."
,vEcToR_2007,2007-12-25T09:50Z,"Just love being at the Pirate here.....what poetry is laid upon us here, especially by the hands of cum-jizzing Panodilo....YEAH! Awesome!"

,ElmosFriend,2010-02-08T21:07Z,"wtf this torrent is not right!  I got black squares on the runway and the ground terrain is blurred.

Are you sure this is not for 2004?"

,vkk68,2011-08-08T10:33Z,Has anyone tried applying v1.2 patch to this? will it mess up the installation?
