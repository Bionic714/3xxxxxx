The granddaddy of all LSD documentaries sounds even better today than when it was released. The attitude is mocking and hostile in an understated manner rather than openly confrontational, perhaps because it was made at such an early stage. Interviews with acid luminaries, regular heads and neutral observers are tied together with classy narration and musical fragments, and an unforgettable peak is reached with an actual trip recording of "Brian", a hipster acid head who unfortunately happens to have his first bad LSD experience while being recorded (with concealed microphones). The recording is authentic-sounding and either very funny or pretty scary, depending on how hard-core you are. 

Brilliant LP, and the artwork and photos are equally outstanding. As evident from the promo ad above, the LP was released as early as August 1966. Both stereo and mono copies exist; stereos have a"Full Dimensional Stereo" designation on the front cover. (lysergia.com)
