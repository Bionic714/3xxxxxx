24 hours of music from Chronix (Aggression) continuous from 12plus am 12-21-07 to 1plus am 12-22-07

Chronix (Aggression) is a mix of (hard rock) and (heavy metal) commercial free, they don\'t play mainstream music all day like the locals fm rock stations, they have good taste they don\'t play (emo) neither  

this wasn\'t recorded via the soundcard = record in (wave) with some noise then encode to (mp3) = shit

i use (Wm recorder) to download the stream, this mean that is exactly the same music they transmitted

the stream was splitted automatically by (Wm recorder) in 65 mb = 70 minutes of music approximately

the audio bitrate is mp3 128 kbps


this is great to listen in the car or in your ipod


i will try to upload one torrent like this every week
