IRIS Flight Simulation Software is proud to announce the release of the first IRIS Pro Series product range, the Raytheon Beechcraft T-6/A Texan II. 

The IRIS Pro Series T-6/A Texan II has been designed from the ground up based on the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Student Guide CNATRA P-872 & P873 (Rev 03-04). The two documents (approximately 400 pages each!) contain a wealth of information relating to the T-6/A Texan II, it's systems and operating procedures. 

From the word go, we knew we had something special planned for the Texan II and we strongly beleive that we have provided it. The Texan II product accurately resembles the real aircraft in looks and functionality and a great deal of the systems work accurately within the limitations of Microsoft's Flight Simulator Software. 

Our main crititsim in the past has been performance related and as such, we have paid special attention to frame rates over a variety of different systems. The FSX version of the T-6/A Texan II is our first 'Built for FSX' product which features, self-shadowing, normal mapping and reflective bloom. Furthermore, designing the FSX version using the FSX exporter has resulted in our ability to provide much higher levels of detail in the virtual cockpit than obtained in previous products. 

The avionics are taken straight from the pages of the systems guide and as such are faithful to the real aircraft and T-6 pilots have already commented on the visual accuracy of the instruments. 

Whilst certain elements remain in development, please rest assured that this T-6 is a continuing product and that a number of systems packs will be released in the coming months as our technical expertise increases and we are able to provide updated items that enhance your enjoyment of the product. Our aim is to provide an aircraft which is identical to the real T-6/A Texan II in performance, systems and looks. It won't be a quick process, but it WILL be a worthwhile one! 

I would like to take the opportunity to invite you all to viewing some of the items in our media center and on our support forums where the beta test team openly discuss issues relating to the development of the product. As always, we welcome public feedback, as it is integral to the success of this product.
