[T],josh.db,2007-12-26T17:55Z,"Notes:

If you find yourself capped at a certain download speed, that's because I work on a shared network and can't hog our house's bandwidth

If there's no seeds, more likely than not my computer is off or I've been nice to my housemates and stopped seeding so they can use the network, too.  Just wait around and/or shoot an email to torrents@joshdb.com"

,Mikeylee,2009-02-11T01:11Z,"If your downloading this album you should be ashamed of yourself. Seriously, look at yourself in the mirror and ask, ""Am I the kind of person that listens to horrible dribble produced by the same people who do Miley Cyrus's albums?"" If you answer yes, so be it...Just make with the suicide already. "
