Ed Hunter - The Iron Maiden Game

Ed Hunter was Iron Maiden's first computer game and was released on
the 17th of May 1999. It was produced in a deluxe 3 CD package. 
The 2CD double album features the soundtrack to the game itself whereas 
the third contains Iron Maiden's first computer game. 
The soundtrack was voted for by fans on the official Iron Maiden website.

Just as Iron Maiden were the first to release a promotional video, the first to have
released a full length concert video and one of the first to have released their entire
back catalogue of albums as enhanced CDs they are one of the first bands to have 
released a video game.

Ed Hunter is a shoot 'em up game in the style of Time Crisis and Virtua Cop 
where you use your PC mouse to control the shooting.
It has 8 levels ranging from the streets of London to the pyramids of Egypt and ┬┤
even into the future.
