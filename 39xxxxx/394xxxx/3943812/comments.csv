,Segac,2010-12-12T12:51Z,I found a program called ScummVM which emulates old computers. If anyone used it to play this game can you tell me which files to copy to a new folder so that ScummVM would open them?
,Benitinrocksahuevo,2012-01-07T03:16Z,"Allright heres what you have to do if you havent figured it out yet

Unrar it
then you will get two files the play disc and the install disc

first mount the install disc and run the set up
after that mount the play disc and play with the ed hunter app from where you install it......
make a shortcut to your desktop so you can play easier



cheers and enjoy this awesome game

UP THE IRONS!!!!!!

What OS are you running? and the wording is a bit confusing. I am running Win 7 and i get an Application not found error. I am not familiar with mounting Games so a walk through would be very helpful. (I am mounting with PowerIso BTW) "
