,Pyrusdk,2007-12-21T09:27Z,"Mr. X: rls falls OOS by 500ms at 46:49 and also nuked for IVTC. The release by PUKKA is fake and only PRE-spam. THS release also falls OOS at the same time. With popular releases like this, there will be a bunch of propers, screwups, and fake spam releases, etc. My advice is to keep checking back on RLSLOG until we can confirm a release that isn?t screwed up."
