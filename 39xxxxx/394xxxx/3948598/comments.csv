I should point out the irony in you making an insult regarding me sucking off an animal, when you suck cow milk from the udder (indirectly i suppose, as is the nature of those who choose intentional ignorance). Truths and facts can lead the human population to a state of much-needed intellectual evolution. Veganism assesses all the problems in society, as it is the single strongest choice one can make to abolish the unnecessary miseries of the world. Grow up."

,dude2030,2010-02-26T06:31Z,The movie is asolutely retarded. Only wasted my bandwidth... If you really want a healthy nutrition - go for fresh organic food and sea products. Being a vegan does not make ANY sense.
,flyingmist,2010-03-25T08:52Z,"great video.

Vegan is the way to go indeed.

Those who's devotion isn't there for veganism, they only ""fail"" and find themselves into false harmony in the future."

,kritias,2011-06-27T19:25Z,"""Veganism assesses all the problems in society"" uh huh... first off, calm down, Freak. Secondly, just take a look at that statement. Think about it for a minute. Do I really need to say it?

Secondly, changing your diet isn't ALL about the bad stuff you're putting in. Cheese won't kill you. It's about using and abusing other sentient beings for our own gain, and needlessly, since there are better diets that don't require killing and eating sentient beings or keeping them caged up at all.

Check these documentaries out, they're awesome
Free Food and Medicine
Food Matters
Fed Up - Food Behavior
The pH Miracle Diet
Cure Tooth Decay (Weston Price Conference)
The Beautiful Truth
Feed Your Head
Cancer - The Forbidden Cures

There's plenty more, like stuff on water fluoridation, etc. but I've got over 1000 documentaries so it's kinda hard to sort through em lol

Never stop looking for the truth, or you will never find it. "
