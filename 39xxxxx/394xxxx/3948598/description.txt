Summary:

Truth or Dairy by Benjamin Zephaniah - an excellent argument for veganism, describing the dairy industry and the suffering involved in producing dairy products.

Our most popular video transferred to DVD to enable the ethics of veganism to be shown on today's media.

Compassionately presented by Benjamin who is now recognised as much for his dedication to veganism as for his excellent poems and plays.
