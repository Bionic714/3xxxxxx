
Kevin had it all: An exciting pyrotechnic job, a caring family, and a beautiful wife. That is until a late night encounter with the savagely blood thirsty Christine prompts him to slowly turn against his family and co-workers. Now, with the help of the quirky and questionable werewolf hunter Kwan, two families from two different cultures will unite for one common cause. Will Kevin betray the ones he loves in favor of the one he lusts? From its first bloody death to its last explosion, Lycan draws you into a blood bath of beastly transformations and unbelievable gore. The film's unexpected and outrageous humor is the chaser that helps quench any gore-hounds thirst for horror.
