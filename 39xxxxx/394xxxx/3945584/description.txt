Keyboardist and composer Keiko Matsui performs a blend of jazz and New Age instrumental compositions before a live audience for the "BET on Jazz" program in Washington, D.C. Matsui and her band offer their renditions of "Night Hawks' Dream," "Kappa," "Night Waltz," "Forever, Forever" and "Light Above the Trees." Matsui also brings out her record-producer husband to play the shakuhachi (a Japanese bamboo flute) for the final three numbers.
