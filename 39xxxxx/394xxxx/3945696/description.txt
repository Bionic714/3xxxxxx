Weeds is a hilarious comedy, following other trend-setting shows like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under that deal with real life issues (using real life language). Sometimes wonderfully dark, and sometimes very blunt, the humour seems to suit each episode's general mood.
The quickly progressing story lines provide plenty of interest and we quickly develop a sympathy for the main characters through some genuinely emotional dilemmas, especially Nancy, but this is no doubt helped by the fact that she is a gorgeous soccer mum in distress.
The small number of episodes in each series might be a little disappointing, but is easily forgiven in helping to maintain the high quality and originality of each episode. 


Trivia:

The book Rejuvenile by author Christopher Noxon has appeared several times on the show. Christopher Noxon is married to series creator Jenji Kohan.
 Noxon was also the music supervisor for season one and appeared in the pilot episode as a bear hunter.
