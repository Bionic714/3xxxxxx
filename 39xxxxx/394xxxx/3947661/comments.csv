This one clarkson presents with a cold and complains, that unfunny posh southern cunt is with Ian and the news reader from channel 4 Krishnen Gurumerphi (sp?) is with Paul.

Alright episode, but if you have seen it before (think jokes about america invading iran and when the iranians took some English Navy hostage and they sold their stories to the newspapers) don't bother downloading."
