A couple of albums I got in Spain in 83. Btw, do they still translate album titles and track lists of foreign artists in Spain? The record store window displayed among other stuff two hit singles, David Bowie's "Bailamos" and the Talking Heads' "Quemando la casa".
These are the albums, grabbed from vinyl and remastered:

Orquesta Mondragon - Bon Voyage, En Vivo (not complete, I didn't grab the live versions of Bon Voyage tracks)

Cabinete Caligari (forgot the album title, check the tracks)

Siniestro Total - De hoy no pasa

Enjoy.
