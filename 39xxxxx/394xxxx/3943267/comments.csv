I got the full tilt boogie album, featuring all three formats, MLP, Dolby Digital, and DTS, all putting it out in Quadraphonic, as mixed by the genius, Alan Parsons.  All worked, but, I had the player and receiver for it.

If this DTS only version did not work for you, look for a file about 3.43 GiB, titled ""Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon - DVDA MLP + DVDV DTS"".  Download it, there will always be seeders for this, as it is such an awesome and seminal work.

Burn the image onto a DVD, pop it in, select whatever format presents itself and works on your system, grab a beer and kick back.

In surround sound, this music is the shit!!!  Spend the time and effort; this is worth it.  I have not heard anything better, ever.

Pirate Bay has it, and I will add myself to the seeders.

Follow Hyper - Trax' advice, he know what he is talking about.  Better yet, get Peer Guardian, and block the scumbags who want to make life miserable...

I also love it!  Thanks for posting.

Do you know of anything remotely similar for Wish You Were Here?  The only thing I have ever found is this Q8 rip:

,kiefspoon,2008-04-15T18:21Z,"Wow! Thanks very much for posting this. Sounds superb. I have made a CD audio version of this Q8/DTS mix, as it sounded so good I did a (real-time) copy to an audio CD. You can find this here: http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/4136292/Pink_Floyd_-_The_Dark_Side_Of_The_Moon_%5BUK_Q8_Quad_Mix%5D_CD.4136292.TPB.torrent

Many thanks again for posting this torrent - it's a real fan's delight, and it's essential along with your posting of the Q8/DTS mix of Wish You Were Here.

Thanks again!"

,Avro_Arrow,2008-05-22T03:04Z,"Works Great!
Just burn the aiff file in Nero as an Audio CD.

Thanks so much for sharing!"
,schrism,2008-05-29T01:11Z,"On 4-28-72 I sat in the center of The Auditorium to listen to Eclipse (A Piece For Assorted Lunatics).  There were speakers at my sides, behind me and in the balcony.  Rick Wright had a crank (like a butter churn) atop his keyboards that directed the sound.  
This recording takes me back there.
I've only experienced great live surround sound twice, that night (when no one could have imagined it) and at The Mirage for LOVE.  (2007 surround sound Grammy)
Bravo!"
,schrism,2008-05-29T01:53Z,P.S.  Technical note.  When I burned the aiff in Nero I got some bad tracking errors.  I converted it to wav first for perfect results.
,coiler13,2009-05-21T13:33Z,"Thanks! I burnt an image, mounted it and could then play it on my pc using a xonar d2 to decode. 

I must say the mix is amazing, much more creative than the 5.1. This version gave me the chills listening to it. Thanks heaps!"
,bhobson333,2009-07-24T03:43Z,"Thanks for the feedback, coiler13.  I agree, this is an incredible mix and I'm very happy that I collected it years ago and can share it with you now.  I hope this torrent, in whatever version, is available forever.
