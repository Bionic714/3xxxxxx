,xXCAMEWIDESXx,2008-01-06T13:36Z,Realplayer SUCKS!!!! if you really want to spread this stuff use what majority of people use... I would love to download this but I don't want Realplayer taking over my pc.... Is there any way to get these somewhere in avi? I will upload them if there is  Thanks
,reelix,2008-01-07T16:22Z,I agree real player sucks

,reelix,2008-01-10T18:04Z,anyplace else to get it in another format??
,leadersupreme,2008-01-22T00:59Z,"Another great upload!! :)
Had an incomplete version form D'oid,
Those who don't like the format can d/l the file and change it to .avi if they wish...
.rv saves a lot of space for archiving, as I just converted a 4+Gig file to 470MB!!


Anymore ""legally"" stealing car vids?"
,TheRoomy,2008-02-03T01:35Z,"Why the hell would you upload a video in .ra format?  This shit should be restricted on torrent sites.  You're actually making watching a video a huge hassle for everyone by doing this, and it's not even worth downloading.  Why wouldn't you just have it in a format that, you know, programs can actually -USE-.  This is a torrent site, so you can assume the people here don't use AOL to log online and don't use the AOL equivilent, RealPlayer, to watch what they download.  Keep that shit in the moron sites, not piratebay.  People like you and people who don't say what language their video is in are why torrent sites suck today.

Oh and other guy, you can save as much space but still keep it in a format that everyone can use, not some shit with legal strings attached. "
,tiffany22,2008-02-15T19:20Z,Thanks. Don't know why everybody is whining about the format.  Guess they are clueless about Codec Packs and Media Player Classic.

,cupcakes,2008-03-25T03:54Z,"Real Player is fine, and anybody that does BitTorrent much should have VLC and Real Player anyway."

[T],XeroxAlto,2008-05-29T14:37Z,Do you all watch videos you download on your PC? I dont. I think most dont. So why is this in .rv format? What's the point in that? 
,starwolf1001,2008-08-04T02:52Z,if you don't like realplayer try GOM Player or Zoom Player
,Tremors12,2009-02-23T07:20Z,"I work for the finnish traffic department and my job is to LEGALLY ""steal"" cars  that are abandoned or are blocking the way of something. So when you ask ""how the hell can you legally steal cars?"", this is one of the very few jobs where you ""steal"" cars legally. My methods dont really differ from the ones that the criminals use..."

,peterlo,2009-07-14T09:34Z,"I found this vid to be of such poor quality, with sound either missing in parts, or out of sync, such that I could not bear to watch the full clip.
The tools used & methods employed are poorly described & there is too little by way of close ups.
It played OK in MediaPlyrClassic but used nearly 50% of my CPU resources, have not seen that before.
I promise you this is not worth dwnldg although that's a personal opinion.
To ""Don'tTreadOnMe"" who's efforts I greatly value & without whom we would all be less well informed: Please don't sacrifice quality, Id suggest not even uploading sub-std material, because the effort to dwnld a poor qual clip can be very disheartening."
