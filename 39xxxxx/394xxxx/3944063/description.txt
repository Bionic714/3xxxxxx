          The Heroin Diaries (the soundtrack to Nikki Sixx's addiction memoir of the same name)
          sounds nothing like the music that catapulted Nikki Sixx into the limelight (and,    
          presumably, the dank and dark underground of addiction) with Mötley Crüe more than 20
          years ago. And the music suffers for it. Perhaps Sixx didn't want to romanticize     
          addiction and ill behavior by unleashing a series of rockers that would send fists   
          high in the air and let the spirit, at least for a moment, soar while the listener   
          struggled to better understand the seductive lure of dependence and decadence. (If   
          anyone cares that much--this is rock & roll, after all, and not Oprah.) Instead, Sixx
          dresses the songs in the trappings of contemporary pop so that "Tomorrow," "Life is  
          Beautiful" and "Accidents Can Happen" sound like lite imitations of the lesser bands 
          that have captured the public's imagination in the wake of the Crüe's inexplicable   
          absence from the recording studio. ("Permission" may even be Sixx's first stab at    
          getting airplay on CMT.) The true rockers, far too slender in number, are            
          half-realized and pallid; the lyrics are overly diaristic (yes) and fail to live up  
          to Sixx's vintage street sophistication ("Dancing on Glass" and "Kickstart My        
          Heart"). The Heroin Diaries comes off more like an affectless pity party than a walk 
          on the wild side.
