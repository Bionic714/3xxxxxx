!?   just downloaded and only listened to 'life is beautiful' so far ----torrent seems good .  thanks"
[T],raidy,2008-02-06T05:44Z,"Just so you guys know, we don't write the reviews. We pirate them from sites like allmusic and imdb. So if your buying the cd to tell someone off, your only shoving your finger up your own arse; the riaa appreciates idiots who pay for it."
,mutulated,2008-02-25T00:40Z,At Least he has managed to battle back from it and be with us today or else there would be no motley crue or six a.m. for that matter.Cut the man some slack and let him do his thing. 
,aztekkrille,2008-02-28T19:59Z,"GUYS!
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER MADE. SIXX IN THE ULTIMATE ROCKSTAR
E.O.D"
,riccogrosse,2008-04-06T18:32Z,VERY good album...
,omicrondelta,2008-04-15T07:59Z,I'll never understand why you hacks decide to encode joint-stereo... What a waste of bandwidth...
[T],raidy,2008-07-05T05:15Z,"hacks? Heh... If those of you who can read:

Have a nice day"
,MetalexA666,2008-08-07T18:27Z,"It's a kick ass album, but my friend found something wrong with it. It's is the explicit version. But he fond that girl with golden eyes wasn't explicit, but the rest are. Juts wanted to mention that."
,wsopAntipop,2008-08-14T08:32Z,I just got home from CRUEFEST! Sw Sixx Am and Motley 2nite..They both kicked serious ass
,fuckvirus,2008-09-17T02:10Z,Do not download this CD unless you allredy bougth it. This CD costs 10 buks in the store so buy it! One of the best albums in the world is worth 10 buks!
,fuckvirus,2008-09-17T02:12Z,Btw.. Fuck you raidy!
[T],raidy,2008-11-15T23:01Z,Hah. What a lamah. Have a nice day in any event you punkass teenager. :)
,Trippin0ut,2008-12-06T21:26Z,So much hate... Not the biggest fan on Sixx Am but still worth listening to
,AbsolutZero,2009-08-16T02:53Z,"This wasn't written to be a stand alone album, it was written to compliment Sixx's book, called the Heroin Diaries.

So of course the album's not gonna but true to Sixx style, the whole thing is about his book!

Great torrent, thanks!"
,maturoi,2009-12-30T16:19Z,awesome :)
,romeorep,2010-01-24T15:51Z,where can i get his book?
,4layer2,2010-02-22T03:46Z,why would you tell people to buy something if youre on thepiratebay?
,davitodude,2010-06-25T19:01Z,Why wouldn't you pay for it? If you like it buy it an support a band you love. Makes perfect sense to me. 
,Sk4zZ,2011-05-15T07:01Z,"Thanks alot, raidy. Even tho I downloaded this CD i'm still going to buy it... this is by far one of the best CD I've been found in a while so it's worth buying."
,BenC89,2011-06-13T22:43Z,"I'm having a problem with this torrent; all the songs skip, like a scratched cd. I don't know if anyone else has this problem? I've downloaded this torrent twice and same thing happened."
,LessEpic,2011-07-25T10:46Z,"lol @rsw3000

Thats why i got the torrent.

Thanks btw @Raidy"
,Himeno,2011-11-02T07:00Z,it really does sound like a giant pity party. I only like two songs...... I was hoping to find more of their stuff.... find out what my mother liked about them so much before she died and... this is.... not what I heard of them......... such a fall from their songs previously..... if I want angst I will properly go listen to evanescence or linkin park thank you... at least with them it isn't a pity party.
,Chief615,2011-12-05T14:31Z,"i wont blame the uploader but that write up is complete bullshit. Sixx: A.M. was never meant to sound anything like Motley Crue !! Some of the songs may be a little mediocre but they were written to go along with Nikki's book The Heroin Diaries just for the hell of it. If any of you actually read the book or his newest one ""This is gunna hurt"" Nikki says himself he never imagined or expected this band to get as big as it has. him and the members of the band wrote these songs for fun (and side note : How the fuck do you expect him to write happy high voltage rock and roll songs about struggling with a heroin and coke addiction, dumb ass) "
