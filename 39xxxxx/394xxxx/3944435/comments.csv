There are other books out there available such as Murder Without Joy: The Complete How To Kill Handbook and it is just what it says and it goes deep into every possible way to kill someone from what is known as the T zipper shooting to poisons to how to get 3 chemicals (2 are legal and 1 is difficult but available) and the mixture and the small coke type vial needed, drop it into the gas tank and boom the car explodes.   
And so I strongly disagree with the banning of the book. And it was banned only because the family of the murdered woman sued the publisher and the government, of course, saw an opening to take away yet another of our civil rights and so there really was no choice. I have the book and it is truly a fascinating read as is the other I have and many many others that I have and would convert to .pdf form if I knew how."

In 1993, a triple murder was committed in Montgomery County, Maryland, by a man who claimed to have used the book as his guide.[1] James Perry, who had been imprisoned for violent crime, was caught, convicted, and sentenced to death. He had been hired by Lawrence T. Horn, who sought to receive the proceeds of a trust fund that resulted from his ex-wife's suing a hospital over injuries to their son. The families of Mildred Horn, her son Trevor, and her nurse Janice Saunders sued Paladin Press, the publisher of the book, claiming Paladin Press ""aided and abetted"" the murder. The suit, Rice v Paladin Press, claimed that Paladin Press had a share of responsibility in the murders by virtue of their publication of a book that, by Paladin's own admission, could be used by criminals and would-be criminals in the solicitation, planning, and commission of murder for hire."
