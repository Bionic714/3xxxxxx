...drteeth: I had to see for my self and you are right indeed, probably the crappiest Dr. Who movie/episode ever made! Just sad really.
The fans will dl it anyway, but all others, be warned!!! This movie sucks!"

First. It's NOT a movie it's a bloody TV show.
Second. It's the Doctor.. Be careful or he'll come visit your mother with a contraceptive..
Third. What is this Blue Box doing in my.........Connection Lost. User Name Unknown >End Trasmission"
