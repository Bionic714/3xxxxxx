,Frodge,2007-12-20T19:21Z,Great upload for a small aircraft. Thanks =)
,palmofsweden,2007-12-20T19:51Z,Thanks! Is this any better then Carenados aircrafts?
[T],supaturtle,2007-12-20T20:03Z,"i have waiting for your comment, palm, lol. dunno. just grabbed this from ng and seed it. try it 4urself"
,palmofsweden,2007-12-20T20:45Z,"Did you read my ridiculously long post in the Vfr Germany West torrent? Read it if you haven't! I'm seeding the ass of myself, lol."
,Yxin123,2007-12-20T20:54Z,"to palmofsweden ; definately not better than carenado. Their old aircraft looks and feels much better than this. The pipers, except the arrow, that you find on freeware sites like simviation and flightsim.com is better than this.
CLS actually charges money for it?
Anyways, its free in here ;) Thx for the up! :)"
,palmofsweden,2007-12-20T20:58Z,"Yeah, that's what I thought. Then I'm going to stay with the excellent Carenado series."
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-21T03:51Z,CLS Makes Excellent Airbus Planes with Just Flight. Certainly the best I've used. Especially the Just Flight A340/330 Pro Series has a fully functional MCDU. Good Up  and I agree that the carenado little planes are not only amazing looking but the fly great and the VC's are excellent.
,Joshpilot1234,2007-12-21T06:29Z,request flight1 Pilatus PC-12 for fsx. thanks
,Panodilo,2007-12-21T09:17Z,"Thanks a bunch, Milton. Lots of good upz lately, Supaturtle. Now I can flame the developer. Come on, CLS suck flamingo cock. Their Airbuses are accurate from a cosmetic point of view, but the avionics and flight computers are grotesquely simplified and downright WRONG. Another (bi)product from CLS are their texture packages which make your sim look like Elizabeth Taylor's bowel movements, with just two clicks of a button. This GA aircraft looks boring and uninspired, but I'll take it like the thief I am and add it to my disgusting log of warez, of which I have been able to try roughly 25%, but I so enjoy downloading it. Fuck me."
,palmofsweden,2007-12-21T10:31Z,"Yeah, fuck you Panodilo, lol."
,Panodilo,2007-12-21T14:30Z,Intriguing offer! Are you gonna make me cum?
,palmofsweden,2007-12-21T14:39Z,"Very funny. You're probably one of the most disgusting people on TPB and definitely THE most disgusting person on the flight sim scene.
And no Panodilo since I'm not gay and you're an old fart I'm not the one. LOL"
,Panodilo,2007-12-21T14:52Z,Allow me to remove my white silk gloves so I can pinch those pale buttocks of yours...
,Panodilo,2007-12-21T15:05Z,I always wanted to feel the whole palm of Sweden around the base of my beloved cock.
,palmofsweden,2007-12-21T15:11Z,"EUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
You've just crossed the line there, its war!"
,Panodilo,2007-12-21T17:51Z,"""THE most disgusting person on the flight sim scene.""

In a perfect world I could use that as a slogan in my flightsim articles, some of which you might have read if you go to the usual flight sim haunts. Ha ha ha!"
,palmofsweden,2007-12-21T19:10Z,"Haha, you sure have a personality too! lol"
[T],supaturtle,2007-12-21T20:04Z,"@palm, about the vfr germany west, i'm still seeding this awesome release from hangar. upload totally now 82,3 gb here ;)"
,palmofsweden,2007-12-21T21:43Z,"I uploaded a 1to1 ratio on all parts, but I needed the bandwith for playing online games after that."
,radar201,2007-12-22T00:40Z,thanx for the upload. Requesting Capt sim hercules c-130 fsX please
,Panodilo,2007-12-22T07:10Z,"So, my mom called to wish me a merry christmas. I was naked when I took the call, but that's not what I wanted to stress. Something occured to me. If you find yourselves feeling bummed out over the holidays, strip down to your bare asses, spread your buttcheeks and put your rectums square up against a leather sofa seat and let it rip. If a sweaty fart against leather doesn't make you smile, then... shit, I can't help you out."

,radar201,2007-12-23T00:11Z,"Hi I'm new here and I would like to give back to the FS community. So I've tried to upload MegaSceneryX Las Vegas since this afternoon, but it seems to take to damn long to upload. I have file in zip using winrar. Any suggestions? I've download quite a bit and would like to contribute.  "
,Anatol_Popow,2007-12-23T10:20Z,"I'm not uploading because those payware aircrafts i have, are allready uploaded here..."

,expextremist,2007-12-26T13:06Z,"thanks for the upload man...

but for an honest review of the arrow??

CRAP.

do yourself a favor and download the carenado mooney instead. as someone else wrote below... there are alot of freeware a/c out there that annihilate this junk... 

but this??? is just an epic FAIL."
