,Skateboardhomer,2007-12-20T18:14Z,"What does this crack do? How do I use it !?

Help please !"
,snapple1121,2007-12-20T21:31Z,"This crack allows Call of Duty 4 servers to do the following: 

    * Disables master server authorization check
    * Disables 30 minute waiting time
    * Disables valid CD-Key authorization
    * Increased amount of server slots(above 36, the valid server limit- meaning you can host a 54 slot server)

And yes, I do believe you can still play with this crack."
