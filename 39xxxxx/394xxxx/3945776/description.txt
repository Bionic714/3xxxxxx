The Year 1989, Christmas Day, East Berlin. Leonard Bernstein conducted "Beethoven's: Symphony No. 9". In celebration of the fall of the Berlin Wall. In this Version Joy(Freude), is replaced by Freedom(Freiheit) for the occasion.

This is a VIDEO of the 9?Th in its entirety. The Video Quality is 6.5/10 watchable, the sound a good 9/10.

If you don?t get a chance to see the 9?Th in person this Christmas season then having the video is a must, I watch it with good frequency. The performance is inspiring and very emotional as one of Bernstein?s last performances (Having died in 1990).
