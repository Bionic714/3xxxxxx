,Wububu,2008-03-23T22:31Z,I'm having a hard time loading this into itunes. I think its because the ID Tags are messed up. Is anyone else having this problem?
,kongfranzblower,2009-03-31T16:12Z,"just download winrar or something I like that... I suck at computers, but I made it - and I'm very pleased with the result. Not a bad seed at all - in the end.
Just extract the rar-file in winrar and you got mp3 files"
