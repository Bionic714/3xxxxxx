      From the myspace:

      The band was formed while we were still going to lower
      divisions of school, we started talking about playing music
      together after endless conversations about indie music in the
      pink corridor of our very 90's school. Since we liked the
      same kind of music and bought the same records our music
      became of great matter, specially since this was in our early
      teenage years. We began however to write our own songs in a
      very early state of our friendship, and even though we barely
      could do anything even close to playing our instruments good
      we managed to record 3 tracks on a tape. This must have been
      nearly five years ago, today we are, thank god, older and
      hopefully better musicians and songwriters... But everything
      else is still just the same as back then, at least the most
      important things. We still make music, and we are still
      friends. And in the end that is a good thing, but sometimes
      life has so much to offer, girls, school, parties and so on.
      That it gets hard to play as much as one wish. But these
      things are just important for a short matter of time,
      eventually and as always The Band wins... Cause it always
      does, and it always has to. Cause no matter what we will
      always have our band! Say isn't life kind of like a bicycle,
      however let's take a ride... /ByeByeBicycle!!!
