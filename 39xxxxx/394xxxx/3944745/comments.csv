,natansepitaph,2008-06-19T08:12Z,umm....how do you get it to work with scummVM on a Mac? I cant open it from the torrent client because it says its a .rar file and my operating system (leopard) doesnt have an associated program for that file type. And scummvm wont let me put that in...help?
,cj_,2008-07-17T06:10Z,"You need to UNRAR it. If you head over to macports and install that, you can install a command-line unrar tool like this:

sudo port install unrar

Then run:

unrar x fiilename.rar
