,chuckstaton,2008-02-06T05:33Z,"I followed the instructions accompanying this EXACTLY and the dvd will not boot.

If anyone HAS got this working. Tell me if I did anything wrong:
I downloaded the rar. Extracted it. I put Xmugen on my Xbox, under E:/Games/xmugen.
When I run it (with only one character, Sol), it works fine.
I add a character (add him to the ""char"" folder, add him to ""select.def""), and it works fine.
So I copy that exact set-up to the ""datafiles"" folder (and I replace the ""chars"", ""sound"", ""data"" and ""stages"" folders with fully-packed folders) delete ""mugenboot.cfg"" from my old set-up, and move ""default.xbe"" to outside the ""datafiles"" folder, with the new ""mugenboot.cfg"". I add
So now I run ""xboxmugen.bat"" to create the ISO.
I creat it, and burn it with IMGBurn to a DVD-R.
The system reads the DVD-R, loads all the text, goes to the first ""Now Loading"" screen, goes to the ""Electrobytes"" screen"", then gets to the second ""Now Loading"" screen, and I just hear the disk spinning, and spinning, and spinning.
I followed the directions included with the files EXACTLY. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?

NOTE: If I keep my E/Games/xmugen set up in my xbox, then run the DVD, it takes me to my E/Games version, and not the DVD version."

,jeezy103,2008-02-15T17:12Z,"although i do commend this guy for his effort, a step by step procedure would aswell go a long way....

""static/ash : can't access tty, job control turned off
joy@key -joystick one to keys
