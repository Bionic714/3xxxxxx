moreover the 32nd chapter ends at
""His wavering sight fell on the timer and
the sense of triumph returned, along with a cresting wave of righteous wrath.
Instead of connecting the timer to dynamite, the cord ran to the gold knob of a
stout black cane, like the one his father had carried after the accident with
the milk truck.""
