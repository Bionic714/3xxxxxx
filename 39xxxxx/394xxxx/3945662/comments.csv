,acsforever,2007-12-24T14:16Z,"Sorry for that, particularly I had never tested this emulator on Windows Vista.
I use windows XP and this emulator works perfectly."
,Projectil3,2008-01-07T01:29Z,"Hmm, why exactly is the file so big?

6 MB?

on the official project 64 website it's about 2 MB."
,acsforever,2008-01-08T23:07Z,"Simple.
This pack includes plugins, versions 1.6, 1.7.0.55  and Kaillera.
The version in Project64 includes only 1.7 beta version."

Do not trust this file!"

,squall_leonhart69r,2008-03-17T18:06Z,"THIS IS A FAKE VERSION

there is no Project64 1.7.0.55, the latest is 1.7.0.49 and is unreleased to the public, this version is a hacked release which includes a keylogger to steal your passwords by installing a DLL file that hooks into explorer.exe

I'm not shitting you guys, google my username and you will see im a member of emulation sites, i am also on the 1.7 beta and i provide status updates regarding the beta all the time."

,Satanhhh,2008-10-08T00:48Z,"Well I don't know if this works or not as Trend Micro Antivirus popped up with a warning of Troj_Generic in the exe file itself.  Personally, I'm not taking the risk."
,optimusprime5777,2008-10-08T05:43Z,"Overview -

This is a trojan detection. Unlike viruses, trojans do not self-replicate. They are spread manually, often under the premise that they are beneficial or wanted. The most common installation methods involve system or security exploitation, and unsuspecting users manually executing unknown programs. Distribution channels include email, malicious or hacked web pages, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), peer-to-peer networks, etc.

Characteristics -

This is a generic detection for trojans. Trojans come in different families like ""downloaders"", ""droppers"", ""backdoors"", ""password stealers"", etc. They are standalone applications that might cause damage to your machine by infesting themselves or introducing other executables to your machine.

They can act in various ways to steal your data, private information, or resources.

Trojans can also reside on hosts waiting for further commands from their authors to carry more attacks on other parties.

Symptoms -

Symptoms of malware vary greatly.  Some common symptoms which may be observed in the case of Generic.dx detections are as follows.

    * Unknown processes are running.
    * Unknown ports are open.
    * Reduced system performance.
    * Introduction of new files to the system

Method of Infection -

Trojans do not self-replicate. They spread manually, often under the premise that the executable is something beneficial. They may also be received as a result of poor security practices, or un-patched machines and vulnerable systems.

Distribution channels include IRC, peer-to-peer networks, email, newsgroups postings, etc."

and just because you download something that's an exe....doesnt mean it isnt zipped.
nullsoft and winzip have their own self extracting installers and they are executables."

,Nexxion,2011-01-05T08:22Z,"Ha-dur-durr-durr.

I swear, half the people commenting here have never downloaded a torrent in their life. Yes, this download can throw a false positive, but what is inside is definitely legit. If you're really paranoid, install the fucking thing in a sandbox application and transfer the files. Then rescan what you transfer. 

This includes versions 1.6, 1.7.0.55, and Project64k for online play. There are roughly 7.5MB of plugins as well. The only problem is a good chunk of it is in Spanish, if you aren't a fucktard, it is pretty easy to figure out. I imagine finding the language file and figure out what is up with that isn't hard to do.

And in case you are curious, I scanned it myself and nothing was found. I appreciate Project64 being worked out, but I'm not about to be gypped out of $20 to illegally play these games. (Even though I own almost all ones I play anyways)."

,LJ111,2011-04-19T08:00Z,"This torrent does seem to include some versions of Project64. It also appears to contain at least two trojans. During installation Nod32 (the best antivirus software I know of) detected and quarantined two files with trojans. Here's an excerpt from the quarantine log:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Project64\Project64k.exe	probably a variant of Win32/Agent.MKTXMYH trojan
C:\Program Files (x86)\Project64\NRage-Language-1034.dll	probably a variant of Win32/Agent.NCPYDY trojan

The project64 version does report itself as 1.7.0.55 but I'm unwilling to use it due to the fact that it's been identified as dangerous. I don't suggest anyone use this torrent, there are others on TPB that appear safe."
