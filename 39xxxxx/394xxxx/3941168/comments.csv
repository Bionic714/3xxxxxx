,cokebabies,2008-09-30T02:48Z,Is this still being seeded?  I've been at 96.6% for a week and a half.
,nedwin,2009-08-07T04:55Z,"damn, I am stuck at 45% and have been downloading for about 10 days now. When I get it will cut down to a 700mb .avi file and create my first torrent but will also seed to at least 1.0. If you've got this, please seed!"
,ZeNiTH_NL,2010-06-19T08:39Z,"Reseeding today until everyone who is leeching it has it. Please seed for a while okay? 
It took me an hour to find it again on one of my drives."
,scrub91,2010-09-30T01:52Z,Man I have 100% of the files except the .iso which is stuck at 99.9% completion. If a seed or the OP will help out for literally minutes I will seed this to at least 2:1
,Marieex,2011-03-02T22:27Z,Can someone please seed? I'm at 99.9% and will seed after. 
,gankoo,2011-03-21T07:46Z,99.9% and no seeds for a few days now. if someone gets me those last 2 megs ill leave this thing in my torrent upload list at least until it has some more constant seeders.
,dosanko,2011-08-10T01:56Z,"do want

,FFFITS,2012-07-23T09:04Z,"seed please?
