Good stuff."

,sixatonce,2010-01-03T00:46Z,Could you put up a lossless version as FLAC?
,iDerp9001,2011-01-14T17:47Z,"@sixatonce
I would also like this in FLAC if possible.
Thanks"

,dvkladfk,2012-01-17T08:18Z,"Ogg is an audio container format that usually holds audio compressed in the Vorbis format. Vorbis is lossy so it's like mp3 but it generally has a higher compression ratio while being higher quality than mp3. Worth while media players can play it, which means itunes can't ;) (at least not without some extra work)"
