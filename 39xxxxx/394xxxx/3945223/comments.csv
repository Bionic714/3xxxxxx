,GEE_GEE_GEE,2007-12-23T17:09Z,Big Thanks
,radgegadgee,2007-12-23T23:50Z,"128kbps music with 320kbps quality - how'd you do that then?

this is tested - how'd you do that then

not trying to be funny - you could save me a lot of space/bandwidth"
,R5e71,2007-12-28T21:41Z,"Tested means that there is no quality difference between 320 and 128 kbps music files. I can guarantee that. Converted with ""mp3 converter"". I hope you enjoy it. ^^ Seed too."
,R5e71,2007-12-28T21:46Z,"I convereted those files because it saves almost 50% space. Before it was like 5gigs. AND you can find Songlist at:

,farkin_hell,2008-01-26T10:41Z,"No difference between 128kbs and 320kbs? Your talking out your sphincter mate! Of course there is a difference, and an audible one too! Your obviously not an audiophile then are you?

I wouldn't download 2.61gb of 128kbps tracks (especially DnB or dance) you need the high bit rate to accurately reproduce the synthesized sounds. 128kbps is a waste of time! 320kbps FTW. "
,R5e71,2008-01-27T22:16Z,"to farkin_hell...... obviously you havent downloaded this torrent. Plz in the future would you say your crappy words after you have downloaded.

 .....ANd you say I am not an audiophile. Then why I wasted my precious time to convert these files and I bought x-fi soundblaster soundcard / 5.1 z-5500 soundsystem. Quality is Over anything.

I hope you will change your mind after you have downloaded this upload :( .     

All comments are welcome but plz be sure you are knowing what you write!"
,R5e71,2008-01-27T22:23Z,"Was there any point to convert these files if I would know that converting could reduce the QUALITY. I think not!       PEACE :D    ENJOY this torrent

,R5e71,2008-02-15T17:13Z,Fool are you ... compared my ass... you thought that i havent compared them ..lol whateva I just thought that ppl would appreciate my work and I should upload sec album ..but whateva.now there wont be.. anyway i didnt have all the original songs 320 kbps but those what were 320 ..I didnt notice any sound difference and I am done talking now ... I am now knowing that ppl are very lame -.- and dont appreciate any kind of effort. It is not my problem that you find some better quality files than i have. Ok enough if you dont like then thats all. -.- I am very suprised that some havent even downloaded and commenting this as shit upload. -.-.-.-.-.-.-
,torrentipoja,2008-02-18T19:45Z,"you are fucking noob with no ears at all
elevant pole sulle mitte kõrva peale astunud, vaid ta lausa sittus su kõrvadesse. elusees ei ole võimalik kvaliteeti langetades saavutada sama helikvaliteeti, ja kbps näitab justnimelt helikvaliteeti.

LAMMAS!!!"
,R5e71,2008-02-21T20:38Z,"Njh torrentipoja kas sa torrentit tõmbasid....inimesed võixid selle eelneva jutu unustada ja tõmmata nt mingi paar faili or sth ja kuulata MUIDEX EI SAA MP3 FAILIDE PUHUL MINGIST KVALITEEDIST RÄÄKIDA SEST SEE 
SUHT KONVERDITUD STAFF NII KUI NII aga muidex mul Creative X-Fi Fatality soundika ja Logitech z-5500 peal kõlavad need väga ilusasti .... äkki tahaxid enne mölisema asumist oma süsteemi yle vaadata või mis. 
Kui sa eelmiseid commentse lugesid va eesti tohman siis nagu sa näed: ei pea sa mulle enam kordama, et nagu mina olex retard or sth. 
Hirmsasti tahax teada kas sa oled yhtegi laulu kuulanud sellelt albumilt (siis oleks hea arutleda). Aga kui sa ple isegi yhte lugu kuulanud siis hoia oma elevandi jutt heaga omale. 
Mul suht poh need mölisejad , Btw sõbrad on ka tõmmanud ja on jummala rahul. Ofc vb mingi väike kvaliteedi vahe on aga sinu munni junni kõrv seda nagu ei kuule, nii et ole vait. VOT XD
Torrentipoja oled ise LAMMAS!!!!!!!!!! 
Unustasin veel öelda et 128 kbps ei näita helikvaliteeti (kuigi enamuste mp3de tõmbamisel on see jh nii), siis tegelikult on see 128 kilobits per second. Kui sa ikka veel nii juhm oled siis ma tõlgin sulle selle ära ehk 128 kilobiti (suuruseühik) sekundis, arvutused võid ise ära teha. "
,R5e71,2008-02-21T20:56Z,"I would've wrote this description differently...Those Mp3 files what were 320 or 192kbps (kbps is not showing you sound quality, it shows how many kilobits are fitting in one second) Were converted into 128kbps to reduce size but QUALITY stayed same (I couldnt believe it at first too but this converter what I used sucks ass [in good way^^]).
I didnt  convert those files what were 128kbps  and under that again (those mp3s aren't 320 kbps quality). 
Is there any more questions. Tired of negative one's. If I could go back in the past then I definitely would not upload this torrent, but what can I do I could not remove it either. So you have to live with it and love it ^^. "
,RainbowDissent,2008-03-05T15:51Z,"I don't think you understand how mp3 works.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3

""When creating an MP3 file, there is a trade-off between the amount of space used and the sound quality of the result. Typically, the creator of the MP3 file is allowed to set a bit rate, which specifies how many kilobits the file may use per second of audio, for example, when ripping a compact disc to this format. The lower the bit rate used, the lower the audio quality will be, but the smaller the file size. Likewise, the higher the bit rate used, the higher quality, and therefore, larger the file size the resulting MP3 will be.""

Bitrate IS quality. As you said, kbps is a measure of how many kilobits of data are played every second. Those kilobits are musical data containing the actual sound. The more kilobits, the more sound data, the greater the range of the sound. mp3 encoding works by cutting out sounds that are too high or low for us to hear. At lower bitrates, it also cuts out sound we CAN hear.

I compared your copy of Pink Flamingos to my copy, which was ripped from CD at 320kbps. The 320kbps has more powerful bass (makes everything in the room vibrate, the 128kbps doesn't) and the high synths sound clearer and have more depth. And I set them both to play back-to-back in a random order, 50/50 chance of either one being played first and I didn't know which was which, but I could easily pick out the first one as the 128kbps one.

Don't be put off by negative comments; take them on board as suggestions and bear what people say in mind for your next torrent. The high number of seeds shows that your upload is obviously appreciated by many people, people usually only comment if there's a problem or something they're not happy with. Thanks for uploading and contributing."

,Roland19303,2008-05-13T07:47Z,Yes well... if you had used a state of the art AAC+ HE codec or something then I might believe that it sounds similar (still lots of loss though). However from one mp3 file to another? Pfft what are you a retard? 128kbps compared to 320kbps is easy to hear AND its definitely worth the extra bandwidth.

just dl it if you love dnb and electronical music 
I recommend ;) Cheers"
,mrd0g,2008-06-28T16:19Z,"I want all my vinyl to be lossless and as close to the original master as possible.
If the only copy available is 128 kbps then I will gladly have that copy until a better quality one comes along.
It's what comes out of your speaker. If you are downloading a torrent, you are not paying licensing so piss off about the quality and be grateful that somebody feels the music enough to bother to upload it for the wholeworld.
When you snivelling turds upload the best quality please feel free to paste the link here in the comments.
We would all be glad if you did this."

Awesome torrent. 
Nothing but smiles here =]"
,Spiral13,2008-08-25T03:14Z,"Okay, I'll start with the 128kps being as good as 320kps. There is a VERY big difference in quality, obviously you have no idea what good sound is (or) you don't have good enough speakers to tell the difference. The second thing, you advertise this as 2007 DnB however most of the music listed is either a. old or b. would get your knicks pulled up your ass crack by someone who really loves and knows the music. I'm not trying to insult you so much as trying to get you to pull your finger out of YOUR ass and click on some research pages. If you want good current dnb, look at the delirium packs and sort through the garbage. Aphrodite has been a joke since before 2000 and rollers are long dead. I give you credit for the few good songs on here, but over-all this torrent is a waste of space and falsely advertised. Learn your music rookie... You are breeding a whole new genre of uneducated people who think they know what the hell they are talking about because of your piddly 406 out dated songs."
,k0nt4kt,2008-12-26T10:00Z,LOL . there's Psytrance songs in the torrent !!!! wtf you called it drum and bass?waste of time . quality is crap . have you heard of format mp3 pro? Nero 8 wave editor codes in that format.
