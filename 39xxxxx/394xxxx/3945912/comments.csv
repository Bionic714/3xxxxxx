,AnemicRebirth,2007-12-24T04:48Z,"On a side note: This will fully activate Alcohol as your own copy...not as someone else's copy. This is a true patch.


If you are confused by the instructions...

1) Install the program.
2) After installation is done, open the Keymaker.
3) Enter in whatever you want into the 'Name' and 'Email' boxes.
4) Copy and paste the serial that comes with this download and paste it into the 'Code' box.
5) Then click ""Activate"", then click ""Register"", and finally click ""Patch Server Check"".
6) Enjoy your own copy of Alcohol. =]"
,AnemicRebirth,2007-12-24T21:20Z,You're very welcome. Merry Christmas. ;]
,delawy,2007-12-26T21:33Z, thanks
,ysmuse,2007-12-28T04:51Z,"AnemicRebirth:

I did exactly what you instructed but when I opened Alcohol 120 it showed Unregisted... and prompted me to type code and email address.. What should I do?"
,AnemicRebirth,2007-12-28T06:45Z,"Read my top comment if you missed it. I'll post it again...

1) Install the program.
2) After installation is done, open the Keymaker (make sure that the program is closed).
3) Enter in whatever you want into the 'Name' and 'Email' boxes.
4) Copy and paste the serial that comes with this download and paste it into the 'Code' box.
5) Then click ""Activate"", then click ""Register"", and finally click ""Patch Server Check"".


This should do the trick."
,ysmuse,2007-12-28T07:42Z,"Thanks AnemicRebirth for your prompt response. 

I did installation exactly as you indicated. Somehow, it still doesn't work. I installed it on a Windows Vista box. Is that could be the problem?

Thanks."
,chopin10,2007-12-29T03:24Z,"I'm having trouble with the keymaker. When I click patch server check it says, ""not original alcohol soft file""... whats wrong?"
,chopin10,2007-12-29T03:36Z,"I'm sorry, I just got it to work. Thanks for the torrent."
,jerryneyk,2007-12-29T11:53Z,"Thanks for the upload!  Read the instructions and still cannot figure out what to put in the server box.  It says 'newer version, you try check/uncheck!, no matter what I put in I get a 'range error'.

Sorry to pester you with this, this is great work on your part and am just trying finally to get this working.  Thanks for your help!"
,ysmuse,2007-12-30T07:52Z,Itied with Wind XP it works but Vista. Is anybody here installed it on Windows VISTA? Thanks.
,AnemicRebirth,2007-12-30T12:48Z,Jerry...you don't put anything into the server box. You leave it alone.
,ysmuse,2007-12-30T18:32Z,"AnemicRebirth:   Thanks for uploading and answering our questions. It works with Windows XP and seem not working with Vista. Have you tried it with Vista?  Thanks, man. "
,astonius,2007-12-30T20:01Z,"Anemic, the reason people keep uploading other versions is because yours does not work with Vista.  I followed the included readme instructions precisely, yet it asks me to register whenever I start the program."
,jordanwb,2007-12-30T20:50Z,A strange name for a program. Don't you think?
,AnemicRebirth,2007-12-31T00:54Z,I've tested this in both XP and Vista and it works fine. I don't know why it's not working for others.
,AnemicRebirth,2007-12-31T00:56Z,"If the other torrents are working fine, use those."
,jordanwb,2007-12-31T17:48Z,Um yeah the keygen doesn't work. Everytime I started Alcohol I have to re-register and re-activate it.
,AnemicRebirth,2007-12-31T20:36Z,"I don't know how the patch could be any simpler. The keygen is not the problem, so don't act like it is by putting ""um..."" before your sentence and acting like the torrent is the problem. I'm going to explain this one more time. If you can't get it to work after this, I can't help you.

Uninstall the program if you haven't already. Now...install the program and make sure to not run the program after installation by unchecking the box that says to run the program after finished. If you need to shut down all the alcohol process before running the patch, then go to the Task Manager and end the ""Alcohol"" and ""StarwindServiceAE"" processes.

Now, open the keymaker. In the name field, put whatever name you want. In the Email field, put whatever e-mail you want. Leave the server box alone. Now, copy the serial that came included with the torrent and paste it into Code box. Now click the Activate button, then the Register button, and finally the ""Patch Server Check [Optional]"" button. It will say ""Successfully Patched"" on the bottom. Once you're done, close the Keymaker and open up Alcohol and you're done.

The first time you install Alcohol, it may ask you to restart the computer. So if you have to restart, do it, but make sure that the Alcohol and StarwindServiceAE processes are not running before you do the patch.

I've run this patch twice already and it has worked flawlessly both times in XP and I ran it once in Vista and it worked as well.

I hope that helps."
,AnemicRebirth,2007-12-31T21:53Z,"astonius...you need to click the Patch Server button when using the keygen, otherwise it won't work. The program checks the serial every time you load the program, so you absolutely MUST use the Patch Server button (even though it says optional, you need to click it anyway). It will ask you to register if you didn't patch the server."
,eclipse321,2008-01-02T15:40Z,Thanks for this one :)
,wax4949,2008-01-06T14:21Z,I think this crack has loaded trojan.downloader-gen beware. I loaded it and after that I was getting ndt2.sys errors. Has anyone else seen this?
[T],CaptainUnderpants,2008-01-07T20:10Z,"No, I haven't seen that and this one works perfectly. What you just said is also a false positive virus definition. There's another one on here with like almost a thousand seeds, you could try that one too."
,wax4949,2008-01-07T21:08Z,"CaptainUnderpants, I found out where I got it. It was Nero 8  http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3958163/Nero_8_Ultra_Edition_8.2.8.0___Keymaker.3958163.TPB.torrent  .....Loaded it right before 120% Sorry for the mix up. Thanks"
,game-a-holic,2008-01-10T02:45Z,"uh, could somebody tell me how to mount a downloaded image to a drive, im tryin to  play alone in the dark 4 but theres 3 cd's that i have to mount...i relly need the help cuz i tried with magicISO annd anything else ending with ISO but they keep asking me to insert a disk into the drive!!!!"
[T],CaptainUnderpants,2008-01-10T21:47Z,"Hey game-a-holic... use Daemon Tools http://filehippo.com/download_daemon_tools/

It's free. It will ask you to restart the first time you install it. After you open the program after restart, turn all the emulation options on and the mount the image file you want. I've yet to find any program that can match Daemon Tools in terms of proper mounting. Good luck!"
,Koorime,2008-01-14T02:13Z,Seed...please!
,bustbunny,2008-01-15T03:56Z,"im sorry, anemic. but when i do this, i always get a range check error... ive followed your steps and ive tried it a million times... help me please.. im using windows vista btw"
,Benjammin822,2008-01-20T01:14Z,"Works great! 

Thanks for the upload."
,tech12,2008-02-01T04:53Z,"When I try to install the program I get an error:

""unable to create service, error code 1450.""

And then the installer quits.

Is my download corrupted?  Anyone have an idea what's causing this...?

It's running on windows XP."
,marational,2008-03-10T23:41Z,"Omg! Easiest crack ever! THANKS so much Anemic Rebirth.

I'm so used to apps, cracks, hacks, and emulators taking hours, days, weeks, and months to work for me."
,daba210,2008-03-11T13:16Z,"Couldnt get this version to work with Windows Vista Home Premium SP1, repeatedly confronted with 'Range Check Error' when using the activator, however the torrent, (also hosted by AnemicRebirth) at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3902168/Alcohol_120__1.9.6.5429_Retail_%5Bclean%5D worked perfectly for me, and is completely Vista compatible :)."
,andythecurefan,2008-03-12T02:28Z,"listen asshole, how about you bitch at the hundreds of other people that have uploaded the same shit over and over.

,NoBlunts,2008-03-19T21:45Z,This crack is gayer than a man in high heels. At least it works and its virus free. Loader cracks suck.
,misterXXX4life,2008-06-09T02:06Z,"Ok I must be a dumb Fuck too. I have Windows Vista Ultimate. I get a ""range check error "" message. I tried disconnecting for the internet prior to clicking the patch.. I tried un-installing and re-installing. I followed the directions step by to no avail. Does anybody in here have Windows Vista  have this working. If so, How did you get it to work. And Please explain in great detail for the slow motherfuckers with Windows Vista. "
