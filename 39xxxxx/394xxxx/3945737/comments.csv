,VinYl_RiPPa,2007-12-25T05:54Z,"This is your personnal opinion, markxing, and you've got the right to keep it for yourself.

As you seem to be a typical full-time gamer who wasted his whole life playing games with guns and action, based on your other reviews, this is quite normal this game just doesn't fit you.

I find this game amazing, even more particularly for it's 3 megabytes size, and am playing it non-stop since more than a week - and I am thinking that once the player ""got it"", this is, indeed, really entertaining. You need skills and intelligence to play such kind of games, two important qualities you seem to be deficient of - particularly the last one.

Most players agree with me and YOU will agree too. Download ;)"

,blksmoke813,2007-12-30T03:54Z,i thought it was quite interesting.  i bankrupt the company about 5 times b4 i figured out how to keep things running smoothly... especially when i learned that i had to let the land rest or it became useless.. it could use some better instructions though..
