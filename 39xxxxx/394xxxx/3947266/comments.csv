,danielkyra,2007-12-31T14:48Z,This is the real thing. It's a great movie thanks
,Orasai,2008-01-06T11:59Z,"thankyou sooooo much! Tonight there shall be a room full of geeky men all staring at my tv.

i better go buy some potato chips."
,Orasai,2008-01-06T14:03Z,"just an update, movie was acceptable quality at the beginning and improved to DVD standard as it continued, the 3D was unfinished but far enough along to phase out the missing textures ect. toward the end they got a little lazy in the spesh effects but all is still understandable.
sound was excellent, movie was entertaining.

an exceptional download, i highly recommend."
,minin29,2008-01-08T22:26Z,Is this the movie that comes after the last episode of Stargate SG-1 when SG-1 and Gen. Landry got stuck aboard the ship?
,DuhokBoy,2008-01-09T00:18Z,yes
,Feanor48,2008-01-25T15:58Z,"Great upload DuhokBoy! As others have said the quality is not DVD but is entirely watchable, better then a TS or Cam that?s for sure. That said I have not been able to bring myself to watch the whole thing. I?m a big fan of the show and its stars and for some stupid reason I feel like this is cheating on them. I know, I know. I?m mental.

Anyway good upload and thanks for bringing this to the scene. "

,riquez,2008-03-02T08:23Z,"There is no sound for this movie in VLC & no Mac version of smplayer.

First time ever VLC wouldn't play something, therefore i conclude this movie uses a gay codec."
,riquez,2008-03-02T08:31Z,OK. mPlayer for OS X will play this with sound.
,jakesp,2008-03-04T00:25Z,I love the special effects in this especially the bit with Orified Adria
[T],white_napalm2008,2008-06-13T02:44Z,"Great quality. Thanks DuhokBoy.

Riquez: VLC player plays the avi file just fine.
            Update your version of that player.
