Summary:

Stargate: The Ark of Truth is a planned direct-to-DVD movie that will be written and directed by 
Robert C. Cooper. The movie went into production in April 2007, and will be released in the US on 
March 11, 2008. The production budget was $7 million.

This movie will be the conclusion of Stargate SG-1\'s Ori arc, which began in \"Avalon\". The Ori storyline 
was originally expected to continue into SG-1\'s eleventh season, but the series was cancelled by the 
Sci-Fi Channel in August 2006. Therefore, the movie\'s storyline will pick up after \"Unending\", the SG-1 
series finale, but will take place before Stargate Atlantis\'s Season 4.

Plot:

The movie will cover SG-1\'s attempt to recover the \"Ark of Truth\"

The \"Ark of Truth\" is a piece of Alteran technology developed before the Ancients left for the Milky 
Way. In an attempt to prevent the Ori and their followers rising to power, a device was created that 
could essentially \"brainwash\" individuals, for instance Priors, into believing whatever \"truth\" was 
programmed into the device. The Ancients\' non-interference policy and belief in free will resulted in 
the device never being used. Even though the promise of Ascension promised by Origin is a lie, the 
freedom to believe was something the Alterans ultimately decided they did not have the right to restrict. 
SG-1 likewise faces the moral and ethical issues raised by the use of the device.
