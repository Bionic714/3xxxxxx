I'm seeding 100-150 kB/s 24h/day, there are lots of leechers atm so please be patient.
I've tested it on several systems with XP and Vista, just make sure that you have the latest drivers and DirectX versions and it should work without problems.
I've included the original executable (nfs.exb) so you can install new updates when they are available. :)

1. Just one thing size is less bcoz you compresses it using the 7zip!

Did you run RegSetup.exe, checked the Minimum System Requirements, tried driver updates (video &/or sound)?

You can download & try No-DVD/Fixed EXE #2  @  GameCopyWorld + try the No Intro Fix.
Sometimes the Intro Videos  are the problem.

@ SSJSoldier24:
Run RegSetup.exe & delete the savegame directory (My Documents\NFS ProStreet).
Try to launch the game from the shortcut on your Desktop."

(in my opinion.)  it doesnt have a nfs speed spirit. race is on the tracks only and it gets  a bit booooorrrrrrrrrringggggg.   thanks for the upload
