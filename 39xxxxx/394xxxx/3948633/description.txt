      Bernd Glemser plays Sergej Rachmaninovs piano concertos:

              - CD 01: Piano Concertos No. 1 and No. 4, Rhapsody on a         
                       theme of Paganini                    
              - CD 02: Piano Concertos No. 2 and No. 3

      The german pianist Bernd Glemser has a particular affection for the 
      virtuoso music of the 19th and earlier 20th century. He devoted many 
      of his recordings to Rachmaninov for whom he feels a special affinity.
      Glemser has won several prices, including the famous Tchaikovsky and
      Rubinstein piano contests.                                           
      
      This release is part of the upcoming Glemser edition by MRL and will
      be followed by further CDs featuring this great pianist.
