,kestrel127,2008-06-05T17:45Z,"No, this is not a great torrent. It should be called the worst remixes.

I'm a huge fan of techno/club remixes, but this is just horrible.

Take Beautiful Girls, for example. You hear one verse from the actual song, then there's about 5 minutes of techno music with no lyrics or melodies of the original song.

These aren't fucking remixes, they're god damn techno music with one or two versus of another song thrown in in 3 - 5 minute intervals. 

Take ACDC for example, you can find some remixes of their songs that are incredible. They're not from 2007, but that's a good sample to go by.

Give us some real fucking remixes."
