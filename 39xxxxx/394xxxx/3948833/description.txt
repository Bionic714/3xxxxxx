IMDB Description: Maxx is a purple-clad superhero living in a cardboard box. His only friend is Julie Winters, a freelance social worker. Maxx often finds himself shifting back and forth between the "real" world and a more primitive outback world where he rules, and protects Julie. Mr. Gone, a self-proclaimed "student of the mystic arts" seems to know more about Maxx and Julie and their strange relationship than they could ever guess, but he's not exactly telling all....not yet, anyway.
