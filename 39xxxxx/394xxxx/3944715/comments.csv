This is confirmed with the 80GB PS3 model running the 2.10 firmware.

Thanks so much for these releases! They make watching things on my PS3 so much easier then attempting to convert things myself.. I wondered if you cared to share the process you use to take a 720p film and make it PS3 ready? I love your releases and always download and share them, but there are some films I have myself that I would love to convert with the same quality and playability as your releases.. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!"

,captainkaten,2008-10-23T20:34Z,fritax and DrFarnswoth what about converting on Mac?
