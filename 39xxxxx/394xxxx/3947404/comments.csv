,BlackBug,2007-12-25T18:09Z,And a big thank you again for sharing this one in parts and not as one big RAR file  ;-)
,PHBFO,2007-12-26T13:18Z,"Thank you!
What is the unifier if I may ask?"
,rrsousa,2007-12-26T14:53Z,"Tks again for sharing.
Happy 08!"
,Panodilo,2007-12-26T14:58Z,"Excellent! Thank you for this! The downside is of course that I can't hide behind the 'it's a bug' excuse when I'm splattered on a fucking hillside. Anyways, thanks a bunch.

FS9 updater

As we developed the PMDG 747-400X, we found that many of the fixes and optimizations that were designed into the FSX version of this software would also benefit the FS9 version that many of you already own. Since we want to provide you with as much value as possible for your purchase price, we decided to build an update to your FS9 747-400 Queen of the Skies so that you can benefit from the optimization and changes we made even if you elect to fly your FS9 platform occasionally! 

When you run the PMDG 747-400X installer, you will have the option to install a COMPLETE installation, or a CUSTOM installation. If you select COMPLETE installation, you will notice that a second installer launches near the end of the FSX installation process. This installer is the FS9 747-400 Queen of the Skies updater, and it will bring your FS9 version up to the most current standard. 

You can prevent this installer from launching by selecting a CUSTOM installation, and de-selecting it from the list presented If you wish to run this installer later, you should re-run the PMDG 747-400X installer, select CUSTOM and re-select this option. The installer will then drop the file into your FSX/PMDG directory and you can run the updater manually. 

Please note that the FS9 PMDG 747-400 Queen of the Skies updater will require you to validate your ownership of the PMDG 747-400X, as it is a requirement of ownership. 

Also please note that most of the new features contained in the FSX PMDG 747-400X are not available within FS9, as they are based upon behaviors that are native to FSX that are not possible within FS9. Please see the README file displayed by the installer for more details."

What I do:

install the 747 pax and enter fake reg data, click validate and then next with the enablebutton tool. This way the passenger version is ok, but can't do the same with the F as the installer terminates after clicking validate saying that the data could no be validated.
