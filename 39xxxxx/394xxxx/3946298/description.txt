Episode 09 - Allegiance

Original air date: August 9, 2002 
The Tokâ??ra and rebel Jaffa fighting along side them suffer heavy casualties when Anubis' forces overrun SG positions in the Risa system. During the funerals that follow, a scuffle breaks out between Ocker, a Tokâ??ra and Artok, a Jaffa. Meanwhile Carter discovers that someone has tampered with the Naquadah reactor. Realizing that a saboteur is on board, Oâ??Neill shuts down the gate. When Ocker is found dead, Artok becomes the prime suspect and tensions between the two uneasy allies threaten to boil over. But an autopsy showing that Ocker and his symbiote had their spines severed from behind, not in a face-to-face encounter like those favoured by Jaffa, points to Artokâ??s innocence. Before he can be freed, Artok is found dead in his cell. There is no sign of resistance and no explanation of how the killer entered and exited Artokâ??s cell. A riot is averted when Bratac finds the killers tracks and the group splits into search parties. One search party turns up dead. Then enemy attacks and kills Bratac. Tealâ??c and the other rebel Jaffa are furious with Malek for failing to help their leader, but he swears that Bratac was attacked by some invisible force. They realize that the killer is Nirrti, a highly trained gouâ??ald assassin equipped with a cloaking device. Carter alters the Naquadah reactor to produce an electromagnetic field that reveals their invisible foe. Nirrti quickly shuts off the reactor and begins killing everyone in the room. At the last second, a badly wounded Bratac reappears and kills Nirrti with a series of deadly staff blasts. Bratac and Malek make amends, bringing the Tokâ??ra and the rebel Jaffa closer together in their fight against the evil gouâ??ald empire.

Episode 10 - Cure

Original air date: August 16, 2002 
SG-1 pays a visit to Panger, where a working Stargate has recently been discovered among some ruins. The Pangerans, who are a few decades behind Earth technologically, have developed a miracle drug called tretonin that makes the immune system â??impervious to all disease.â?? The Pangeran leaders, Tegar and Dollen, offer to share the secret of tretonin. In exchange they ask SG-1 to teach them how to use the gate for interplanetary travel. However, the planets they ask to visit are all gouâ??ald homeworlds, which are strictly off limits. When scientist Zenna Valk hints at some kind of problem with the tretonin, Tealâ??c and Jonas visit the facility where the drug is made and discover gouâ??ald symbiotes living in tanks of murky water. Dollen admits that the symbiotes, which are critical in making tretonin, have been bred in captivity by a gouâ??ald queen. For the drug to work, he says, the dosage has to be steadily increased. If patients stop taking it, their immune systems shut down completely. With the gouâ??ald Queen dying and demand for the drug growing, they Pangerans decided to procure another queen. Jonas translates the inscriptions in an underground chamber and discovers that the so-called gouâ??ald queen is actually the long-lost queen Egeria, the origin of the Tok'ra. A Tokâ??ra woman named Kelmaa breaks into the Egeriaâ??s chamber and sacrifices herself to give the dying queen her host. Egeria wakes up and reveals that she purposely passed on the imperfection in the tretonin as a defense mechanism. Realizing that the Pangerans mistreated her out of ignorance, not malice, Egeria reveals how to make the antidote and thousands of lives are saved.

Episode 11 - Prometheus: Part 1

Original air date: August 23, 2002 
When TV reporter Julia Donovan gets wind of a top secret project called Prometheus, the president orders General Hammond to kill the story. An incensed Donovan threatens to alert the foreign media, forcing Hammond to offer her a tour of the project in return for an exclusive at a later date. Prometheus turns out to be a spaceship combining human know-how with alien technology recovered from a spacecraft that crashed in Alaska in 1978. While Jonas and Carter give Donovan and her producer a tour of the bridge, the TV crew - Smith, Reynolds Jones and Sanderson - overpowers the guards and activate the shipâ??s lockdown controls. Carter goes to investigate and runs into the hijackers, who manage to lock her in a utility closet. The hijackers demand the release of two prisoners, Colonel Frank Simmons and the notorious gouâ??ald scientist Adrian Conrad. Carter contacts Oâ??Neill by radio and tells him the hijackers are trying to steal the X-303, but itâ??s too late. They escape as soon as Conrad and Simmons are board. Oâ??Neill and Tealâ??c give chase in a pair of much smaller X-302s, which are able to dock undetected by the X-303â??s partially finished security system. As the vessel heads into hyperspace, Conrad tries to kill Simmons. The two struggle and Conrad ends up dead. Oâ??Neill and Tealâ??c find Simmons, who turns out to be gouâ??ald just like Conrad, and a vicious battle ensues. Just as Tealâ??c is about to die Oâ??Neill activates the airlock and Simmons gets sucked out the door. As the X-303 drifts helplessly through hyperspace, the Asgard leader Thor appears and appeals for help battling an infestation of replicators that has over-run his homeworld. This sets the stage for next weekâ??s conclusion, â??Unnatural Selection.â??

Episode 12 - Unnatural Selection: Part 2

Original air date: January 10, 2003 
After rescuing SG-1 from hyperspace, the Asgard leader Thor asks SG-1 help fight the replicators that have overrun his homeworld. The replicators, box-like robots that have the ability to think and evolve, consume everything in their path with an instinctive thirst for the knowledge and experience of those they devour. Thor explains that the Asgard lured millions of the creatures to the planet in an attempt to slow their evolution with a time dilator. Instead the replicators used the device to speed up time, allowing them to evolve at an astonishing rate. SG-1 finds the planet paved in a layer of metal replicator bricks miles thick. Five humans confront the team and order Carter to stop tinkering with time dilator. When she refuses, the humans reveal that they are actually replicators that have â??mergedâ?? with human forms. The replicator-humans, named First, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth, disarm SG-1 and probe their memory banks, allowing them to see what the team is thinking at all times. Fifth, who seems sympathetic to SG-1, taps into Carterâ??s mind where their communication canâ??t be intercepted and agrees to help the team escape in return for safe passage from the planet. Faced with the risk of unleashing an army of replicator-humans on an unsuspecting galaxy, the team has no choice but to trick Fifth into missing the ship. Carter reconfigures the time dilator and starts it up just as the replicators realize whatâ??s happening. Fifth is captured, but the device quickly slows time to a standstill and allows SG-1 to escape. A replicator ship veers toward Oâ??Neill and crew but it is consumed by the force field expanding outward from the time dilator as SG-1 heads for home.
