This is tribute band Wish You Where Here.
Do you have artwork of these DVD's?"
,JoopCD,2007-12-30T10:23Z,"Oops, the artwork is on DVD 2
lol"
,JoopCD,2007-12-30T11:22Z,"Oh no, it's not there too.
It would be there if you had made an image from the original DVD.
Copying the DVD this way the artwork files are lost."
