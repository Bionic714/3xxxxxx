Using innovative technologies of visualization we contemplate one of the most inhospitable places of the planet: the frozen Arctic desert, where the temperatures come to fewer 50 degrees and to survive is to be on the edge of a knife.

We follow a young man I dare macho and we observe how learns to defend in this implacable world. The thermosensitive cameras provide us an analysis of  guidelines of search and of assault. And across images route satellite we see how the polar bear travels hundreds of miles on the ice and the sea to find food.

Secret cameras infiltrated into the worlds hidden from the polar bear and their victims analyze the strategies of these animals. We do not bring over to its prey from new angles, and expose the secret methods of hunt for the polar bear: how can it smell to its prey to 40 kilometres of distance? What does make seem to it to be invisible under certain types of light?
