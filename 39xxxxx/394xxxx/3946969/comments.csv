,gerart666,2007-12-25T02:52Z,Please seed if you want this torrent to live for other people.More releases will come after this is being helped at seeding
,Furiosus,2007-12-27T18:31Z,"Stuck at 31.6% for me, went reasonably fast early though.

I think the problem is probably that there's 0 seeders and 881 leechers... so no seeder with the full file."
,gerart666,2007-12-28T00:28Z,"well,i did seed for a long time,and i have a crap up line,but if people would help to seed it would have helped alot.i will open it for seeding again for 24h or so"
,Deznaj,2007-12-28T09:29Z,"Seems like all these so called ""PLAYBOYZ"" releases are slow as a sticky turd! I've been downloading two of them for the past few days, and they're both stuck.

Seed or get of the pot dammit!!!"
,gerart666,2007-12-28T13:01Z,"like i said above,i have a crappy upload line.i did seed this alot earlier,but no one who got to 100% helped seeding.guess this is the pay to do this on a public tracker"
,asshound00,2007-12-29T02:34Z,"Sorry!  I don't have anything to whine or complain about, yet.  I just wanted to say thank you sharing this flic!"
,gerart666,2007-12-30T03:41Z,"thanks for the nice feedbacks, i will give you more after i have re-seeded this one so people get 100% please check out my other uploads if you like this one"
,sweets1970,2007-12-30T18:32Z,"Thanks for the upload Gerat666...but may I suggest that next time you unrar the files.  Raring a video makes zero difference to the size, etc.  Thanks again."
,gerart666,2007-12-31T12:26Z,"sorry Sweets1970,but if ONE rar file is not working properly,its easier to upload a file on 15mb then a 700mb file instead.so,i will keep to split them up"
,DeafnDumb,2008-11-18T23:41Z,SEED PLEASE I AM STUCK AT 98%. iT STARTED WITH 3 SEEDERS NOW NOTHING
