,TheModGod,2009-04-29T06:04Z,"Ordained is that like Catholic for full of shit? Seriously Priests do not know everything now do they? They know exactly what the Vatican decided to put out from his huge vast libraries of Theologian knowledge.

Here is a perfect example, a book of the king james bible that was never released with the bible. And it does NOT support ""Satanism""

Its called Livri Luciferius, Google it sometime and read it knowing you only have to believe in it and not sell your soul to get whats promised, it is dependent directly on God and the Bible.

Christian and Catholics have NEVER supported Wiccan or Pagan religions so why would they start haha?

I am I Dark Theologian, Meaning I specilize in spirits, Demonic entities, Angelic entities. You know all that stuff they have always told you was bullshit."
,Renken1,2009-08-31T07:01Z,oh themodgod PLEASE email me and tell me about wiccan :) im christian but i am absolutely facinated by wiccan and have always wanted to practice it. any kind of witchcraft at the. my email is randy.renken@yahoo.com
,momof5,2010-01-17T17:29Z,"It's funny how Wicca and Paganism has been around longer than Catholics and Christianity and all the other religions.  Wicca has been trashed as Satan worship for too long.  How is embracing Mother Earth, the natural Elements of our world, that we survive off of, wrong?  And someone tell me why the hell a Priest is on TPB downloading things!  lol  I cracked up laughing!"
,agroves4,2010-03-01T00:07Z,"for those who are too ignorant to find out, there are ordained wiccans who are priests and priestesses.
But like whitelitr says, karma will bite you in the bum 3 times over with this kind of thing."
,Dremin_th,2011-02-14T17:05Z,"First thing mentioned in this book, in red letters  is:(BE aware of the threefold law with this kind of spell!).
There are, also, plenty of warnings after the spells, so, I do not think anyone can be misleaded and think these are the normal type of wiccan spells.
So, I think that knowledge is not complete if not knowing what is. However, the wisdom of the person will be the criterion on how this knowledge will be used.
I can only say that Love and Compassion are the key factors in our evolvement. If you decide to ignore them, you will evolve slower, if any.

Thanks go to the uploader, for I think knowledge should be given to the people, and the knowledge he offers is not deceptive, the warnings are there. 
If someone wants to play with fire, is always welcome to it, but (s)he is warned that they might get burned! We are born free, free to do whatever we like, provided that we do not harm others. IF we do, let us be prepared for the concequences :)"
