,Anon08,2008-01-01T06:37Z,"I have downloaded this torrent and it is great quality. The movie is in spoken French but the torrent comes with a subtitle file that you can synch to the avi file. To do this you need to download ""VobSub"" software and then follow the instructions provided to synch the subtitles. Very easy. "
,tallboston,2008-01-02T20:39Z,The files list shows one AVI and two TXT files - where are the subs? Are they internal to the AVI file?
,tallboston,2008-01-03T15:42Z,"Subs are internal. Plays fine with Eng subs in VLC.. choose Video/Subtitles Track/1

Audio is 96kbs CBR, 32000 Hz.. odd choice for a music film."
,onthespot64,2008-01-06T17:00Z,Please lets all seed this great movie. Thanks. :)
,se7ve,2008-01-11T19:31Z,I haven't finished downloading this torrent but for thos using Windows Media Classic to play the movie... rename the extension '.txt' to '.srt' . It should work then
,plinny,2008-01-22T03:43Z,"i am having the same problem as francis100, SOMEONE PLEASE HELP!"
,GonzyMai,2008-02-25T21:19Z,"I use nero or nti but cant add subtitles in txt format, only str, can anyone help on this?  any link to subtitles for this movie?"
,romat,2008-02-26T05:31Z,"The NYT review says most of the songs are subtitled, but neither the embedded nor the one on Pirate Bay have them.  Maybe someone who saw it in the theater could comment."
,gwbushisgay,2008-02-26T14:57Z,"could someone please help with the subs.......

I'm seeding !!!!"
,free_FR_moviez,2008-05-06T05:17Z,"here's a tiny file that has subs for the whole film: http://subscene.com/The-Passionate-Life-of-Edith-Piaf-AKA-La-Vie-en-Rose-Mme-La/subtitles-69561.aspx

you'll need a program like VLC to read the file.

to use the file, simply unzip it and click ""use subtitle file"" when opening the AVI in VLC

you can get the latest version of VLC here:
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

It is completely free, supports Mac and PC, and is amazing for playing any sort of file (without even having the codec installed)"
,owlhighness,2009-01-08T10:34Z,THERE IS APSOLUTLY NOOOOOOOOOO SEEEEEEDS!!!! EVEN ONE SEED!!!!!!!!
,vegarcaek,2009-03-30T15:36Z,"lol you idiots english subs ARE included. There's a .txt document with the same name as the .avi file - just write .srt instead of .txt behind it, and make sure subtitles are on in VLC.

The dimensions are as listed in the descrpition: 720 X 304 - which is better than most rips so this one is of good quality. And the seed was still good - and i'll keep seeding it for a while. Thanks a lot FXG!"
,libertaswv,2010-04-23T03:01Z,"C'mon people....How often does FxG team release movies with crap quality? I can think of one time, and they took it down soon after uploading it (as well as a sync problem with '17 Again', but i don't know if that was ever addressed). The point is, it's freakin rare. As for subs - FxG is the rarest uploaders in that they nearly ALWAYS include English subs (look at the top of the torrent listing where it says:

 ""Spoken language(s):
    French
Texted language(s):
    English""

FxG's uploads are among the most reliable on the net. Many people prefer different formats (not me), but if you like uploads that are under a gig, fast, have perfect or near perfect a/v, and come with eng subs included, there's no beating FxG."
,crimson85067,2012-02-06T09:10Z,there is no srt file for english subs in this torrent
,LeBieque,2012-03-01T12:35Z,"all good. Thank you very much!
(Audio is 96 Kbps, I wonder by how much would total file size increase if using 128 Kbps instead?)"
,sougoias,2012-04-05T03:23Z,"Thanks!
Gracias!
Obrigado!"
