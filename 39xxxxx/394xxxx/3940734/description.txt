Editorial Reviews
The Time-Life Treasury of Christmas combines both volumes of the series into a two-CD set. Christmas Spirit features some of the season's liveliest pop hits, such as Perry Como's "Home for the Holidays," Ella Fitzgerald's "Jingle Bells," and Julie Andrews' "Joy to the World," as well as mellower songs like Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" and Andy Williams' "Do You Hear What I Hear?" Meanwhile, Christmas Memories gathers more nostalgic Christmas favorites, including Gene Autry's "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," Johnny Mathis' "Sleigh Ride," Elvis Presley's "I'll Be Home for Christmas," and Guy Lombardo's "Auld Lang Syne." Comforting and traditional, The Time Life Treasury of Christmas is a worthwhile collection of some of Christmas' biggest hits. Heather Phares, All Music Guide
