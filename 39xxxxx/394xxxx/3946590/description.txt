         Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson's breakthrough cyberpunk novel.

  A breakneck-paced 21st-century novel, Snow Crash interweaves everything from
Sumerian myth to visions of a postmodern civilization on the brink of collapse.
Faster than the speed of television and a whole lot more fun, Snow Crash is the
         portrayal of a future that is bizarre enough to be plausible.


                                    Synopsis:

 Not-too-distant future - a world where the Mafia controls pizza delivery, the
United States exists as a patchwork of corporate-franchise city-states, and the
 Internet - incarnate as the Metaverse - looks something like last year's hype
                      would lead you to believe it should.

   In reality, Hiro Protagonist delivers pizza for the CosaNostra. But in the
  Metaverse, he's a warrior prince, last of the solo hackers, and the greatest
  sword fighter in the world. Now, he's racing along the neon-lit streets, the
skirts of his black leather kimono flapping, on a search-and-destroy mission for
  the shadowy virtual villain threatening to bring about infocalypse! When his
  best friend fries his brain on a new designer drug called Snow Crash and his
beautiful, brainy ex-girlfriend asks for his help, what's a guy with a name like
                      that to do? He rushes to the rescue.
