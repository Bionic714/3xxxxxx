,drbobloblaw,2009-11-09T04:07Z,The audiobook version of Snowcrash is awesome. The reader makes the characters come alive in a sci-fi story that is likely to be a favorite that you will listen to over and over.
,deviceone,2009-12-25T08:26Z,Thanks so much! Amazing book and the audiobook is superp! totally agree with drbobloblaw. The reader makes it happen.
