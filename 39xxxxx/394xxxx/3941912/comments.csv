,axelboribur,2008-01-03T15:10Z,"not working, my ladies and dudes. Image is invalid"
,nocturns,2008-01-06T20:59Z,"It's not working for me either, with MagicISO there's an error after mounting, and with DAEMON nothing's happening."
,forrestkeller,2008-01-18T03:29Z,"* SOLUTION *
First I tried to burn it, and yes it was corrupt.
So i decided to do these following steps and finally it worked.
- Unrar the file
- Open the ISO with 7zip or winrar (dunno if it'll work with winRar)
- Extract all those files into a new folder and rename it Halo PC
- Launch Magic ISO, Ultra ISO or Power ISO
- Drag all those files in the Halo PC folder into the ISO program
- Then click BURN 

Done! It should work so dont give up or miss out on this awesome game!

Dammit."
,FearHeldDear,2008-02-10T20:23Z,"Everything worked fine for me up until I went to actually play it then when I hit play it gives me an error saying: ""Please inser the correct Halo CD-ROM...""
I have no idea what to do now."
,ToasterofJoy,2008-02-23T02:26Z,"FearHeldDear and any one having this problem, I have found the solution. It was happening to me aswell. So lets cut to the chase,here's what you have to do.
1. assuming you already installed it, go to where ever you installed it and update it with the haloupdate program
2.copy the halo from the crack file in the iso directory or if you unrared it that one works as well(note:copy not copy shorcut)
3.paste it on the folder where the ""original"" halo is found at(it should prompt you to replace it click yes)
4.initiate the game and enjoy"

I have a couple questions:

Where is the 'halo update program'?
I don't know what the crack file is, nor the iso directory.
Also, is the original Halo supposed to be located in the Halo PC folder (it is mentioned in one of your comments to rename the folder to Halo PC, that is what I am talking about).

I am at the problem where an alert comes up and says, ""Please insert the correct Halo CD-ROM, select OK and restart the application.""

Little help, please?"
,tadija,2008-04-29T15:25Z,"ok, heres a step-by-step.... first u unzip halo1... than u unzip halo (i used 7-zip)
u install the game using a key from the key generator in the keygen folder
once the game is installed (by default it should go to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games) u access halo folder (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Halo) and run haloupdate app
when update is complete u go back to halo u downloaded and unzipped, from where u started the setup, and find a folder named crack... in that folder u'll see a halo image.... copy that image and paste it in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Halo.... when u get prompted to replace the file click on yes... run the app and enjoy the game"
,forrestkeller,2008-06-12T14:26Z,I will upload another torrent with it fixed and working but i couldn't include the keygen because i lost it but i provided them in the readme. ill post the link when i finish
