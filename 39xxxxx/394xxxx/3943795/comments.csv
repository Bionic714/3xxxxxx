Nice Format To Try....Insane Quality...Although not accepted by the Scene...

Misterpitydafoo.. thanks bro.....

What kind of program did you use?
Just wanna give it a try 'cause it can be played on my Philips standalone...and seems like it will be supported by more devices...


This is the true Mortal Kombat Movie dudes...."

You'll be amazed how easy the program makes creating divx videos and adding subtitles, audio, ect. I could just rip it as divx but I got a new dvd player that does divx ultra and i thought the features such as multiple audio tracks and embedded (and removable) subtitles. I know it hasn't been used too much in the official scene, but it is pretty useful."
