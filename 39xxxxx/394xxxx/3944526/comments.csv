,ILoveSeb,2007-12-31T02:11Z,"Hey guys. I'm having a problem and I don't know how to solve it. I don't know if this is the exact same torrent that I came to to download it, all I know is that I downloaded and installed Diablo II and the expansion.
So anyway I installed it fine but I've been reading the read-me that came with it and this person must not speak some damn decent english but this is exactly what it says at the part where I'm at now:
""after install is complete, open up install directory and re-name Game.exe in install directory
to Game.exe.bak.

Copy Game.exe in this folder into install directory.
Play""

What the fuck does this mean? I installed it just fine but when I go to the area where I installed the game C:\Program Files\Diablo II and I find the file that says Game.exe, I'll change the filename like it asked and I get a popup that says ""If you change a file name extension, the file may become unusable. Are you sure you want to change it? So I click okay. I try to play it but it doesn't work. Whenever I click on Diabli II OR Lord Of Destruction to play the game it says ""Diablo II was unable to find game.exe. Please make sure your application is correctly installed, and that your Expansion Disc is in your CD_ROM drive, and try again.""
I even tried mounting the Expansion install disc but NOTHING worked. Please help me!!!"
,Voodoonutbag,2008-01-01T19:13Z,"Sigh. I don't see the problem.. i understood that just fine.

What he means is: after you renamed Game.exe to Game.exe.bak it's just a backup..  Just in case something goes to crap.
The point is to COPY the GAME.EXE from the CD to your INSTALL DIRECTORY because it's a CRACK. And a crack is this thing that does something so you DON'T have to use a cd to play. Rightoooo?"
,ILoveSeb,2008-01-03T00:05Z,"Thanks, got it. 

I got past that part but I developed a bigger problem, finding a proper no-cd crack. There are no proper ones for Diablo II that actually work that I've tried."
,Zomged,2008-02-01T15:21Z,"I still don't get it. The comments above aint giving me shit :( I think i need a crack, but its impossible to find"
,murphy4u1212,2008-02-06T03:20Z,"Okay, I have finished the download and I have installed Diablo 2. Now when i click on the shotcut to play Diablo 2 it says my play disc is not in, even though i have the diablo2playdisc mounted using daemon tools

Can anyone help me? How to I get it to run? I hear about copy exe or whatever but im lost and I dont want to have to redownload this whole torrent again.

thanks"
,dedy45,2008-02-10T15:04Z,is it just me or this is for MAC?
,bloggin,2008-02-11T13:29Z,"when i try to install game it says: Please insert the CD labelled ""Install Disc, please help"
,matti992,2008-03-10T02:51Z,"i use alcohol  120% for my virtual cd's, it works just fine.

you mount the image onto the cd-rom and it will open. If it asks for a certain disc then you just mount that disc."
,Fruktpapper,2008-03-14T18:10Z,Hey .. I can open install Cd or any cd .. what do i need to open them with ?? .. do i need to open them with Winrar or something plz tell me =)
,MagicalJoe,2008-03-21T00:29Z,"Lost your legit LOD cdkey??

Okay guys I did some work for Blizzard North back in the day and I know how their serial system works. With that.. I also know its flaws.
In beta testing for LOD the test team I was on was having huge problems with our keys being recognized by bnet so what the developers of the online portion did was link the D2 classic cd key to the LOD key when it was entered on bnet for debugging purposes, they also made an automated email service where you send in your DII classic cd key in a specific format and it sends you your LOD cdkey that corresponds to your DII classic key.

Okay now on to the business end

I doesn't matter what email you use to send for the key.. as far as I know because my buddies all have hotmail and that worked for them and I used an old aol account and they all worked so I'm just assuming the others (live, yahoo, gmail etc.) work too...

so first off make a new email to:

blizzard.north.battle.net@gmail.com

long story as to how blizzard.north.battle.net went to gmail (used to be blizzard.north.battle.net@bnet1g.com)

with this in the subject field:

%hg_seri%confi_em1

^copy and paste that!! VERY important

then in the main body paste:

%hg_loas/%termin3;6
%lordod*diab_x2%recev
%(your diabloII cdkey here)
%tmit_rsendr% hed1

so it should look something like this:

%hg_loas/%termin3;6
%lordod*diab_x2%recev
%6PNPD7P1HZ8MPZNP
%tmit_rsendr% hed1

REMEMBER!! do NOT but dashes in the cdkey! the program cannot read the key with dashes in it!!

usually it comes back within 2 minutes but it took one of the guys in my team 2 days as I recall.

it will come back with both your DII key and your LOD key It could have my name in it somewheres because that's my personal code for the return loop.. anyways have fun and do it quick because if they see that ""I'm"" trying to get my lod key 350 times in a couple days it will get shut down so hurry!!"

,cybermazter420,2008-11-26T17:55Z,"HELP!!! I downloaded 100% In the folder diablo 2 full game with expansion, there is: D2 editor.exe/ and four .iso files that look like .zip files. I've opened every one up with daemon tools and every setup/install icons says ""no program start menu found""... WTF! I'm not all that new to opening and cracking these things. ALSO this comes with 2 keygens that work, but nothing to use the keygens for! I recommend NOT downloading this. 

Anyone know how to do it in steps???"

Anyone tried this high-resolution hack?:
http://www.blizzsector.net/hacks-bots-editors/48712-pseudoreso-high-resolution.html

It's a mod which makes the game run in 1300x700 resolution or something.
kinda crap to play a game in 800x600 with a 1680x1050 screen, so i gave it a try, but cant get it to work.
great thanks to anyone who might have some extra tips..!"

http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&articleId=20758 

this is a link to patch 1.12, it fixes several bugs and lets you play the game without a disk there is a version for the expansion and the regular, also sometimes simply installing it doesnt work, for example i have vista, so after i download it, i have to go to ""my Downloads"" and click the icon to run it manually, u may not have to do this"
,himee22,2009-10-08T17:16Z,"ive installed the game and played it, but why does it always crashes and it says ""unhandled exception; breakpoint... somthing like that, im using a vista"

,wtfronsson,2009-12-28T19:29Z,"So is there a crack in this release, or do I have to find one on my own? There sure are no directions.

Since there are lame ass editors included, I can't see why the crack couldn't have been placed right next to them.

I will meet the person responsible for this in hell, then me and satan are going to give him the assrape he deserves for wasting my time here on earth."

,MrEmilijan,2010-03-02T14:41Z,this shit has 2 trojan horses in it.... it's the keygen file that has them.

,ROFL_A_PIGGY,2010-04-25T20:11Z,"This works guys! Don't extract any of the WinRAR files when you download them. First, Mount the diablo 2 install disk and run the installation. Then when it tells you to insert the play disk or cinematic disk, mount those and press OK. Run the CD keygen and use the key you get from it to install the game. I installed the Full Game option and it is working fine for me. 

However, the expansion iso seems to be corrupted, at least in my download. I will try and redownload the expansion iso and try it again.

Thanks for the great upload, a classic!"
,ROFL_A_PIGGY,2010-04-25T21:50Z,"Oh and sorry for the double post, but what I use to mount the images is Daemon Tools Lite, it is free, it is by far the easiest to use, it is so simple, and it works!"
,ROFL_A_PIGGY,2010-04-25T21:59Z,"Lol crap sorry for the triple post, but thank you to ultrasloth7 for the information on the patch, I got that problem even though I had my game mounted and it didn't play, so the I downloaded those patches and now I can play!

And by the way I redownloaded the expansion iso and it worked.
