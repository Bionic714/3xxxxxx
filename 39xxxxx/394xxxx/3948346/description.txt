This a repack of all the different official addons I could find for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. All you have to do is download, unrar, and dump the contents into the "x/Program Files/Bethesda Softworks/Oblivion/Data/" folder. The included "DLClist.txt" has a list that will work for all these addons IF you already have the Knights of the Nine and the Shivering Isles expansions (which are part of the GOTY edition).


Good luck, and have a fun time playing one of my favorite computer games.
