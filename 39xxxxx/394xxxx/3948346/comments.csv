,emmom,2007-12-31T00:09Z,Thanx... at least it's on 18 KB/S now...         :/
,cdchris12,2007-12-31T04:32Z,I've been constantly seeding at 50KB/sec since I posted this torrent... 
,Grimsbo,2007-12-31T17:49Z,Very good torrent cdchris12! : )
,Catalyst666,2008-01-02T01:11Z,"This isn't all of them. Not everybody has the GOTY edition, which means you need to add KOTN. Also Battlehorn Castle is missing."
,thefusilier,2008-01-05T13:41Z,Where can I find Battlehorn Castle (fighter's stronghold) addon? I've looked everywhere!!!
,cdchris12,2008-01-05T14:02Z,"The fighter's stronghold is here, courtesy of myself.

,thefusilier,2008-01-05T14:13Z,"LOL, thanks I just found it. I must have been using wrong search words or something. Thanks."
,cdchris12,2008-01-06T04:38Z,I just put it up. I had to go looking for it myself.
,1135rt,2008-01-06T18:33Z,Thanx great torrent!
,Hand_of_Vecna,2008-01-15T06:51Z,"Amazing find, thanks so much!  Any chance of getting DLC Spell Tomes?"
,grymmefille,2008-01-17T17:13Z,Why just not download the knights of the nine expansion with all dlc including update and spell tomes?
,madisonfoxe,2008-01-22T18:37Z,I downloaded to documents but have had no success in moving to Oblivion Data Files -- I realize that I am substantially challenged when it comes to such efforts and would appreciate your help in a 'walk-thru'...plz?
,ScarredSaint,2008-05-11T18:10Z,this includes shivering isles?
,danieljackson,2008-05-19T04:03Z,"no this is an expansion set of official *plugins*

While shivering isles is technically a expansion it is far too large to be considered a plug in seeing as it requires 5 gigs just for itself so to awnser your question no shivering isles is not included but there are plenty of available torrents here on TPB that you can surely find"
,radnad616,2008-07-06T08:53Z,does this have the tomes?
,fidelcastro1976,2008-07-13T07:38Z,"thanks for this. been feeling like playing oblivion over again and never touched upon the official plugins (except for fighters stronghold).

I might just play through Oblivion vanilla this time. Maybe a couple of UI mods..and some graphic mods to make the game look better. Back in 2006 I wouldn't be saying that...damn you Crysis."
,pweb07,2008-11-27T20:38Z,"danieljackson KOTN is the addon not shivering isles, shivering isles is an expansion"
,pweb07,2008-11-27T21:10Z,where can i get the wizards tower addon and spell tomes addon?
,Topper42,2008-12-04T14:57Z,Frostcrag is the Wizard's Tower...as for the Spell Tomes I'm not sure
,gnetix,2008-12-23T02:33Z,Can someone help me out? Do I need the expansion packs to use the extensions? I just have the regular Oblivion game with no plugins. (Not the GOTY edition) Thanks for any nfo!!! 
,gravi_fan89,2010-02-16T23:27Z,"You're missing the ""Fighter's Stronghold"" add-on.  You should fix that."
,WesDaBest,2010-06-15T22:27Z,GREAT torrent. Pretty fast download too when I downloaded this. I will keep seeding as long as I can.
,bourque25,2010-06-17T17:47Z,"Amazing torrent, just what i was looking for!
Downloaded in like a minute or two, peaked at 690 kB/s. One of the highest speeds I've ever downloaded at. I'll seed over the weekend but prob not anymore than that."
,Rumb,2010-08-19T09:55Z,"Here's one for the Tomes.

,gapho,2010-12-18T01:15Z,"nice, missing spell tomes and fighters stronghold and knights of the 9 and shivering isles."
,cablife,2011-02-15T07:49Z,good stuff man. thanks!
,Black__,2011-06-13T22:09Z,"I copied the files like the instructions say, but I don't get the ""update"" for the new quests. How can I fix this? "
,TorrentMasterOHYEAH1214,2011-11-24T10:57Z,Can I get like a walk through or something? I downloaded the but I don't know what to do next...
