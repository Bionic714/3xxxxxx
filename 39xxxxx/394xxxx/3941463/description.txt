I worked on the subs a little to make them more readable, but they are by no means perfect.

This is a hilarious film from 1965 in which Communism is openly made fun of...I had no idea such freedom of expression was ever allowed in a communist country...our leaders were obviously telling us a few lies about life behind the Iron Curtain back then, because this film shows absolutely the same freedom we enjoy today in America.

Film is situated in a small town Komonice in the 60's, the time of communism where the only party, represented by chariman of people's committee and his secretary instead of taking care of the people's needs they build up a fountain. There's a castle in the Komonice and according to a legend there is good ghost in the castle - White lady. She emerges from the painting on the wall when someone speaks out magic formula. White lady builds up a water supply for an old woman who asked for that by the painting. Then she makes a new fence and pavement... Not only her acts but even her existence is not suitable for chairman and his secretary but they find something better than forbiden her. They want to make a plan for her which is going to be planned and then checked by local people's committee and than it would be presented as a work of working class.
