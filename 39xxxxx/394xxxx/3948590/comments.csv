If you find yourself capped at a certain download speed, that's because I work on a shared network and can't hog our house's bandwidth

If there's no seeds, more likely than not my computer is off or I've been nice to my housemates and stopped seeding so they can use the network, too.  Just wait around and/or shoot an email to torrents@joshdb.com"
