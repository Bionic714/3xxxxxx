Justin Martin is a name that we will be paying attention to as we go along in the schedule, and this track is still working wonders for me.


" Justin Martin's sound is both - melodic and tough. Justin first gained international acclaim for his single ("The Sad Piano") on Ben Watt's Buzzin' Fly label. The single made its way into many A-List DJ crates as well as jumping on to Pete Tong's Buzz chart, being selected as a "sureplayer" by DJ Magazine, and being dubbed "single of the week" by Update magazine in the UK. Justin Martin has established himself as the next generation of San Francisco house with the skills to hang with the current masters. "



Enjoy and please seed.
