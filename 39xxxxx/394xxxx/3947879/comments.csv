,maxx_jedi,2008-01-02T09:18Z,i cant wait for this to finish downloading. Thank you in advance
,SMcMorgan,2008-01-04T13:17Z,"These seem too short to be full audio books, and it does seem like they skip quite a bit from one file to the next. Can anyone confirm?"
,Carlsberg_40,2008-01-11T22:39Z,"compressed to fit into a old 128mb mp3player
so some files are are not the same kbps  khz"
,jjjerm,2008-01-20T04:46Z,"Just DL'ed this, and checked it.  Amazingly for the file size, quality is excellent...9/10 at least, but I'm very impressed at how small you were able to still shrink them down and still maintain such a high standard of quality.  Thank you Carlsberg_40, outstandingly done.  I'd be very interested to know how you shrunk them down so much while keeping the quality so good...that trick could free up a lot of hard drive space for me!  Thanks!"
,tricksareforkids,2008-01-25T20:45Z,great torrent!! good job in sorting and collecting them dude! thank alot:D
,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-02-11T02:30Z,thanks man.  Working my way through this.  Everything i've gotten has worked great!
,sirged,2008-02-15T08:30Z,book 1 of the corellian trillogy is out of order (the files have some parts that are turned around and have parts where the story changes without warning) do you by chance have a fixed version?
,Hednoize,2008-03-11T00:24Z,"Started listening to ""Bounty Hunter Wars 1 The Mandalorian Armor"". Seems like a strange jump between file 2 and 3.. also 3 sounds like it starts just before the last word in a sentence. I don't recognize the voice of the storyteller between those two episodes either. :S"
,Hednoize,2008-03-11T01:42Z,"About my previous post: Maybe it's the same guy performing it and just the difference in quality that's fooling me. By the way, Bounty Hunter Wars is a triology. ""Bounty Hunter Wars 4 Truce At Bakura"" is not a BHW book. (Also not same author)"
,DaFab5,2008-04-23T02:48Z,"Some files cut. Portions of the story are skipped.
Still listening but ""Star Wars 9 Years After Thrawn Trilogy3 The Last Command"" has repeated chapter. 
Other then that, I honestly can't complain! 
This is great!!! Just wish i could find the Jedi Academy Trilogy! Any1 seen it anywhere?"
,spookytoothe,2009-12-22T07:56Z,YOU ARE A GOD!!!  I love you man!!!
,cenzo6945,2009-12-31T21:15Z,"Can anyone give me the correct order to listen to these awsome audiobooks? i feel stupid, but does it start after the original Episode iV story? then 3years after, 4 years, 6.5 and so on? thanks carlsberg 40!!"
