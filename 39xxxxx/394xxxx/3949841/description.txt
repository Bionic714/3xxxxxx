Hey guys one of my first releases,
this is an dezender tool i found somewhere on some forums.. 
Worked a charm only problem was it was per file convert..
For your ease i wrote a bat file that saves you a lot of work :)

Use as following:
#1
Put dezender in
C:\dezender
Make sure this README will be in C:\dezender!!! ( Else the dezender root is someplace else and the bat wont work + php config )

#2
Put the program that needs dezending in _decode ( the whole program is fine ;), it will only parse php files but it will copy all other files to the decoded folder =) ).
#3
run decode.bat

Sit back, grab another beer, should be done shortly depending on the size of the program

#4
take a look in C:\dezender\_decoded\dezender\

Enjoy ;),
