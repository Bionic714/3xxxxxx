,Drake9669,2009-02-07T03:11Z,"I'll be seeding this for a while.  I loved this show!  I was so pissed they never renewed it for a second season.  I loved playing the RPG when I was a teen, and then they made a show about it!  Awesome!  It helped ease the pain of never getting laid in high school.  HAH!"

The lead actor (Luna) was killed in a motor cycle accident. That is why they pulled the plug on it :-/

You can read about it on wikipedia.

BTW: It is good to see that people still seed this one! I just had a disk crash, and now I can (still) just download it back from you guys and keep seeding it! AWESOME COMMUNITY WORK!"
