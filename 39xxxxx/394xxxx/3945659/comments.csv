This is just a mix of songs that most fashioncore-wearers listens to. I've been walking around downtown asking those in fashioncore what music they listen to, and some of them said CTTS, so therefore I included it."

,Wazabii,2008-04-21T12:09Z,"@Cyralund; I was waking around downtown and asking people that was wearing ""fashioncore"" clothes, and they named those bands I included. So the most appropriate name I came up with was ""Fahsioncore Mixtape"" because that's their style, and this is the music they listen to."
