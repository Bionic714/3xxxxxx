,bigh704,2008-01-01T21:46Z,My 87 yr old father-in-law loves Gunsmoke.  Thanks so much. I figure I can copy these avi files to his computer and let him watch them that way if nothing else.  Is there a way to convert/burn to a DVD so he can watch on TV?
,montavon29,2009-04-09T22:46Z,Please post season 3 if you can. I love watching Gunsmoke and seeing how the characters and cast come together from the beginning to what TV land is showing now.
