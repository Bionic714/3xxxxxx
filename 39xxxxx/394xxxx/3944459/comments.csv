,MTOakey,2008-05-14T22:46Z,"Guys,
It is easy!
Just burn all the files to a CD and name the CD what the error window say's it can't find: (US Topo blah, blah), then run the installer off the CD!
Installs Just Fine. Then You must delete the Mapsource.exe from the C:\Garmin directory and run the updater from Garmin to have the newest version. (6.13.7)"

Thanks"
,GTgradstdnt1,2008-11-06T14:08Z,"Can confirm that it works fine, even with a shortened cd name (windows write to cd only gives you a few characters).  If you dont have a burner or blank cd you can always record an iso using http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm and mount it with daemon tools"
,victoruno,2009-03-30T12:00Z,"Used the ISO Recorder from url of GTgradstdnt1.
Mounted with ISO, ran install, I already had updated my Mapsource. Installed fine, ran Mapsource.exe and just switched back and forth from the little drop down.

Works like a champ. and yes, this is east v2."
