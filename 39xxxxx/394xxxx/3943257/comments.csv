,scuba69,2007-12-30T19:28Z,"Dude, this was the easiest torrent ever to get working, and the thing works great .No trojans, worm or viruses. Do you have or can you get Adobe InDesign CS3 and After Effects CS3.  That would be great! Later"

Open the file until you see setup and open that, once its done open the crack file copy and past the PS icon to the PS CS3 file in your program files it will be in Adobe file."

After that go to program files, adobe, photoshop and you will see a file called photoshop with the same icon as the one you should have seen in the crack folder. All you really haqve to do is delete the original shortcut, file that says photoshop and paste the one from the crack  folder and your done."
