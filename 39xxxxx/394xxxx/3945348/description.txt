This is Heroes of Might and Magic II GOLD with stereo CD MUSIC.

It contains the cd audio soundtracks from HoMM2: The Succession Wars, which is the original.
This was done by merging a ripped GOLD iso with a full original cd.

So far everything seems to work, even the installer. Cd music is rather buggy on newer systems I found that putting the cd in the first cd-rom helps. (even virtually)

This is ABANDONWARE, and perfectly legal to share/download.

Also, I probably won't seed forever, please help spread this.
