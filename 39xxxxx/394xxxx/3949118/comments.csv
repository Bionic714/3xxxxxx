,Punkpik,2007-12-28T09:32Z,"These are dreamscenes, for Vista.
With the included StardockDeskScapes.exe you can use these .dream files as a moving picture on your desktop.
And I assure you there are quite nice and you will not regret it ;)."
,thoriswar,2007-12-29T09:00Z,plz seed iv been downloading this for what seems like a year and i have a 20mb connection so the quicker i get it the faster people get it lol 
,re0n,2008-01-02T02:49Z,"These are short HD videos that loop. They are for the Vista Ultimate Extra DreamScene feature, which allows you to make videos as your desktop background and they run on your video card so in doesn't bog down the system. Also Dream files are just a better way for making dreamscene animated pics. this guy supplies all the stuff you need to get started with dreamscene. ofcourse you have to have vista ultimate and dreamscene installed. my ultimate just got a the update automatically and installed it on its own. 
this is a MUST for all vista ultimate users."
,Punkpik,2008-02-04T23:22Z,"You could go to www.visthd.org to download them, but why not download this pack that has a collection of the best dreams?
I hate ads.."
,Fluidfox,2008-03-24T02:25Z,"important question:  the version of deskscapes included in this... is it 1.0, 1.02, or 2.0?  The installer size looks like the trial version of 2.0, if that were the case, that wouldn't be able to load any of these files since it is restricted to the 3 that come preloaded (packed into a DLL)  If it's the full version of 2.0, that would be great since I can't find it anywhere.   Also should be mentioned that if it's 1.0 or 1.02 it will only work on Vista Ultimate, whereas 2.0 works on any version. "
,Punkpik,2008-04-15T16:32Z,"It worked for me. 
Why would I post it if I hadn't tested it, huh?
And if this doesn't work for you then just download the program separately, you'll still have a nice collection of dreams ;)."
,andydrew316,2008-05-10T02:17Z,"This is only for windows vista ultimate. You can get this one from microoft if you have vista ultimate.  This is only compatible with ultimate not basic,home premium or anyother version of vista or OS. And if you try to get the one for the other OS beside ultimate it costs money. so i and others are looking for someone who already bought the program so we can use it:) it would be very appreciated.  thanx for the try bye"
,Darkenigma75,2008-07-29T02:51Z,"Andew, dude. 2.0 works with premium. They have this thing called the internet where you look up information. Try it sometime. "
,Darkenigma75,2008-07-29T02:52Z,"Punkpik, how did you get these to work? Just curious? "
,squidney2k1,2008-10-02T02:19Z,"This torrent contails DeskScapes 1.0, which only works on Vista ULTIMATE. You can download the free preview on 2.0, which works on any version of Vista, but you will only be able to use one of the 3 free wallpapers, unless you buy the Full 2.0 Version for $19.95.

If anyone has the full version of Deskscapes 2.0, please upload."
