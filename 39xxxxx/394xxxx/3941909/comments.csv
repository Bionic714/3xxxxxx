,cpgeek,2008-11-12T05:33Z,"what's wrong with m4a format?  any music player worth it's salt can play m4a, it's one of the most common file formats in the world... only more popular would be mp3 and it's almost the same in terms of compression, usually somewhat better."
,schoonsta,2008-12-15T05:32Z,thanks man
,Phrosty12,2009-04-09T21:33Z,"crap, it's .m4a :( , plus what's with the title? Rock Band? Spoon is not a ""rock"" band."

Moron."

Spoon could easily be consider a ""rock band"" since it's a fairly broad term.

Don't be such a narrowminded fool.  What would you classify them?  Pop, Indie Pop?"
,NuRome,2009-12-17T12:58Z,"m4a files may play but often cause problems in windows based software, such as wmp not being able to pause, fastforward or rewind m4a files. it is just itunes addicts trying to get us to conform to an Apple idea. hopefully it will go the way of fire-wire. long live USB! Sorry to be a dick but I always pass on m4a files unless they are the only ones available on something rare, then i just convert them with goldwave or cooledit."
