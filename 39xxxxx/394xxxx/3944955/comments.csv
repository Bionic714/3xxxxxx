,timwolff,2009-06-27T15:57Z,"am attempting to download this for my Mum who loves it - it is stuck on less than 6%. 
My Mum is nice - she deserves this - not enough that I will fork out to get it shipped from the US to her in Aust but enough for me to write this note hoping against the statistical likelyhood that someone will, having finished downloading this, for some reason come back to the comments section, read this note, and decide to reseed it. 
Ingekul may return and read this and reseed I suppose - that would be good too. Actually any seeding would be good. Stuck at 5.8% is not a lot of seedage from the community. Seed pls.."
