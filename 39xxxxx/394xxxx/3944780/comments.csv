,AnotherStranger,2008-12-07T00:13Z,"Can't believe this is so high in the IMDB rankings (#27), the over-use of studios
for supposedly outside shots spoils this one for me. If they'd just
shot on location it'd be so much better."
,PENumber1,2009-03-16T04:02Z,"AnotherStranger - Clearly you're clueless to the transition of acting from stage theater to movies.
They didn't have the budgets or the technologies, just substance that escaped you. How many movies do you think were on location during 1959?"
,jerryant,2009-04-25T07:04Z,Please help i have been stuck at 94% for a week but it shows there is 87 seeders.

However, quite an uninteresting plot makes for quite a boring movie."

,coreblimmey,2009-12-23T03:45Z,"COMMENT ON THE TORRENT QUALITY NOT THE MOVIE.
Are people here idiots, who comes to a torrent and gives their opinion of the movie?
Assholes!
Forum/comment etiquette is needed here urgently."
