Walking the line between commercial pop and synth pop, Espionage burst upon the scene in 1983 with their self-titled debut album on A&M. Led by Chazz Coghlan (vocals, keyboards) and Paul Hutchinson (vocals, keyboards), the quartet was rounded off by guitarist Nielson Kearon and bassist Gordon Goodwin (sessionman Dennis Conway occupied the drum stool). With the album produced by the legendary Roy Thomas Baker (and featuring backing vocals by Flo & Eddie), there was an initial interest with leadoff track "The Sound of Breaking Hearts" garnering some airplay across the country. Espionage's mix of British synth pop (Ã  la Heaven 17) and commercial rock (courtesy of Roy Thomas Baker's perfect production) on paper would seem like a mismatch, but this album proves that you can have the best of both worlds.
