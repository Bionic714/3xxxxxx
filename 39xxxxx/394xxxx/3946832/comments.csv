,mazzer123,2008-01-26T09:04Z,"see also 911 revisited (911_revisited_v2.avi). also, loose change 2nd edition is a quite different from final cut so worth watching even if you seen final cut."
,thematrixexpert,2008-04-04T23:31Z,thank you
,Tripps77,2008-04-19T06:33Z,"lol, atrax, this is not the 2nd edition, this is the Final Cut.  I would be very interested to see you folks try to pick apart the final cut with your nitpicking antics as you tried with the 2nd edition.  Spin, spin, spin, that's all you can do.  Doesn't work anymore, bro.  "
,mazzer123,2008-04-22T16:39Z,"good film but also see for more scientific analysis (less mood music): improbable collapse, e.g.:

,Pug_Fugly,2008-09-21T11:56Z,"Also worth checking out in addition to the ones posted here by other users is one called Wake_Up_Call_Remastered. It's all uploaded to YouTube in low quality, I think it's about 16 segments.

And as for Zeitgeist, the whole film is bang on with the exception of that shit about Jesus and the Bible. I know whereof I speak, I've studied the Bible pretty intensely off and on. The shit about it being based on Paganism is true, but only true of the Roman Catholic Church, which Revelation paints as the great Whore riding on the back of the Beast that rises out of the Sea. 

Dude, Catholicism is fucked eight ways from Sunday. Jesus was the real deal, hookers and thieves, and all he did was bash organized religion while on Earth. I really don't understand what's so hard to believe about Jesus' story, stranger things have happened; like Carrot Top winning the Comedy Award four days after Bill Hicks died of pancreatic cancer. Whoever made that decision owes his life to public execution."

,torerotomcat,2010-01-20T02:24Z,"I think all this is overdone.

I do not see Bush sacrificing 1000's of landsmen for his power.

In my view, the danger of having the building collapsing and falling onto other buildings ... killing 10'000's of people was too big. So they made it collapse vertically. Then for political reasons they cannot admit it. 

On back of that, all conspiracy lovers flock on it and bring the story to an unreasonable/unprobable scenario with a nasty Bush (he wasn't good ... but he is not evil !).

That their is frustration : OK
that their is conspiracy : OK
that the building was broken by govt : OK
that it was Bush for the sake of his power : NO"

,True_Atheist,2010-11-01T13:55Z,"@torerotomcat if you believe what you just wrote then you need to check out Operation Northwoods.  The short of it: in the 60's, the government created a plan to orchestrate and follow through with ""fake"" terrorist attacks on U.S. soil and to blaim it on the Cuban government so that they may invade Cuba and claim the missiles stored there.  We now know this as the Cuban Missile Crisis.  One of the things that was planned by the Kennedy Administration was to have flights populated by various government agents in disquise as tourists or people on business take off from various airports then land those planes in the desert and then as those planes landed they would send out identical planes driven by remote control and these planes would hit various targets all over the U.S., targets included the white house (which would, at the time of the ""attack"", contain only a few Secret Service agents and house help) and the NYSE.  So if you think that Bush, a man who is controlled by a Vice Pres who owns a company that directly profited from the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, is not capable of taking the lives of American citizens, consider what Kennedy approved in Operation Northwoods in an effort to not profit but END, not only the Vietnam War, but the Cold War as well.  Don't be so blind as to trust your government."
