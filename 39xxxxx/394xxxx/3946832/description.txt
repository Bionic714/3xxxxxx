   Loose Change Final Cut is the third and final release of this documentary
   series. It draws upon the experience and research that\'s taken place since
   the release of Loose Change 2nd Edition to make this new film.

   Loose Change Final Cut is substantially different from Loose Change and
   Loose Change 2nd Edition Recut in the way it presents the information
   surrounding 9/11/2001. However, it remains true to the spirit that has made
   Loose Change what it is today.

   Because we the creators are trying to accomplish the fairest documentary
   possible, they interviewed dozens of professionals who both agree and
   disagree with the official version of events of that day.

   Loose Change Final Cut is the best effort to tell the story of what happened
   surrounding 9/11/2001 and expose the events in need of investigation.
