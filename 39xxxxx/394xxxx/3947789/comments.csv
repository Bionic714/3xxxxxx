You see; the proof is in the pudding, not in childish name-calling and bigotry. I certainly would like nothing better than for you to get some true happiness and real enlightenment and love into your life. May God bless you in His mercy.."
,cheeto24,2008-09-25T07:46Z,"what the hell does God have to do with TPB?  I'm sorry, I apologize, I'm usually VERY close-mouthed when it comes to religious subject matter.  The bottom line is that faith is not a fact, all religions today are being carried out on the words of men, and there is nothing whatsoever wrong with trying to figure out the truth for yourself.  If you already have the power of God (or whatever name you call your greater power) in your life, then be happy, and leave others alone.  Religious oppression is the REAL cause of almost every war that's ever been.  So love your God, but keep it to your own heart and self, don't push it on others, and stop spilling blood in his (or her) name.  "
[T],verifire,2008-10-21T20:15Z,"Dearest ""cheeto24"". I don't mean to be rude, but I just have to ask: What on earth or in heaven do you mean? Is the Pirate Bay reserved for spreading porn, violence, and shit like that? Is your proposal that Christians should be banned from uploading nice, truthful stuff to try to make peoples lives a little better? While all others can and should upload whatever? Sorry, but I really don't see any logic in your comment.."
[T],verifire,2008-10-25T12:12Z,"Sorry, ""cheeto"", I do see a  little sense and truth in your comment when it comes to the spilling of blood in religion's different names, and Jesus' name have been dragged in the mud by deceivers just to gain what they lust for; power, riches and evil. And they will stand trial for this in His time. But this upload, and any other good and true upload of any kind, how could this be bad? Just download and see it, won't you? Pretty please..? :-)"
,Hell76Lx,2008-12-06T02:38Z,jesus had some good intentions(along with that other muslim guy and the hindu dude)the real problem is their agents!!!!
,datathief,2008-12-12T09:09Z,religion is a tool to keep people under the thumbs of twisted perverted people who live in a fantasy world... refuse and resist religion cuz in the end you all will rot in the ground... religion is a false hope for people who cannot stomach the fact of death... more ppl die for these supposed merciful dieties then from anyother reason in the history of man.
[T],verifire,2009-04-19T18:01Z,"True: RELIGION is designed to split and control the masses, for then to rule them. Religion, ergo sum, is a hoax by it's nature. Cunning and dangerous.
False: JESUS CHRIST and what He did and does IN peoples lives, and I'm then talking about things one have to experience to really know the difference, is proved beyond any reasonable doubt to be a scientific, historical fact, witnessed both at the time of Jesus' days in the flesh by more sources than any other event or man, and since then experienced by thousands upon thousands of born-again Christians.
My advice; don't swallow ANYTHING unless you've tried it upon reason, and in turn, try to just ASK: ""Jesus, if you're for real, can You show me? Because I don't know, and I'd really like to."" The way I see it, you've got nothing to loose, because if He's not real; you've lost nothing. If He's real, but doesn't answer such an honest and simple question, He'd have to be a... (I won't say the word.. :-) ...and not worth your time. BUT; if He answers, you've won the greatest price ever, wouldn't you say? Imagine: A person like that, answering you and being with you every day, loving and watching out for you forever? The only reason I can think of to be too stubborn to even try to establish personal contact with Him in this way, would have to be that you're afraid you'll have to change your ways, even if you know it would be for the better... Now, that's real stupid-ism.. Which is also some sort of religion, I guess.."
,datathief,2009-09-03T03:54Z,you dumb fucks i was lookin for lamb of god the metal band.... screw this religious bullshit dogma... 
[T],verifire,2009-09-08T17:08Z,"@""datathief"": It isn't dogma. It's Archeology. Try reading the uploader's description before downloading. That's always a smart move..

On the other hand, maybe somebody just like yourself or something, actually have downloaded this believing the same as you and watched it?
That'd be great.. Then they'd wake up in the morning with a new perspective on things maybe, instead of a splitting headache from headbanging... LOL :-)"
