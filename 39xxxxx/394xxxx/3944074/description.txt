Duran Duran - Falling Down (Sebastien Leger Dub 2007) [Electro House]


Switching up the flavour for today to some very sophisticated production on the Electro Pop / House side of things, here is another Sebastien Leger remix that I continue to enjoy...



There is no discogs entry for this release as yet...


I can't seem to find any information pertaining to label nor catalogue number for this particular release.

In any case, I've had it in crispy 320KBps for quite a while.

320KBps.



It's an extremely well crafted dirty electro conversion of the original production.
Bear in mind that this is a dub, and so the vocal is not heavily featured... however, it makes you go all fuzzy and warm inside when the vocal does kick in and there's plenty of stomping and head-bopping to be engaged in otherwise.

Don't forget to check out my previous two postings of other excellent Sebastien Leger remixes.



" Leger started out making bigroom house for Defected but over the years he's happily flitted been house, progressive, tech house, techno and electrohouse with 12"s for labels such as Hed Kandi, Pryda Friends, Intec and Pickadoll, as well as poppy rerubs of Justin Timberlake, Dave Gahan and Duran Duran.
