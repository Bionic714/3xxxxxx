And yet the are ""all the original NASA/JPL pictures"". 

umm - not any more?

Does anyone know of a set of planet wallpapers that really are the original pictures just cropped to appropriate resolution and only such other changes (if any) which are similarly a case of ""no option"" if you want a wallpaper?"
,mad_bunny,2007-12-24T15:58Z,"Uh...you obviously don't know the type of wallpaper I'm talking about.  But that's ok because you're clearly lazy and/or incompetent.  There's this thing called ""Google"" that has a image search.  If you want the raw photos, go there.  Or spend a couple weekends at APOD like I did. 

 In other words, do it yourself or don't whine like a baby when someone hands you something for free. 

 I haven't artsy-fartsy'ed these pics....All I've done is remove the digital artifacts....and added the NAME of the planet (which is what the astronomical symbol is) for clueless folks like you who wouldn't know things like, the sunset shot is on Mars or that Venus isn't actually blue.  If you don't like the Sun looking correct, get some software and swap the red for blue, because that's what color it was....blue."
[V],joshua13,2007-12-24T21:27Z,"Whine like a baby? LOL  I criticized your description which is clearly self contradictory and it is you who squeals like a stuck pig. Man up and admit you messed with the images quite a bit. I never said you made them artsy fartsy but I took clear issue with what you stated you did do. I took no issue with your statement that you cleaned them up because I both understood and approved.

the clueless folks are those who feel the need to clutter up beautiful images with names and such and can't understand why the astronomers would want a picture of the sun that's not in it's ""real"" colors nor can they see the beauty there  so they have to ""fix"" it. But that's the end of my attempts to argue by calling you stupid. I'll leave the rest of the ad hominum arguments to you, as you seem  fairly good at it.

It's free so I shouldn't complain? BS! If the the person handing out free samples at the grocery hands me rotten, contaminated food (Not making a  comparison to you or your work just an argument ad extremis) I have the desire and I think a right to complain - even perhps the public duty to warn others! Even free things come with some implied warranty, in common understanding. If you posted pictures of animals and called them pictures of mountains everyone would complain and righltly so. So lets have no more of that old saw ""it's free so you can't complain, take it or don't regardless of quality,etc"". We have a reasonable expectation not to have our time or bandwidth wasted.

For the record I could search out my own images, and make wallpapers. I do know how to do at least a basic job. But those of us who come here looking for good wallpaper cannot rightly be accused of sloth or incompetence on that account. Some of us may lack the skills, and we are all glad to save the time involved in creating it. Time saving is not laziness and not being a master of all trades does not make one incompetent in the pejorative sense in which you used it. No one know everything or is skilled at everything, that's no insult.

In a similar vein I could google about for planetary wallpapers, (not raw images which are plentiful) and find a bunch of torrents mostly without adequate description, download them and sift through them. But one of the values of living in a society is that not everyone needs to do everything for himself. That allows specialization and the creation of things that would otherwise never exist. Therefore I appealed to the community at TPB, if such can be said to exist, to share in their collective  wisdom and experience. This is neither lazy nor stupid, but wise and efficient. I admit this was largely rhetorical. I didn't really expect any answer. I know plenty of places where there are people more likely to be helpful than TPB.

just messing with your head and  I apologize, because I admit it was stupid of me. I promise not to do this again, ok? Nice pictures, really.
