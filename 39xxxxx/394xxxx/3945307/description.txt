Often, when people make wallpapers of the Planets, they clean up the photos and then add a bunch of artsy-fartsy, bullshit commentary or other graphics that ruin the picture.

Not this set.

This is a collection of cleaned up and enhanced shots of the Sun and the 8 planets?.two of Saturn?.plus a pot-shot at the new Dwarf Planet status of Pluto (it?s a joke I stole from ThinkGeek?.I like my version better)

The small graphic in the corner of each pic is the astronomical symbol for the planet featured in the picture.

The only false color image is of Venus?.although I had to go to town on the picture I had of the Sun because the original was ultra-violet.

These are not ?typical? beauty shots?.I altered the perspective on several of the pics just for the sake of sexing up the shot?..still, they are all the original NASA/JPL pictures.
