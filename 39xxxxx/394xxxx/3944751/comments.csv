,sweedishmetal,2008-01-04T01:25Z,"You're right, dude - these guys are awesome!  I picked up the CD not only for myself but got it for my buddy for Xmas.  I heard they have a video on MTV too.  Thanks Bro."

So fucking true.. I have discovered more awesome bands, and thereby eventually bought their albums and even clothes due to me becoming a total fanboy, than i ever would have if the internet didnt exist.. Then i'd just listen to the fucking radio for FREE, and be brainwashed into liking whatever they play."
