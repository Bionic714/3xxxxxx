,DrFarnsworth,2008-01-02T19:42Z,"ssintercept, only if your divx player supports HD divx files. If it's very new it might."
,Extreme124,2008-01-04T21:18Z,That KBPS Byterate looks nt in HD maby on your next release U could increase it to maby 1100Kbps and 1080i???
,dicktator,2008-01-10T12:33Z,"This movie is playable on PS3 with firmware 2.10 installed. 
However, since the PS3 can't play DivX files bigger than 2 Gb this movie stops at about 1 hour 19 min.

Other then that, great release with good quality, both picture and sound."
,FulciLives,2008-01-21T09:50Z,"I can confirm that the PS3 will not play past the 2GB mark. Should make files 1.99GB to be ""safe"" and if need be then split the movie into two files.

It will play and then stop when it gets to the 2GB spot of the file.

This 2GB limitation is for AVI fies. The PS3 will do MP4 up to 4GB in file size.

Please keep up the good work but limit the file size otherwise stop saying PS3 capable."
,FulciLives,2008-03-21T14:05Z,"Sony just announced firmware 2.20 for the Sony PS3 and one of the new features will be support of DivX files that are longer than 2GB although I assume 4GB will still be the limit for all media files.

This is great news. I will test and report back once 2.20 is out ... this is to happen within the ""next few days"" according to Sony."
