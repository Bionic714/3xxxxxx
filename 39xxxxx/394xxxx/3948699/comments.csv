,leshan,2007-12-29T05:06Z,"Kopwei, 
Is this the original?
Would you please give us the MD5 code?
Thank you."
,kopwei,2007-12-29T10:43Z,"That is not original, it is created by my laptop using Create Recovery Disc program in ThinkVantage. But it works well. 
MD5 code:

Start-up disc :  4F522F93271FFA476E996B92CDFE26AE

Operation System-Disc: 3C1C18B129348A2AA22A401216EAE614"

Thank you again."
,leshan,2007-12-29T19:13Z,"Sorry, One more question please. Is the RnR 4.1 original or you upgraded it and created the discs?"
,kopwei,2007-12-29T20:17Z,"The original recovery disc is RnR 4.0, after I download and upgrade RnR 4.1, the program recommended me to create a new recovery CD pack, and I did it. This is the recovery disc created by RnR 4.1"
,leshan,2007-12-30T23:28Z,"After the longtime recovery. Vista runs ok. But the one key recovery doesn't work. I find in Vista system there is no revovery and resure software. After installing the  RnR4.1 again. The one key recovery works.
Kopwei, Would you please release the origianl disks please?"
,kopwei,2008-01-03T00:34Z,"Sorry, I don't have 4.0 Recovery Disc and I don't know how to downgrade the 4.1 back to 4.0"
