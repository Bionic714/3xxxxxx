Any Means
Rome/Kids On Shred

From Quebec to Tahoe and back a few times, Any Means is the story of the Rome team progressing on snowboards, living in a communal house, chasing the snow, finding new spots, riding big shit, riding small shit, towing into whatever, camping out, filming with injuries, riding with Rome ams, and throwing a few parties. It???s the story about having fun together on snowboards. It???s a film about the collective addiction.

Riders: Bjorn Leines, Jesse Fox, Marius Otterstad, Jonaven Moore, Yan Dofin, Max Legendre, Casey Neefus, LNP, Marie-France Roy, Will Lavigne, and the rest of the AmArmy
