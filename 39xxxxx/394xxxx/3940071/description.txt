I have some good news for those of you who like me,want to use a MobilePre USB with XP x64.
I do a lot of experimenting with different OSs(Linux,OS X,Opensolaris) alongside and I usually dual or triple boot different versions of these systems. Well I just noticed that no matter what I did,XP x64 will not install the M-Audio drivers for this card_nothing new here,I know. Then last night,I dual booted with Xubuntu which required me to install madfudloader and to my great surprised as soon as I booted back into XP,the M-Audio card was instantly recognized and installed automatically!Same thing happens with Leopard,by the way;there are no official drivers but this is a workaround.
I backed up the drivers that I found in device manager since I believe that maybe they will work as well for someone with a standalone XP(or maybe even Vista x64?) install so they would not have to perform a dual boot Ubuntu install just to get this driver working. I havenÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t tested it on a standalone install but I see no reason why it should not work
