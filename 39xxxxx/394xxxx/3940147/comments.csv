,gm12345678,2008-02-06T05:15Z,"Bobonit, yes indeed, Symantec reports an infection of the keygen.  Interestingly, when I first obtained it, Symantec passed it with flying colors.  There's more discussion on this if you follow the link I posted to the full Echo Workstation torrent (from a different contributor).  I believe that this is a false positive -- if it isn't, then my own system is still infected, and it shows no such signs.

Anyway, here are a few serials generated from the keygen so you don't have to risk running it yourself:

BCW6F-QU6PL-Y3DLJ-JPH6T-C3PWJ
6GGSP-VSGRB-T6SRG-MHJWZ-UVN9F
XUEAM-PL8X3-3439P-UFPC6-2EFDB"
