For those of you unfamiliar with this addon, it merely adds "Universal Restore" functionality to an existing True Image Echo Workstation installation.  Attempts to use this particular release with any version of True Image other than True Image Echo Workstation 9.5 will probably fail.

Here's a torrent for the full, correct True Image program (minus this addon):

Cheers (I'm crossing my fingers since this is my first torrent creation).
