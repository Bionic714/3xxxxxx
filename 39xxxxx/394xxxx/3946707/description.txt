The script centers on a young woman with a long-term phobia of the bogeyman, who voluntarily
checks herself into a mental health facility with the hope of conquering her overwhelming
fears. However, much to her horror, she discovers that some things are terrifying on
purpose, and confronting her demons was not the best course of action.
