These are two videos shot with my photocamera on September 12, 2007 at a Joanna Newsom concert in Paradiso, Amsterdam. The resolution is 640x480, and I haven't recompressed them so they're quite large. These videos were previously available on YouTube:

I will only seed this until the requester has the files.
Enjoy
