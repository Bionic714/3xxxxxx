,pbuser12345,2008-08-15T00:52Z,this cd has been released 3 times the songs he has listed are ok! they are from the first release. If if you download this don't rename them! the are correct!
,Groundhogwhacka,2008-09-04T05:01Z,"Rugburn is correct. It is missing ""The Bartender Song"""
,BLooDSuGAR-LG,2008-09-20T11:26Z,so your saying i just need to rename a song right?
,DavidNC50,2008-09-28T00:16Z,"The original album song was Sittin at the bar.  The song ""The Bartender Song"" is just a re-release of the same song.  If you want to read more about it look here...

,msncs03,2008-10-18T00:29Z,"thanx for the album, needs to have rehab on it though"
,ubrmnsch,2009-06-12T07:54Z,"Just to clarify: This is the 2005 release. It does NOT include Bartender (Sittin' at a Bar). If someone could upload the 2008 version, that'd be spectacular. And man, I'd kill for a complete discography."
,insanetwiztidjuggalo,2010-12-29T14:35Z,Stop bitching people. I'm glad he uploaded this torrent! This mothefucker is hard to find now! Great Job arkguy72830. Ya'll are looking for the crappy re-release for that stupid Bartender song. I didn't actually think i'd be able to find the original version of the album. :D
