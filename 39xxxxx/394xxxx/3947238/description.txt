Christmas Day 2007



Odd..? Certainly not.  This is very special and one of the distinct highlights of my entire 2007 collection.  "Beautiful Strange" is much more apt a term for this conversion of an outstanding original.


Light some candles, and pour some wine...

I would like to point out that I have the utmost respect and adoration for any Rufus Wainwright production in it's original form and style.  Do not let my release schedule fool you; I am consistently in love with a great many different styles of music besides paying intricate attention to the the entire spectrum of electronic production.


For those who may be unaware, Supermayer is an established and respectable name in the fields of tech house / minimal techno, techno in general and sometimes what is termed ambient techno.  They are a collaboration of two artists, Superpitcher & Michael Mayer who are notable for their releases on the most distinguished Kompakt label.


In any case, this is Merry Christmas from themagicke, and it is with good will and season's tidings I present this beautiful music.


Happy holidays and God bless you all,



themagicke.




Enjoy and please seed.
