[T],JayRay,2008-12-10T18:52Z,"Ranjit12:

I reviewed the movie and found no AV problems (noise) during the wedding scene. I've checked comments on other sites where this torrent is posted and no one else has reported the problem either. They are all rave reviews. (there have been about 45,000 downloads of this torrent). If you have the time, you may want to re-download this file. You may have just a minor glitch in your original download. I'd like to see you get a good copy of this because it is excellent quality beginning to end, both sound and video.

Thanks:
JayRay"

[T],moviesbyrizzo,2011-11-28T17:37Z,"If youre looking for SUPREME picture quality with great sound too here is a bluray 1080p converted to standard divx picture size 720 X 404 - could just as easily make it an xvid for you if you insist

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6469544/The_Sound_of_Music_(1965)_2GB_DivX_from_1080p_(moviesbyrizzo)

it is 2hrs 54 minutes though rather than 2hrs 47 minutes s subtitles may be the only issue for you to consider

this is one that just is not the same if you get it from a dvd (especially dvd5) rather than bluray - even if you convert to dvd sized picture as we have for you as indicated

nice upload though Jayray - better picture than most similar ones we found"
,keithkerr,2011-12-06T18:50Z,Brilliant Musical ......... Thanks
,MongKP,2011-12-20T13:57Z,Thank you for your share. Download speed is really great.
,You_Muppet,2012-03-21T11:03Z,"What I don't get is why other uploaders -- and I'm talking about that stupid Rizzo guy -- go on other people's pages trying to 'sell' their torrents. ""For a far far superior offering""? What a tool. I wouldn't go that guy's page if I was paid to. What a muppet.

Thanks, JayRay, a great torrent."
