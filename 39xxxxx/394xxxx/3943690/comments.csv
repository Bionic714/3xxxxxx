Want some more?"
,ungern,2007-12-26T00:19Z,"Sure want some more! :)
Var tvungen att lägga upp Ibiza 6CD... Verkar ha fått massa nedladdningar här, synd på den om den inte hade fått överleva Demonoid. ;)"
,thebouncerxxx,2007-12-26T21:20Z,"Hej ""Ungern"" what do you want? Fick du min ""oldskool techno classics"" på demonoid?
Jag har också massor med ""orippat"" acid house."
,ungern,2008-01-09T22:55Z,"Haha :) tja, jag är nog mer för Ibiza-samlingen, än gamla aciden här, men visst hittade jag massa bra och kul låtar i denna samlingen med. Var aldrig med på demonoid, hittade Ibiza via btjunkie..."

,red456,2008-07-19T23:14Z,"i went through every track today, i'd give it a B-
decent enough, but no ""Spong"" or ""Dr Spanner"" tracks?!? that's inexcusable."

,panther1499,2010-03-08T20:03Z,Great upload thebouncerxxx. Really appreciate you taking the time and effort to make this available. I'm taking a nostalgic trip down memory lane with some of the classics here. Nice one mate:)
,annatar777,2010-05-11T16:22Z,"So you know - most of the albums are v2 rips. I believe one is at 192 [ still downloading for the moment ] 

Thebouncerxxx - The best thing to do is rip your cd's into flac, then transcode them into v0 rips using dbpoweramp. This is a safe conversion process, and will give you high quality rips. 

I also recommend a program called tag and rename to tag all your albums. Good to see some decent music on the public trackers for a change. :-)"
,allbymyself,2010-07-27T08:06Z,"in one of the folders there is a file named ""Yeah Buddy - Royal House 123bpm.mp3"" BUT it is acctually MAX COOPER - RIVER OF GOLD. and that tune is awesome! MAX COOPER FOR PRESIDENT"
