Rem: DVDFab Platinium filesize is below 6,5 MB incl. embedded valid Key in setup!
I didn\'t hack the registration part. You can alternative use, if you have obtain a genuine Key that one instead of the working shared one witch comes with it. Do not use shared Keys with other DVDFab exe cause the Keys are send by update check to them website include the IP and get blacklisted or be for sure a firewall block this program from internet access properly.
In difference to some other releaser\'s. I have nothing ripped nor Languages or other updates which are in every new build comes with.
