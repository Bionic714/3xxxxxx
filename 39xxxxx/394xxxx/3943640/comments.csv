The first person who did the transfer did it old-school and from what I can gather is not experienced in handling old tapes. He went right to work by putting the tapes in his deck and transferring to a standalone CD recorder. Various problems came up -- incorrect speed, nasty squealing, low volume levels, etc. Instead of taking corrective measures for such problems, he simply would run the tapes again, adjusting the pitch for speed, volume levels, and running multiple passes for each squeak. Also, he had azimuth adjustment on his deck, but apparently did not make correct use of it. 

What disturbs me most is the squealing. That kind of squealing is caused by oxide shedding, and each time you pass the tapes you lose more and more oxide. I am lucky there was any left over. 

When BonhamFan was gracious enough to let me transfer the tapes, the very first order of business was a good baking. This locked up the oxide for at least one pass, and that was all I needed. Also, I added the missing pressure pads - without those the tape pretty much ""floats"" above the heads instead of being pressed against them. I adjusted the azimuth real-time during the first ten seconds of playback. The key is to get the playback heads to read where the original recording deck wrote. 

Plus I transferred direct to 96kHz 24bit on my hard drive. That way if there were any problems, I could correct them digitally and not run the tapes over and over."

,TimD54,2008-01-22T21:23Z,"Besides, this *IS* the show with the baked tapes and the azimuth adjustment - you didn't read my notes, did you?"
,Yesmaniac,2008-01-26T01:03Z,"I must agree. Presence has facilitated the release and circulation of some fantastic stuff that other trackers won't touch, but the world doesn't begin and end with the guy."
,TimD54,2008-01-26T09:08Z,"Presence hasn't always been in the past what he purports to be now.  I don't touch any of his stuff, and I tell anyone else who does, caveat emptor.    Good luck with RO."
,professorvalley,2008-01-28T04:33Z,"oops your an idiot now.  did you read the notes I posted?  this isnt the baked tapes version, and is the incorrect azimuth version.  good job spreading around the crap."
,TimD54,2008-01-28T08:48Z,"Lots of talk from a leech.  I notice you've not uploaded a single torrent in your entire membership.  If you have something better, then supercede my show.  If not, STFU."
,professorvalley,2008-01-29T03:21Z,"can't be a leech when i haven't grabbed any of your crap.  keep spreading it around tho, it's good for the community in your eyes."
