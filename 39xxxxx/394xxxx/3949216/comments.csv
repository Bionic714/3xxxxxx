Season 1 was a total of 13 episodes, and if you want good quality, they need to be AT LEAST 175MB each.  However when I do the math 175MBx13 does not equal 652MB.   It actually equals about 2.2GB, so with that aspect you can see that this is either fake, or very bad quality, with each episode at approx. 50MB each.
If you want quality rips, look for 175MB per 20-30 minutes of video.  Not 50MB each.  Sorry to those of you who are already downloading, or have already finished :-/"

,westjgames,2011-01-01T13:25Z,"Its about time someone actually made torrents specifically targeted at those with low bandwidths, or haven't the time to dl 24/7. In australia, where you get a thimble to piss in compared to amercian quotas, this is very welcome, Keep it up, killerdemon."

,baileythebat,2012-05-07T05:17Z,"Just downloaded this in about 30mins despite the low seeder count.  I'll be seeding this and all your other Simpsons torrents once they finish.  The quality, even on my 40 inch monitor looks perfectly fine!"
,CJClags,2012-07-14T19:49Z,"Unfortunately, shadows retarded post is at the top of this page. The lesson in resolution and mathematics was appreciated but you are a complete douchbag.
You are correct, however, nobody fucking asked. This is a legitimate good-enough quality upload and hopefully nobody disregards this as fake or poor quality.

Thanks to the seeders, props to killer"
