This is a lovely vid, probably the best MM I have seen on TPB.  It's great to see two guys really enjoying themselves, it looks really genuine and natural.  Lots of passionate kissing and sucking makes up half the clip, which might be a bit soft for some, but I thought it was great. :D

Just a few specs:  640x480res WMV, 16bit stereo audio @44KHz which sometimes loses sync a bit, but it's not too bad.  Domain banner overlaid in LR, but it's mentally blockable :)"

I never had heard of this threeset! I'm downloading all three, but it seems that the third one hasn't seeds...

Best regards
