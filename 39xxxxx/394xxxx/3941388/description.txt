these files are in Apple Lossless. if you're not into that, convert them as you please after you get them.

i got the files, almost all of them, from dionomeD back in the day. they did once upon a time have lovely things like md5's and log files but those didn't last, so my apologies. however, i have personally checked a hell of a lot of files' spectrums and they run the full range. try for yourself if you want to be sure.
