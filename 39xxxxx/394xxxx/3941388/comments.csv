,nympholept,2007-12-28T06:53Z,"I would like to compare these files to the one's i already have to check the quality, but nothing i've tried will decode these files.
winamp, foobar, xilisoft audio converter, trader's little helper

Any idea what i can use, or any chance in sharing these in a better format?"
