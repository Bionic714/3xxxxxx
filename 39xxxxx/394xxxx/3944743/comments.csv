,jokeri1971,2007-12-23T07:23Z,it works but i just find out that some keys are for the year 2007 so if the key does not work try a other key
,uren1,2007-12-23T09:36Z,It seems to be some trap of some piracy site or seeder crashed out on 95.1% because everyone is on that thats like 10+ people
,Hypnosis4U2NV,2007-12-23T21:59Z,"112.95MB? WTF?

This isnt a normal Eset program size.."
,uren1,2007-12-24T00:08Z,its business program for massive networks what do think its going to be like 20mb for some network with 1000 users lol.
,jokeri1971,2007-12-24T06:27Z,i put the 32 % 64 bit version on it also the remote control and addon generator normal its about 20 to 25 mb yes but look at the files

,milelc,2007-12-28T16:30Z,Key is a blacklist
,maze581,2008-01-05T04:18Z,nice :)
,overklocked,2008-01-20T01:19Z,"Keys doesnt works. 

ThRiLl_SeAkEr, all keys there were blacklisted to. :("
,Karmst,2008-01-20T08:37Z,When trying to use the Eset Admin Server it is asking for a *.LIC file. Is that included in this torrent or is there a way to make one?
,aSToViRuS,2008-01-21T14:25Z,"""112.95MB? WTF?""

Another reason for this torrent to be SO big, is that the releaser has put compressed(rar) and uncompressed versions of the same files (why, mate? Else it would be just 57MB!). They are passworded, but pass is also included...

Anyway, using this torrent and user/pass from old good www.nod321.com does the trick so......
THANKS!"
