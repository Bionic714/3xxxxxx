an el pumpkino magnifico production


This is a completely bogus collection. There is nothing on here that is
different in any way from anything else, and no doubt if you ask the
Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½expertsÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½, it\'s a complete waste of time.

That said, this stellar collection accumulates all the myriad mixes
from the Beatles\' released output that appear nowhere else, except in
the sources shown in the track listing. Those marked with a * are only
rumored to be different mixes, none of the so-called authorities would
agree. Nevertheless, they have circulated as such in collector\'s circles.

This set is meant to compliment other, more easily available
collections, and so includes nothing otherwise available from:

The official EMI CD catalog
The Purple Chick Deluxe Series
Dr Ebbetts remasters (et al) for the original US & UK releases (both
mono & stereo)
Any officially released DVD, including the Beatles\' films & Anthology
Director\'s Cut.

So if you have all those, you still don\'t have these.

Thanks to Joe Brennan for his excellent analysis of recording variants
Special thanks to H.B. & D.L. for some hard-to-find tracks
