On a sultry summer day in 1935, an upper-class British family 
prepares for a dinner party at their country estate. The players: 
Briony Tallis ( Saoirse Ronan), a precocious preteen writer; 
her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley), Cambridge graduate 
and femme fatale; Robbie Turner (James McEvoy), the housekeepers 
mensch-y son, who carries a torch for Cecilia; and various visitors 
and family members. A series of misperceptions, fueled by the summer 
heat and Briony's childish hurts and fevered imagination, lead to a 
dramatic false accusation that lands Robbie in jail. We meet all three 
characters five years later in the thick of World War II, as foot soldier 
Robbie prepares for the Dunkirk evacuation and the two estranged sisters 
train as nurses in London.


Cast: Keira Knightley, James McAvoy, Brenda Blethyn, Saoirse Ronan.
