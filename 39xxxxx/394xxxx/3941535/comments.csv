,pyronoid,2007-12-21T06:49Z,well....We need a crack for this patch now!! :S
,snek,2007-12-21T08:06Z,"There is NO crack for the Witcher you nubs.. Just mount on a virtual IDE drive using DaemonTools PRO..

Get your facts straight before you start whining.."
,dae.edorian,2007-12-21T19:32Z,Can anyone confirm that the DTools Pro/IDE method still works after this patch is installed?
,TaNaa,2007-12-23T08:16Z,"snek, hey! 
There is no need to be so rude. After all, you are the one who's wrong.
Waiting for the patch now.
P.S. You can get this patch so much faster from the official witcher web site. :)"
,TaNaa,2007-12-23T08:17Z,waiting for the crack*
,MiX_08,2007-12-23T18:06Z,"The Daemon Tools Pro method still works, although I had to update my SPTD for it to work. 
You can find the updated ones here;

,Zek-Foo,2007-12-26T16:21Z,what is sptd if i mayy ask :D
,insejn,2007-12-27T04:38Z,"Since the IDE-mounting isn't available for 64-bit XP, how exactly do you run it on a 64-bit system?"
,Huntarr,2007-12-29T00:34Z,"Snek before you start calling everyone noobs, why don't you explain how this get's used without a crack?  Since everyone can get this patch off the site faster than this torrent."
,tynor,2008-01-04T08:53Z,"im not sure what's wrong with my game, but i installed it, cracked it and played (not with this version), and i can only start the first battle, then after i finish it, the old man asked if im ok and freezes, but the world keep going, but he doesn't continue talking, is that a known glitch?"
,qzcvb,2008-01-16T12:49Z,"Snek! Congrats! You have been chosen as one of the eligible contestants of TPB dummies of 2007.
Good job of being ironic Snek. Noob? Sneer....

Btw, its a much faster download if you get it from Fileshack. 
Why bother using a virtual drive that would just eat up space ? 
There are NO-CD patches or cracks so that it's more convenient for everyone.

,Kick-On-Foo,2008-02-02T13:25Z,"Hey I need some help!
if played the game for some time with the old patch, and now a have got my hands on the new 1.2 and the game is working perfect with the russian crack, but all my old saves are lost... I still have a folder with my saved games, but in the game there are none when I press load game in the menu...

Help PLZ.... I dont want to start all over!!!"
,furtherdown,2008-03-19T17:19Z,You have to move your old saved games folder to the new location.  Or buy the game and that will fix all the problems you're having.

THERE IS NO NEED TO INSTALL DAEMONS TOOLS TO PLAY THE WITCHER TO GET AROUND THE TAGES PROTECTION SYSTEM.

The story goes like this I've played about a quarter of the way through The Witcher on an older computer using Daemon Tools Advanced and decided it was time to get a more powerful games system. 

The problem was my new computer (probably the OEM installed drivers) refuses to play with the latest DTA. My system hangs when it is installed (the STPD problem) and I can't even get to the desktop unless I uninstall DTA in safemode.

Woe me ...woe me I will never get to finish the Witcher. Damn, and it was good too. I tried everything to try and get DTA to work but to no avail (and I know my situation is not unique- just google Daemon tools+system hangs, among other problems). Soon the Witcher was becoming a distant memory...a happy memory.

That was until I updated my copy of UltraISO to ""UltraISO Premium Edition version 9.3.0.2600"". I know for a fact that my older 9.1 version could not play it in its one virtual drive (I think it was more designed for playing DVD.iso's than getting around games protections).

I was able to install The Witcher to my hard drive (load the .iso into the virtual drive and press the magnifying glass symbol by the side to autoplay The Witcher.iso). I then updated it to v1.2 patch and replaced the witcher.exe with a no-cd crack.  

I have no idea why it was able to work as UltraISO is not a dedicated games .iso emulator like DTA. BUT IT WORKS...DAMN IT...IT WORKS.

No more DTA for me. In contrast UltraISO is non-invasive on your system and I've had no incompatibility problems or issues with it at all.

NOTE: I'm not sure if Witcher.mdf format works with this program so play it safe and use a rip that is a Witcher.iso. I downloaded this copy of UltraISO with a serial no. You can get it anywhere on the web: most torrents. 

I won't divulge the exact site simply because there are some silly fuckers out there who think it's a great idea to start forum threads with good sites names posted all over it. Over exposing good non-torrent sites and getting them shut down in the process. 

Hail me for I am the new King...long live the KING...long live the King!.

BTW I got my version of The Witcher from

I will spam the other Witcher torrents here to spread the good news."
,fungalinguistic,2011-06-24T03:13Z,"i downloaded the patch from the witcher 2 website, but as soon as I tried to install it it shut the autopatcher off and told me that my game version is invalid or incomplete, does this one have that problem? if so, how do I avoid it?"
