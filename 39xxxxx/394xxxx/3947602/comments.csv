,SysGhost,2008-06-14T22:31Z,"Seems a large file size scares off most people, too bad.
I'll hope I can get this one down. Once I've done that I'll put on a large seed ammount on it and hope more will do the same."

,WoWx3,2011-09-08T18:01Z,"I have turned initial seeding on in uTorrent for this torrent. Thank you to the moderator for turning this on :)

I'm on a 100/100mbit connection with 12/12mb/s output (100%). I will help you seed this, you will soon experience a speed increase, that is me seeding back to you :)

However, as it slows down my computer a bit i cannot keep that speed continously. So any help seeding this torrent will be highly appreciated, not only be me, but others like YOU who want to download it quickly as possible.

over'n'out"
,WoWx3,2011-09-11T05:23Z,"Just so you foreigners don't freak on me. I'm uploading from Sweden (Suede). Speed suffers if the distance is very far between us.

Best advice i can give to speed up your download is.. >"
,WoWx3,2011-09-11T05:32Z,"[DOWNLOAD FASTER] What I'm about to say now is nothing but true facts, read if you want to finish the download fastest possible!

[LEECHERS] If you upload fast(er), more peers will finish faster which in return gives ALOT faster download for you :)

[SEEDERS] The more data you finish, the faster your download will be. Your client will download from more peers as they finish thier download. All torrents begin slow, se be patience. 

[CONCLUSION] The faster upload, the faster you download. This is the golden rule, and will always be with torrents.

[FINAL WORDS] Think about it, it's logic. And it's truth. So don't whine on slow speed, start seed!

Spread the knowledge. No need to post a thank you to me, rather send your thank's to Ubehage. Without Ubehage's in the world, world would be quite empty place!"
