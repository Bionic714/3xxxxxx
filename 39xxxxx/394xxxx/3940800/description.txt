Short bio:

It's not every day that three people from different parts of the world meet and immediately decide to form a band, but if you're talking about New Zealand based band ATLAS, that's exactly what happened.

In April 2005, at the famous Knitting Factory in Los Angeles, New Zealand rocker Ben Campbell and his sister Beth Campbell were introduced to American solo artist Sean Cunningham. The three were introduced by producer Hank Linderman in hopes that they would combine their talents to write songs for their seperate solo careers. Five days later the group decided to form ATLAS.

Also in L.A. at the time playing with the legendary Sting was Ben's former bandmate and future ATLAS lead guitarist Andy Lynch. Now relocated in Auckland, New Zealand, ATLAS have proven their worth with their gripping first single "Is This Real" topping the rock radio charts. Written by Ben and Sean, the song is a gritty, honest account of finding yourself. "It???s a song about growing up, about not having a real structure in life," Ben explains, "looking for reasons to get up and do things." The track, which has brought the band much attention in the music industry, was recorded in Christchurch by Elements Music and mixed at Neil Finn???s studio in Auckland.

Now with a hit single under their belts, ATLAS are releasing their second song "Crawl" to radio and TV. "For me 'Crawl' is about not wanting to conform to the majority, and wanting to figure life out for yourself" say's Sean. "It's also a song which has helped to define us sonically, finding where our sound sits". The group have been working hard on that sound, combining their varying tastes in music to come up with their unique rock sound.
