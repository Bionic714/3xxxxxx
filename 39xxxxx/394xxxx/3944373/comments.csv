Can anybody give me full instructions on how to
do it successfully?
Thanks."
,snakelad,2008-05-21T03:19Z,"To the person who uploaded this file can you
please upload a new copy? I tried downloading it
using 3 different torrent software but it won't
download. Better if you can use Microsoft Word
to make it easier to open or read.
Thanks."

I found this deadly eBay shop that does the Real, physical finbarr books, brand New and at no cost compared to the high street and other sites.
