A televised poker cash game in which top pros including Sam Farha, Doyle Brunson, and Johnny Chan compete. This is not a tournament however, each player is playing with their own money and they have the option to buy in again.
Last episodes have $500 000 minimum buyin and there is over $5 millon on table.
Enjoy!
