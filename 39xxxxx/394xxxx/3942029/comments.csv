tips for uploading....
name the torrent something like maybe what it is.  because mmbgpd means absolutely nothing.  Also don't compress your files.  RARing or ZIPing looks suspicious like you're hiding something in there.  Plus no one can see what's really in there or possibly choose specific files.
add txt files for info on the contents. i.e. tracks, names, bit rate, format, etc.
for starters....

thank you, i suppose "
