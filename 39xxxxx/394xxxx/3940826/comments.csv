,donraju,2007-12-22T04:02Z,"is this 25 or 29.97 fps??? could u pls also upload chang cheh's vengeance, boxer from shantung, one armed swordsman trilogy???"
,mistertpitydafoo,2007-12-25T09:56Z,"I am pretty certain it is the films original fps which is below 25 fps. According to the subtitle creator (subrip) its 23.976 fps. I'm pretty certain it's the same on the divx since it's supposed to autodetect the fps the original runs at and do the same, according to the settings I selected in it's options section. Unfortunately I don't think I have Vengeance yet on DVD. Boxer from Shantung the same thing. I honestly haven't even watched it yet, I have about 50 shaw flicks on the pc still that I haven't watched and numerous others I have. Those are from JamesKees efforts of upping .rmvb files. Although I do have it in .rmvb format. I could upload the .rmvb format one if you want but it isn't nearly as high quality as the dvd rips. I do have one armed swordsman dvd and I know today for Christmas ""The New One Armed Swordsman"" is amongst the gifts so after today I can upload those two. I am trying to recall if I have Return of the One Armed Swordsman on dvd. I will check for you. I have plenty of more movies coming along plus pretty much every venom movie and movie that features more than one venom (I know there is plenty of extra movies that feature at least one, but I feel these 15 or so that have at least 2 venoms in them are considered the core venom films)."
