M.R. James is one of the greatest writers of stories of the supernatural, and 'Oh Whistle And I'll Come To You, My Lad' is one of his darkest works - a tale of solitude and terror, and the dangers of intellectual pride.

Made in 1968 for BBC Television's Omnibus programme, Jonathan Miller's adaptation succeeds in capturing the chill of terror at the heart of the story. The bleak Norfolk landscape is superbly photographed by Dick Bush to instill a sense of isolation and unease from the outset, and Michael Hordern's performance as the eccentric, grouchy professor is nothing short of brilliant.

The final scenes willl leave you with a shiver of horror you will not easily shake off...
