,stupidcorn,2008-01-28T08:25Z,128k is never lossless.
,Dutch_Browser,2008-03-01T10:39Z,"I agree with stupidcorn, and 128kbps sux"
,Crazy Bastard,2008-04-06T17:28Z,"if you agree, just convert the damn thing to 320 kbps -.-"
,Crazy Bastard,2008-04-06T21:56Z,forget about converting... the quality on this is very bad. it is fucked up with errors in every song!
,faggotron,2008-04-16T04:14Z,"talk about crazy bastards. i've so got this mo'fo playin' in itunes and i don't notice any errors. i also would not convert it to 320, should you be concerned about the quality. accept it as it is and be thankful it really doesn't have any fuckin' errors. it could be clicking and beeping and booping and the tracks could be 23 minutes long each, 20 minutes of that dedicated to pure silence (or was that a secret boards of canada remix? we may never know!) and whatever the hell else could be wrong with it. ITS NO FLAC, MY LIFE IS OVER! :("
,faggotron,2008-04-16T04:18Z,"p.s. IT IS .m4a, not .mp3. "
