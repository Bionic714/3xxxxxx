note: this can be played on your pc through vlc media player and a spdif connection from your pc to your dts reciever."
,chrizzzter,2008-01-17T13:46Z,"If you have your computer hook'ed up with a THX sorround system, like I have, and you're hearing static, download and install this filter. It will decode DTS-audio in your player of choice. (for me, it will be Windows Media Player and Media Player Classic)

,vidarsmith,2008-05-23T22:09Z,"Hi, I have to agree with ""mdurao"" in some point.
1: Is this dts from original ""tape"" or someone done it with a conversione application at home with there 
home computer.
2: If the dts is made from the origin of the master ""tape"" this is a very audioable masterpiece.
Check out the real ones: Jean micheal jarre, allan parson project, studio elga, tangerime dream, etc........."
,vidarsmith,2008-05-31T01:03Z,"Thank you. For the effort you may have occured during the process of all those files.
My question is simply: What to do with the *.wav files.
Many or let say minoriti uploaders, have allways made this kind of music in a *.iso format.
Now I donÂ´t know what to do whith it.
Please help me..
