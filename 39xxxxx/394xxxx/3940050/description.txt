Pawas - Playtex (Daso Remix 2007) [Tech House / Minimal Techno]



I mentioned this absolutely beautiful production in my previous posting of SCSI-9's "Kroy Menya V Pol Bita" on the 'Fear Of Flying' label.  Plucked from Pawas' "Playtex EP" on the same label, here is an essential Daso remix for your listening and dancing pleasure...

We shall certainly get onto a bit of Pawas a little later in the schedule, who is a producer in the field of tech / minimal I am paying lots of attention to.  His remix of SCSI-9's "Kroy Menya V Pol Bita" (on the schedule) continues to work wonders for me.

Daso has stolen the show with this particular production though... it's quite simply outstanding and I am completely addicted to it.

Any persons new to or curious about the field of tech house and minimal techno are strongly urged to give this smooth and seductive treat a try.


" integrator "... I just saw your comment on Mininova.  I'm ever so pleased that you have found you way back to the schedule since Demonoid has been on the blink, and of course you are most welcome my friend.  Let's hope the little green fiend gets up and running again in the new year!



Enjoy and please seed.
