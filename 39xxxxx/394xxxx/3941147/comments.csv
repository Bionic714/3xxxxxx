He does not post torrents to promote any party, denomination or religious system. He simply believes in Jesus, and as to being a wingnut: Those can come in handy when screws come unloose..

When it comes to belief, eather you believe in evolution or in creation or maybe a mix of these philosophies."
,FSmonster,2009-04-20T08:12Z,"A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not ""guesses"" but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than ""just a theory."" It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress.

But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact."
[T],verifire,2009-05-15T12:18Z,"Well.. Personally I like to distinguish between ""evolution"" and ""adaptation"". ""Evolution"" is, as we all know, related to Darwin's ""About The Origin of Species"", and even though Darwin didn't, the ""believers"" mostly rule out that there is a Creator behind what we perceive as the real, living world. Darwin himself, by the way, stressed the fact that this was just a theory, based upon the variety in the species he saw on the Galapagos Islands, and later recanted the whole thing. Adaptations doesn't take billions of years. The animals (and human beings also) can adapt to changes in living conditions very fast, and I'm talking one, two or three generations in some cases.
Funny how we all are thought the theory to be ""proven fact"". But try watching this upload before you make any further ""comments"" upon it, please.

Well, back to the point: ""Adaptation"", on the other hand, does not at all exclude a Creator from the process.

The real issue here isn't whether creatures and men evolve or adapt, but rather whether life just ""happened"", in all it's diversity and genius, all by itself, or if life was made and set into emotion and reproduction by a Creator.

My opinion (and because of the massive propaganda AGAINST a creator I belong to a minority) is based on thoroughly looking at the different evidence for this and the other, and what I found is that to believe that life ""just happened"", really is incredibly.. well, ignorant. Sorry to say so, but you don't have to be stupid just because someone told you theories are facts and made you believe it is true.

And I don't see myself as ""intellectual"". I just have have the liberty to check out the evidence from both sides before I draw a conclusion, and so have you. I find that to be a good idea.. So, again, watch the series before posting any more God-less nonsense disguised as ""scientific facts"". You might in fact be astonished by what you find.. Thank you for bearing with me. :-)"

Thank you for repeating the lie of the creationists. It reminds me of when I discovered I had been lied to about a number of things by my church. Oh, and for the record, adaption is one of many aspects of evolution. Try reading a book that accurately presents evolution and you'll find other lies creationists have fed you.

""Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking  nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn.  The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.  If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learned from experience and the light of reason?

Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books.  For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although ?they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertions?.[1 Timothy 1.7]""

You think I go to one of he so called ""churches""? NO. I believe in one Church only, and it's the one that actually are limbs on the Body of Christ.
Why on earth would you want to dismiss The Creators work and Creationism (I really, really hate that word, by the way. Too many crazy people have used it to present idiotic and dogmatic nonsense.. Some mix it up with a little stand-up, and are ever sooo popular..), well why throw the baby out with the bathwater? Come on.. Please..? Watch it or don't, but don't blame Jesus or me or for that matter W. Veight for what those people did to you. Jesus would never have lied to you, and you know that.

You're at war, my friend, whether you and I like it or not, and there's no neutral ground. You might catch a break now and then, but generally it's a war for yours and my immortal soul. Where do we want to spend eternity? That's what all these -ism are trying to get you to choose your path by.

""He who wants to be My disciple, must everyday pick up his (or her) cross and follow ME!"" That's the only path I see that amounts to anything, the only thing that's real..

[T],verifire,2009-09-06T18:30Z,"Oh, and for the record: I do believe in evolution and adaption inside the different species. I just believe, based upon logical reasoning around for instance the ""Evolution"" of the Bombardier beetle, that it's impossible to ""Evolve"" in such a manner.

And please don't take this personally, my friend ""Jonny645"", it's just to be more precise and show that I'm not really grasping for straws here.

Now it's my turn to quote, and I do this only to show just a mere fraction of a decimal of a percent of what Evolutionists wants us to believe has evolved, all by itself.. The following is a description of the defense mechanism of the Bombardier beetle:

Bombardier Beetles are ground beetles (Carabidae) - more than 500 species altogether - that are most notable for the defense mechanism that gives them their name: When disturbed, the beetle ejects a noxious chemical spray in a rapid burst of pulses from special glands in its abdomen. The ejection is accompanied with a popping sound.

A Bombardier beetle produces and stores two reactant chemical compounds, hydroquinone and hydrogen-peroxide in separate reservoirs in the rear tip of its abdomen. When threatened, the beetle contracts muscles that force the two reactants through valved tubes into a mixing chamber containing water and a mixture of catalytic enzymes. When combined, the reactants undergo a violent exothermic chemical reaction raising the temperature to near the boiling point of water. The corresponding pressure buildup forces the entrance valves from the reactant storage chambers to close thus protecting the beetles internal organs. The boiling, foul-smelling liquid partially becomes a gas (flash evaporation) and is expelled through an outlet valve into the atmosphere with a loud popping sound. The flow of reactants into the reaction chamber and subsequent ejection to the atmosphere occurs cyclically at a rate of about 500 times per second and with the total pulsation period lasting for only a fraction of a second.

The gland openings of some African bombardier beetles can swivel through 270째 and thrust between the insect's legs so it can be discharged in all sorts of directions with considerable accuracy.

Secretory cells produce hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide which collect in a reservoir. The reservoir opens through a muscle-controlled valve onto a thick-walled reaction chamber. This chamber is lined with cells that secrete catalases and peroxidases. When the contents of the reservoir are forced into the reaction chamber, the catalases and peroxidases rapidly break down the hydrogen peroxide and catalyze the oxidation of the hydroquinones into p-quinones.

These reactions release free oxygen and generate enough heat to bring the mixture to the boiling point and vaporize about a fifth of it. Under pressure of the released gasses the valve is forced closed, and the chemicals are expelled explosively through openings at the tip of the abdomen. Each time it does this it shoots about 70 times very rapidly. The damage caused can be fatal to attacking insects and small creatures and is painful to human skin.

Evolution of the defense mechanism.

The defense mechanism uses features that are common in other beetles and have evolved as variations subjected to natural selection. Various quinones are commonly produced by cells in the skin of insects to harden their skin into a cuticle, and as they taste bad to predators, many insects secrete them to deter predators. Where there are indentations in the cuticle, these vary to form little sacs that store the deterrent quinone. Where predators develop resistance to this chemical, other related chemicals such as hydroquinone develop, and in many beetles specialized cells secreting hydroquinone form glands connected by ducts to a reservoir sac, which can be closed off by muscles to stop leakage. While all carabid beetles have this sort of arrangement, in some cases Hydrogen peroxide, which is a common by-product of the metabolism of cells, is mixed in with the hydroquinone, and some of the catalases that exist in most c"
