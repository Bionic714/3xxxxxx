Hi there..

I have, on requests, started to seed this again. I promise not to stop seeding as long as there are takers, but if the moment comes when there's none, I take it off my seed-machine, permanently, because:

You will find the first four parts here:

Originally there were six parts, but I found that the last two were added to these four, and have little to do with Creationism.

Number five was archeology, about the Exodus and Egypt, and quite interesting, so I made it into one separate torrent here:

Lesson six was about how important Dr. Veith feels the Sabbath is, since he is Adventist by denomination, and I didn't feel that had nothing to do with the heart of the matter, so I removed it.

Because the Bible says that one person regards one day as holier than the other days of the week, and another person regards ALL days as equally holy and sanctified by and for God. That's a quote from Paul, the Apostle, in the New Testament..

I do not promote anything else than what I feel to be both true and right and important, and certainly I don't promote any other congregation than the One and only true Church: Those who have been born again by The Holy Spirit, and have entered into the New Covenant with the Lord and man's Saviour, Jesus Christ of Nazareth. I pray my name is, and will remain, written into the only book of any importance in the end; The Book Of Life..

For those interested, a full list of uploads I have made can be found here:

And it's still an excellent series for the logical mind. Dr Walther J. Veight gives four lectures on the origin of the species.
And one on some interesting archeology in Egypt.
Then there's this (sixth) part about the sabbath.

But, regardless of Dr. Veight's denomination, he knows what he's talking about when it comes down to Science and Archeology. If you still believe Darwin was right after seeing these, then you probably also believe that the World Trade Center was brought down by two passenger jets crashing into them, and that Jesus is dead.. But He isn't. And He loves you. And that's a fact.. :-)
