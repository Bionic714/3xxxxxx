Also included in this torrent is cover from the UK PAL region 2 version. I couldn't find a high-res NTSC 5-disc wide-spline cover so I used this one, but the isos are in fact NTSC & Region free."
,julets,2007-12-22T13:26Z,"Big thanks for your kind effort, enigma907! ;) This looks like a massive collective document. Looking forward to exploit it!

,gabby1976,2007-12-23T19:19Z,will it really take that long to load?
,enigma907,2007-12-23T19:46Z,"it will be slow until availability hits 2.0 ... I can only u/l ~40 kb/sec.  My guess is around jan 1st it'll all be up, then after that it'll be normal speed as long as as other seeds stick around."
,voyeurman,2007-12-25T05:53Z,Pls SEED! As everybodys stuck at 13.7%!!!!
,enigma907,2007-12-28T09:27Z,"Okay I'm a retard.  This is the first torrent I've ever started so you'll have to forgive me.  I just figured out why I've uploaded 17GB but you guys are only around 25% instead of 75%... I hadn't checked the ""initial seed"" option.  I just changed this so hopefully this will speed things up quite a bit."
,LazyD,2007-12-31T03:02Z,"Thanks for this, all nice in iso's and everything, hope it all downloads ok and works and everything."
,Fruside,2008-01-01T20:21Z,"seed please!
We're a huge number that are stuck at 30%..

can any one seed?? "

,Ozmantx,2008-01-03T02:39Z,"Who is the narrator for this particular Series.. is it Sigourney Weaver or David Attenborough??? US finally released a set with each of the two doing it and wondering who is narrating.

 Great up, thanks."
,Ozmantx,2008-01-03T02:41Z,Nevermind..   I guess this is the new release then.

thanks!"

,chosenpirate,2008-01-09T14:10Z,"Seeding ethics: Do you want this file?

then seed it. I am at a university line, i seed high-velocity speeds (500kb/s - 1.3MB). Availability of this type of huge torrent depends on everyone seeding. Yesterday i had download speed up to 400kb/s, now i have 0.8kb/s. still 700 upload.

Come on guys, it takes the fucking piss being a leech on this type of file. Give back to those who makes it possible for you to download it.

Thanks"
,Tossrock,2008-01-09T23:17Z,If I ever manage to download this beast I'll definitely be seeding it until I see the number of seeds go up.

I am downloading and I am not seeing the seeder. I am seeing hundreds of leechers though. Anyone know what's going on? I know enigma07 is super-seeding."
,VictorTheGreat,2008-01-15T01:38Z,Why is there so many leechers and only one Seeder?

Anybody finished.
Please Seed 
Thanks in advance"
,ocky1,2008-01-17T02:45Z,please seed until a few of us have complete downloads
,VictorTheGreat,2008-01-17T16:05Z,"enigma907, are you still there? I hate when that happens: everybody stuck on 84%. What's wrong with you people. SEED, please!!!"

Everybody Seed!!!  : )
Thanks Enigma907"
,Master550,2008-01-18T22:39Z,"Don't know how long this will take. I am stuck at 90%. Seems the present seeders have all their upload slots filled; every time I notice that someone is about to hit the magic 100% they drop off my list. :(

Even if half of the leechers stay and continue to seed that would be great.

It is nice we have 3 seeders now though. Took long enough."
,VictorTheGreat,2008-01-19T04:17Z,"Sorry but I still havent figured out how that thing works.
Do I upload while I am downloading this file?
How do I became a seeder? Do I have to wait until i get to 100% of the file?
Has anyone actually finished downloading this?
I've been trying for a week now. Still on 37.5%.
Hope I can see the episodes in the end."
,enigma907,2008-01-19T09:25Z,"It's finally almost done, at 97% so I expect when I wake up tomorrow it'll be done.

To TonyDanza: I am on an inexpensive DSL connection, i can't go faster than 40 kb/sec, even for one night.  I really thought I could get it up in a week tho, or I wouldn't have even tried.

To Ozmantx: This is the BBC David Attenborough version, as stated in the description, not the Discovery Channel Sigourney Weaver version.

To Victor: Nobody has downloaded it all... yet... by the time I wake up tomorrow, everyone who has been patiently waiting (a fuckin month!) will have it, and it'll be fast for everyone else as long as others seed.  With most torrent programs, you will automatically seed once you have it all, so just don't remove it from your torrent program, and it'll help everyone else out. 

To everyone else: This took way longer than I expected.  I'm at a ratio of 3.4, I've uploaded 78 Gb for a torrent thats only 21gb... I thought torrents were more effeicient than this, it woulda been up in one week (not 4) if I only had to upload it once.  I dunno enough about torrents to understand why, but I know this much, I'm not gunna start a new torrent of this size again (w/o a faster connection) cuz it woudla been faster to download the dvd9 version and compres it yourself (like I did) than to get this from the beginning.  However now that its all (almost) up, it'll be fast as long as others besides me keep seeding.   Once this is done, I'm gunna start downloading again (it's been a fuqn month) which will slow my upload, but I expect (hope) others will be seeding and it'll be super fast.    

This was a learning experience for me, sorry to all those who had to wait WAY TOO LONG to get this, and hopefully you guys help others out by seeding so they can get it quick. 

Cheers."
,Simpl,2008-01-19T10:34Z,"Thank you, enigma907.   We appreciate the up!"
,VictorTheGreat,2008-01-19T14:42Z,"To enigma907: Thank you very much.
After 7 days(with some interruption) I am on 50% now. I hope things get faster later. I am not that bothered about the time spending downloading, I just want to know if it will work after all.
Once more, thanks for the up and the help."
,Master550,2008-01-19T17:00Z,"enigma,
I think it has been a learning experience for us all but it's nice to see four seeders on now. As we get more seeders and hence more upload slots with each new seeder, then things will accelerate. 

I don't think I ever saw enigma when I was downloading. His upload queue must have been perpetually filled for the past month. But I did see the availability ratio slowly creep up like a snail from torrent hell.

I can say this... I won't be downloading a torrent of this size for a long time. It's not that I don't appreciate what enigma has done but if they were separate torrents I could have gotten them all in a week.

At least if half of the present leechers stay on for the next week or so, we'll have a pretty healthy torrent. Other will be able to get this gargantuan torrent relatively quickly.

Thanks again, enigma. I think I speak for everyone... we do appreciate your efforts."

I havent downloading everything yet so, please keep the copy in your HD, ok? :D"

What happened to the seeders?
Please people, stop being selfish!
enigma907 thank you very much again."
,VictorTheGreat,2008-01-22T12:33Z,"Ok! 5 minutes ago I had the happiest moment of my week. I have finished downloading it. 100%.
I'm sorry for my stupidity but, what am I supposed to do now?
The description says ""Burn Ready!""
I just want to see the damn thing (pardon my expression)!
PS.: I dont have this thing people call NERO!
Thanks."
,parthipa84,2008-01-22T16:18Z,Load it using Deamon tools Mr.VictorTheGreat 
,enigma907,2008-01-23T04:29Z,"What he said would work, then you could open it with windvd or something.

Or just use a video player that opens isos directly... like vlc or mpc... (VideoLan Client or Media Player Classic)... if you're gunna be downloading videos you probably want to get both those programs anyway, as they play pretty much everything, and if one has issues with a certain video file, the other works (in my experience).

you could also extract each iso to a folder with winrar... then use something like windvd to play from a folder"
,enigma907,2008-01-23T04:42Z,"just out of curiosity, i tried to see if windows media player could play isos... i have wmp10, and when I tried to open the iso it gave me some warning about not being supported but probably could play it anyways, so I said yeah and it got to the dvd menu no problem.  i wasted about a minute clicking and hitting keys and couldnt quite figure out how to navigate the menu or start the movie, after stumbing around submenus i didnt want to be in it eventually started, but I'm not sure what worked, not very intuitive that's for sure.... anyways point is it's possible (but wmp or vlc are better)."
,enigma907,2008-01-23T04:46Z,"(i meant mpc or vlc are better, doh!)"
,parthipa84,2008-01-23T15:53Z,pls everybody seed for some more time
,VictorTheGreat,2008-01-23T17:20Z,"Thanks master(enigma907)!
I could watch it and it's fantastic!
And, yes, I am seeding now. Well, at list I think I am as uploading rate shows 59kB/s.
Hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did."
,khoi16,2008-01-27T07:32Z,"Hey Enigma907!...
I downloaded this from mininova and i read that image of disc 1 and 4 was bad...
Is this true?... I'm kinda worried.. and i really want to watch a good quality movie..
thx"
,Kitsunisan,2008-01-29T23:31Z,"Is this uncompressed, full hd?  Size makes me think so, but can someone confirm before I try this?"
,enigma907,2008-01-31T05:18Z,"there's nothing wrong with the file, [anyone else who has watched it please reply to confirm]; i think that guy on minonova is complaining about picture quality I think, but it's pretty typical of dvd9 (double layer) compressed to dvd5 with dvdshrink doing the deep analysis.  I downloaded disc 1 (found torrent on mininova), but discs 2-5 werent available as dvd5 (single layer) so I DL'd the dvd9 version and did the shrink myself.

If you want quality and to play it from a pc, then download the hd version, it's definately higher quality for the same size file.  H.264 compression is much better than mpeg2 that dvds use (rule of thumb is 4 gig mpeg2 looks like 2gig h.264), and its a better source (1080p hd-dvd, not 480p dvd like these)... so a 4.37 GiB 720p x264 HDDVD rip (in matroska for example) looks MUCH better than a 4.37 GiB 480p mpeg2 DVDRip.  And since the hd rips on p2p usually have one audio track, theres even more space for the video than a DVD with 2+ audio tracks (5.1 AC3 can take more than half a gig).  [As a matter of fact, I usually download 720p matroska myself, as I have my pc hooked up to my hdtv... but for this I wanted a disc playable at my dads house on his ntsc only dvd player, as he's really into this kinda stuff.  And I only have a single layer burner/media.

So download this if you want to burn these for use on a dvd player as a dvd and only have a singler layer drive or discs (dvd5).  Otherwise, get the hdrips, much better quality.    
Something like this: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3891716/BBC_Planet_Earth_720p 
or if you have lotsa disc space or dual layer discs:

,contradiction,2008-02-09T12:43Z,"Yeah... when trying to burn it I'm getting the ""invalid or unsupported image file format"" message both w Roxio and Decrpter. And it just looks like any other ISO file. What to do?"
,myglove,2008-02-12T13:05Z,"(I posted this at mininova, too)

hey, thanks for the upload, however...

I finished downloading this (took a while, of course) and was very disappointed to see that the quality is maybe on par with VHS quality at some points. there's tons of blurriness, and it looks like some kind of awful compression was used. for me, and I'm not really a videophile, it makes the movie unwatchable.

I thought maybe it was just my setup (using VLC media player) but I tried other decoders with no change in the results.

I'm now downloading this version http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3891716/BBC_Planet_Earth_720p It's only a few GB more and people have said the quality is amazing. I suggest anyone downloading this torrent also switch, or be ready to be disappointed. I guarantee you that the quality is possibly worse than VHS at times."

,ldrinker,2008-07-13T00:14Z,Don't waste your time. Picture quality was so low that I threw away the discs and deleted the files. Worst-quality DVD download that I've ever encountered!
