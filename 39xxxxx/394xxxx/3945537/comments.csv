,standuper,2007-12-30T09:34Z,"m8 that isn't the way to do this  :| . i and many, many others have downloaded 1,8 gigs of your download, just like before on download that also no one didn't finished because the uploader has stop to seed him. so no one has finish your download and now it isn't fair from you that after a days and days of downloading you remove your dvd and we all have trow our time and our traffic in waste  :( . that simply isn't the way. you have offered to all of us here and at the pirate org that you will upload this dvd.
so please share it till the end."
