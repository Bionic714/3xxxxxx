,cir0w,2008-06-25T15:42Z,"I've downloaded it but cant get the subs work.
I have extracted the sub.rar file and after that i've put the sub file like this in vlc:

opened vlc (without a movie in)
file/open file
then selected the movie
then checkmarked the ""use a sub"" or something
choosed the sub file that i've extracted
the pressed ok

but when the movie runs it doesn't show any subtitle or a menu there u can choose a sub :S

what the problem? If u read the MS-info dokument that comes with the download, it says that swedish with many others subs are availbe in that file :S

plz help 

one little less important thing is that when I open the movie and the movie is running it has a pink colour in the screen that ruins the whole movie. I tried to reopen but it became the same result. Whats the problem? 

btw the first question is the most important ;)

thx for helping.."
,SAJAD.C.,2008-07-21T15:22Z,Now that the download is done the file is separated in 3 files for each of the movies but when I click on the movies I just files everywhere. WHAT SHOULD I DO???? 
,SAJAD.C.,2008-07-21T15:24Z,"Sorry
*I just see files everywhere"
,Matt7y,2008-08-02T23:11Z,Download VLC player!
,funzzy,2008-08-19T17:42Z,Seed please!!!
,phughed,2008-08-31T11:41Z,"Comeon people... When you limit your d/l to 1k/sec that is not seeding. That is just plain rude. I am stuck with a crappy DSL conection until I get back into my apartment where my lovely cable resides, but I am not bottlenecking my upload limits to a ridiculous 1k/sec. Hell the best speed I am getting is a 10k/sec d/l from Finland? Sad American here... Thanks Finish IP - whoever you are!"
,enkeksinimeejee,2008-09-09T22:39Z,is it good quality?
,xPROxFlame,2008-12-13T12:53Z,"My download speed for this only goes at 100kb/sec
Seed Please"
,grinboy,2009-03-31T08:17Z,widescreen??
,littleriffy,2009-04-13T14:55Z,"u guys are complaining about your download speeds. Hell, im lucky if i get 50k/s where I'm at. And there are always seeders that do not limit their upload, but u just gotta connect to them"
,hks_911,2009-05-04T04:39Z,"hey the subs are not working.....i tried it in gom, vlc everything
