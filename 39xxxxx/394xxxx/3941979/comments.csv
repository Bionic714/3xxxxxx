,jjkc9000,2007-12-22T16:41Z,"I am seeding this I assure you. Unfortunately, I can only upload at 20 kbps max.  New to making torrents and have found that - rather than it prioritising the upload of un-uploaded pieces - I have only uploaded 30.2% of the total file (despite 800 Mb in all).  Will not stop seeding until a good number of seeders are on the file but fear it will be a little while before there is more than just me! Take care."
