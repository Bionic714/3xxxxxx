Can anyone post the album 'Detroit featuring Mitch Ryder'? It' brilliant but hard to find.

Cheers"
,Johanteunis,2008-05-13T02:23Z,MORE MITCH RYDER PLEASE.
,doowopsam,2008-07-28T16:11Z,Plz note that yr Mustang Sally has nothing to do with Mitch Ryder but is actually from the movie The Commitments. Otherwise great stompin' Motor City blue-eyed soul. Thanks!
