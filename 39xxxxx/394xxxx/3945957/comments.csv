one of the stupidest movie ever...

:)"
,Blangle,2008-02-03T14:59Z,"holy crap that movie sucked bad. spent so much time building up that father/son thing that you immediately knew that the kid'd die, the bad guys were cartoon characters, terrible casting, acting. just a steaming pile of hot mess is all."
,Zetoss,2008-02-05T03:33Z,"Very slow and poorly scripted/performed movie in general. It has it's moments of nice violence and like a total of 3 fun lines, but not even that can save this pile of shit from stinking. Good quality tho, thumbs up for FXG!"
,Sparc0z,2008-02-12T12:18Z,"Good quality and the movie its awsome, thanks ; ) "
,okultus,2008-02-29T14:58Z,"Despite the negative comments here, I thought the movie was a good action/thriller flick worth watching on a Friday night over some beers especially with Kevin Bacon having his ups and downs throughout his career. I saved it.."
