,vvertigo,2009-09-19T18:09Z,"@sxypink: probably a little closer to what you were looking for, check out:

Soulwax (and their amazing album Nite Versions), !!!, The Rapture, Hot Chip, YACHT, The Phenomenal Handclap Band, and pretty much any band signed to DFA Records (which James Murphy co-founded). 

All of these bands and LCD Soundsystem are classified as Dance Punk.

Although the list by rageagainstthemachine is pretty good it's mostly unrelated Electronica except for Goose and early MSTRKRFT."
