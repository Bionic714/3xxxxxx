Shogo Mobile Armor Division version 1.0 CD ROM for Win95,98,2k, and XP untested on Vista but I recommend you avoid Vista in any case... get patches and updates at http://shogo-mad.com and http://shogomad.com . Shogo Mobile Armor devision is a multi player shoot em up game originally made in 1998 and is much like Quake 2 except it has the addition of playable mechs.
