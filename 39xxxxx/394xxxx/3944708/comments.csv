,spacey1,2007-12-23T07:53Z,"   Infantile intolerance speaks again while i am the 1 seed only, and no one has had the time to watch this as of now.  'More un-biased' was the term stated.  No documentary is 100% un-biased bloke.

,duhprane,2007-12-25T03:36Z,"UN BIASED - HOLY CRAP you must watch the 9/11 BBC coverage where they announce the collapse of  wtc7 with it standing in the background.... BBC is total propaganda.... have you never read 1984.... what Orwell was talking about was 1948 and his life experiences including his job writing propaganda for the BBC.... the number of people interested in watching and downloading hasnt got shit to do with belief in what they have yet to watch, silly ass...."

no one knows the whole truth...this is a documentary."

,spacey1,2008-01-01T13:53Z,"I have not only read '1984', I have also written a 10 page research paper on his writings.  Everything these days could be labeled 'propaganda'.  It's all about the side you are on.  Most of 1984 was correlations from Russian WWII history, not England.  The scratching of the faces, and the memory tubes?  Do you know about the American Ohio neo-digital billboards?  Write your own research paper and then talk to me...    "
