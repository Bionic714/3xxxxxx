" Magic M The Italian Lucio Aqulina is another module of the steadily growing Italo Techno phenomenon around protagonists from the likes of Davide Squillace or Renato Figoli. 2007 was the year of breakthrough for the young man from Naples, who released six records on labels like Trapez, Minisketch or Adagio within a short time only. His Cocoon Recordings debut "Magic M" is a nicely addlebrained Tech House tune with weird acid sounds that catch up with smooth harmonies and even some reverbed dub effects. A real highlight for fans of the works of Luciano or Ricardo Villalobos. "
