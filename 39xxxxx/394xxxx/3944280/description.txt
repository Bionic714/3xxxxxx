A Very Peculiar Practice, Series 2.

A Very Peculiar Practice was a British comedy show from the mid-1980s -very dark in it's humor, with extreme characterization and bizzare situations, set around a University Medical Practice.

The main characters were Dr Steven Daker (the new, young, impressionable one), Dr Jock McCannon (the old, alcoholic, world-weary one), Dr Bob Buzzard (the bitter, egotistical, abrasive one) and Dr Rose Marie (the feminist, bisexual, politically motivated one). Add to these a smattering of students, lecturers, the regular love interests for Dr Daker (Lyn in Series 1, and Greta in Series 2) and the strangely compelling nuns that roamed the campus causing mayhem. Then throw in plots that cause emotional, physical, or mental reactions, and sit back to watch.
