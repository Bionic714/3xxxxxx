FROM: Info.txt - in the .rar.



You may wish to print labels for these DVDs. 
However, that can be become expensive after just several, 
so you may prefer to use a Sharpie to title the DVD.

Be aware that a DVD-R will not play on all DVD players. 
A computers DVD drive should play them, but some consumer DVD players will only be able to play a DVD-ROM; 
the most common format for DVDs of movies.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Extract the .rar file with a program like winRAR, found here:

The file, Ron Paul Reveres DVD 2.iso is the only file to be put onto the DVD, and then the burning may begin. 
It is that simple. The file is already set to be placed on the DVD-nothing needs to be done to it.
Note that the two .jpg picture files need not be included in the DVDs directory.
