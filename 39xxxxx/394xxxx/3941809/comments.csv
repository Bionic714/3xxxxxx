,antti945,2007-12-27T16:28Z,dont write Call of Duty 4 Single Player Crack (v1.4) when it is for server 
,snapple1121,2007-12-28T06:51Z,"What are you talking about? It's not for a server, it's for single player. If you cared to notice, after extracting the RAR, you have two files. iw3sp.exe and readme.txt. Stating the obvious, iw3sp.exe is for ""Single Player""... No-where in this torrent is their a server file. 

Don't write a comment if you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about... and your blatant disregard for noticing this is a single player crack, not server crack."
,turk4eva,2007-12-31T21:09Z,hey guys  when i open the file and click iwsp or what ever it says that mss.32.dll is missing what is that?
,snapple1121,2008-01-01T00:49Z,"You need to put the crack in your Call of Duty 4 directory: 
C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare

Replace the one that is already in there with the one you downloaded."
,turk4eva,2008-01-01T05:47Z,i cant find the file activision. i can only find the file that i downloaded.
,snapple1121,2008-01-01T06:22Z,Then you do not even have Call of Duty 4 installed on your machine; or you have installed it in another directory.
,Pzych0_,2008-01-01T16:12Z,Is it a speciel torrnet you need to download?
,onehandharry,2008-01-01T19:35Z,"Good one snapple... Worked first time, and no nasty suprise in the download. 


Download the torrent
Extract the 2 files using WINRAR or similar
read the README file. D'oh.
Replace the new "" iw3sp.exe"" file with the file of the same name , which is in the directory where you installed the game. 
And run.
Brilliant."
,Pzych0_,2008-01-01T23:48Z,I meen that is it eny speciel CoD4 torrent you need to download? Or is it just to pick and chose?
,I3lackArrow,2008-01-02T03:21Z,"Umm, I got a kind of a problem, after running the game a litte while, maybe one half level my computer crashes,, It just turns pitch dark and the power goes of.. anyone having the same problem? 

I would really apreciate some help with this since I do really love the Call of duty games.. "
,snapple1121,2008-01-02T04:38Z,"This does not have to do with the crack. Occasionally, when I am doing multiple things and playing single player at the same time, mine does the same thing. But most of the time when just playing single player for some time, it runs fine. This is most likely a lack of cooling or power supply."
,Pzych0_,2008-01-03T16:30Z,Works fine this thing : ) Thanks.

,ck323,2008-01-05T22:05Z,"I'm a bit slow and this is probably a stupid question, but when the readme says:
""Replace the file 'iw3sp.exe' with the one currently installed (C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare\iw3sp.exe)"",
where do I get the one ""currently installed""?

I looked in my program files and there is no Activision file.

Thanks"
,ton2008,2008-01-05T23:52Z,when i try and extract the files it says its failed to start because mss32.dll was not found..... nd i read the document that came with i but dont understand what to do... can any1 help me plz
,snapple1121,2008-01-06T22:17Z,"ck323:

You get the one ""currently installed"" from when you installed the game. This crack doesn't come with the full game, which is need to run a cracked server. You can download the full game by searching ""Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare"" in the search area of thepiratebay.org (or my favorite, http://youtorrent.com)


ton2008:
Noob, if you bothered to read the readme(and was not illiterate and could understand), you would come to a conclusion that you need the game installed before you can proceed with the crack. First, install the full game, then replace the crack that you downloaded in this torrent with the one you have already installed (that came with the full game). 

It's mind boggling how people like you can figure out how to download a torrent but not a simple game crack. Did you really think the full game was 1.17MiB? Phew..."
,snapple1121,2008-01-06T22:19Z,"And I also love when people beg, its entertaining like this guy did above:

""...nd i read the document that came with i but dont understand what to do... can any1 help me plz...""

Ha, ha!"

,wilicemo,2008-01-21T04:33Z,I got a cease and desist letter from my internet provider so I need a torrent that wont be tracked like the last one. Where can I find a COD 4 file that will be somewhat safe? Thanks in advance.
,upploader,2008-01-21T16:41Z,hey. Im maybe a noob but i need some help. When shall i run the crack?! 
,JDragon82,2008-01-24T02:14Z,what about a missing mss32.dll??? anyone know about that one?
,JDragon82,2008-01-24T02:21Z,do i need to delete the iso file too?
