My file wouldn't come up in a search of ""1 or one million years BC"" because I forgot toseperate the words of the name with spaces after ripping. So here it is again in more search-freindly format-RUBrTOE"

,{HWR}_Hooah,2008-01-02T15:40Z,"everyone needs to set there uploads rate to unlimited, including rubbertow, he post the torrent then set upload rate to 1kb. very kind of you rubbertow. remember the faster you upload the faster your downloads are. because everyone transfers to each other."
,RubberTow,2008-01-04T19:35Z,"to:{HWR}_Hooah: that's right dick breath, I do set the uploads of thmy downloads to 1kb. so i can upload my own rips at a faster speed so ignorant freaks like you can upload my stuff faster, so ya know what: suck a big one if that's not your thing-RUBrTOE"
