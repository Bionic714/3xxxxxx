PLEASE"
,LogiC123,2007-12-27T00:25Z,"My internet went down for a couple of hours today, sorry for the holdup."
,Draconius,2007-12-27T14:56Z,"What size are the rars are after extraction?
also thank you very much."
,LogiC123,2007-12-27T22:23Z,The thing is 14.9GiB when extraced
,bodi664,2007-12-28T02:50Z,Please seed. I'm stuck at 95.6%. I will seed.
,Pyatin,2007-12-28T04:17Z,"yeah.  might wanna work on that 24/7 upload because you've got nearly 150 people at 95.6%.

Such a shame.  was a promising torrent too."
,LogiC123,2007-12-28T14:45Z,"I'm back in buisness!
*Seeding*

My internet has been really strange the past 2 days, it just randomly dies.
The ISP will send a report to their technicians to fix it."
,elliej,2007-12-29T01:26Z,"So far it works very well, but when I'm using the Nestopia with Mario Bros., the screen freezes every time I jump! Any help out there?

PS-What a great dnld for all those of us who haven't played on a game system since the original Nintendo!"
,elliej,2007-12-29T01:46Z,Is there a help file? The Help in the Nestopia program is greyed out. 
,Pyatin,2007-12-29T03:06Z,"It downloaded completely.  Also tested for virus (ritual habit. No offense.) Came up clean.

Nestopia is quite quirky, but the ROMs worked nice with ""Virtual NES"" and without issue.  I'd recommend that one.

The N64 emulator is definitely one of the more stable emulators I've used.  Thanks for sharing.  I'm known to upload per data amount and not so much for ratio.  I usually upload for about 50-60GB."
,jobo77,2007-12-29T11:28Z,"I've been using emulators for over ten years, and Nintendo games are favorites. This pack truely is fantastic, as you get pretty much everything, and all the japan released roms are left out, which IMO is great. You might wanna use another NES emulator though. Hats off! Download this."
,Draconius,2008-01-03T13:08Z,I must say this is a fantastic download unfortunately my upload speed sucks so I won't be able to share very well :(
,thomasandre9595,2008-01-04T23:04Z,"you know in the torrent called ""All steam games with online play v2"" I wrote a comment like said.. "" the updates on the games who dont wanna update. like portal and hl2 ep 2.. it is deleted from the page.."" i said... Then u wrote back ""I will come with another update to pacsteam the 2'nd of january. And now you just have this comment..  Why? please reply.."
,s4vdout,2008-01-07T08:10Z,Pyatin your a worthless piece of shit fyi...  who cares if YOU THINK this was a good torrent or not because of it's speed and you being stuck at 95%.  Suck a FAT dick.. The world is not here to please you and the WORLD does not revolve around you
,Thaevilguy,2008-01-08T15:38Z,"thanks it took just 3 minutes i will seed

"

,snowboardboy101,2008-04-09T17:00Z,Need more seeders.  I've been downloading at 0.2kb/s for two days.
,Sanguinsanity,2008-04-20T07:12Z,"This is awesome, man thanks. I love playing games from my childhood."

,76deluxe,2008-05-10T21:32Z,"Does this work for mac?

Anybody know of an N64 emulator for mac please send me link at 836media@gmail.com"
,LogiC123,2008-05-11T15:15Z,"It does have the first Zelda for the NES.

A Playstation Pack would be like over a terabyte since one game is a 600mb ISO."
,theone827,2008-06-10T02:49Z,"I am new to pirate bay and this is goin to sound really stupid, but how do you seed?

,Rugapand,2008-08-06T19:47Z,"Is this pack a rehash of the Rensets?

Is it organized?

Does it contain all regions' roms or just america?

(Does anyone know where to find SnesRen,NesRen etc.?) "
,buckeye1408,2008-08-21T01:50Z,"I am not very computer savvy, but, the second I started to extract with winrar, Norton said that a trojan horse has been detected and blocked.  Again, I dont know much about viruses, but, I am assuming that this trojan horse came from the emulator (I could be wrong though).  Can someone please explain this to me since I am somewhat retarded.

Thanks"

,roliasmot,2008-10-04T07:32Z,Logi if you have any advice on the N64 emulator crash issue it would be appreciative...I do notice one pattern and that is each one of us who get that crash uses vista. :( Vista should burn. Period. But on top of that...any info? :D Thanks for the great game pack! Brings back TONS of memories! ^_^
,Rudeboy klautz,2008-10-11T00:39Z,Plz gif some seed power on this one. Want this really badly :D.
,atlantisisdead,2008-10-13T03:37Z,"Thank you so much. Even though a couple of games aren't working (ActRaiser II for instance) everyone here who has downloaded game roms for any emulator KNOWS that more than half the time there is a problem with more than half of them working. And of those which do, there are a few glitches.. Not only is this set complete for every Nintendo system, it is SUPERB. Thank you, and thank you again. Jungle Strike. Gradius III. Starfox. Boy and his Blob!! Prince of Persia. I could go on,.. because EVERY FKG GAME IS THERE. Thank you. Did I say Thank You?"
,macbacon,2008-11-16T00:10Z,"""It does have the first Zelda for the NES.""

,mohra5468,2009-02-03T01:31Z,I ran a virus scan a couple days ago after downloading this torrent and there was a virus linked to the file.

,AvI,2009-09-27T13:03Z,"Thank you so much for this! Works perfect, no problem what so ever! People saying there's a trojan - that's BULLSHIT.. The virus scanner believes it's a trojan because it's an emulator program, nothing else. So people - DOWNLOAD this great collection (: "

(to the idiots who say there is a trojan, yes there is, but it's not harmful & your scanner will remove it automatically, it's just because they are emulators.)"
,mrdreamers4u,2011-06-27T00:00Z,Does anyone know where to download a nes emulator (not snes) for ps2 to burn to dvdr's not cdr's  to play on modded ps2??
