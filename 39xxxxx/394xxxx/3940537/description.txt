From imdb.com:

"Academy Award winner Ernest Borgnine, star of the classic train movie "Emperor of the North", hosts this remarkable examination of the uniquely America Hobo. Hear compelling tales of life as a migratory worker from these notable former Hobos, such as Pulitzer Prize winner, James A Michener, country music legend Merle Haggard, and many other adventurous free spirits who have crisscrossed our vast nation on the awesome railroads."

While the second half is a cornball promo for the National Hobo Association, founded by Santa Fe Bo--a.k.a director Bobb Hopkins--this is a must see for railfans, freight hoppers and history buffs, if only for its wonderful footage of and from American and Canadian freights.
