here is a dusty little gem from my "Cult Classics" hard drive~


Twelve outrageous guests. Four scandalous requests. And one lone bellhop, in his first day on the job, who's in for the wildest New year's Eve of his life...




too many stars to mention- willis, tarantino, banderas the list goes on...

...And I guarantee none of them ever worked for this little money, ever again. LOL!


What a great movie, I'm actually sore from laughing...



Merry 'effing Christmas,

Ps- my parrot says "hello"
