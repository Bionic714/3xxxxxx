,angeskog,2008-02-04T18:07Z,Tank u DarkLittleApartmentStudios!
,intoxicatedemon,2008-02-29T05:25Z,Excellent movie. Thank You!
,spavin,2008-03-04T19:26Z,"I downloaded this, played it thru winamp and media player and both times it just played the audio. they seem to think is is an mpeg 3

do I need to convert it, get a codec, or is it a duff file?"
,ganyen,2008-03-08T20:22Z,"I am currently downloading this so I haven't had a change to test it out,but I would suggest using VLC media player. I haven't found anything that it wouldn't play yet. It will even repair broken avi's. Trust me you will like VLC player. Oh and sometimes you have to change the audio channel type in VLC to get good sound."
,korpatalik,2008-03-18T15:48Z,downloading. hope it'll run for me well. thanx a lot.
,darklittleapartmentstudio,2008-04-03T17:07Z,"ganyen -do not use the repair option on vlc, that's how torrents get destroyed. Vlc simply cuts out the bad part, and doesn't repair anything. I have had it cut out more than 45 minutes...  when vlc says ""this file is broken, would you like to repair"" say no, and just watch the 3-second blip.

yes, vlc plays anything, But don't use the repair option. It has had this problem for years.

I had to delete a torrent this morning, corrupted,I think that's how it happened.

p.s. codecs = virus.

just get vlc."
,floxel,2008-07-23T14:53Z,"works perfect with vlc. no problems.
thx 4 seeding!"

,spookytoothe,2009-08-17T22:43Z,"It's a great movie but when converted to DVD and viewed on a good size TV, the video quality is really bad. maybe a 4 out of 10."
,spookytoothe,2009-08-17T22:45Z,It's watchable on the pc but I like to go DVD.
,darklittleapartmentstudio,2009-08-28T05:59Z,"it's a 730 mb file dillweed. 

most dvd's are over 4 gb.

dvd's hold considerably more data, and run at least three times the bitrate.(and cost thirteen dollars you shmuck!)

an avi is a compressed file...and the quality of this one is @ least 8/10 on my 24"" widescreen.    :p

LOL! do you know what a .vob file is?!   LOFL!

up evil, DARKLITTLEAPARTMENTSTUDIOS  "
