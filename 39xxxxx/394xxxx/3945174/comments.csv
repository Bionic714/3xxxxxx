,LeDrewxcore,2008-08-01T23:46Z,Filmed 4 times. I am Omega was released long before I am Legend.
,spoogebeast,2008-11-13T02:00Z,"@LeDrewxcore

Wrong. There have been three film adaptations; The Last Man on Earth, The Omega Man and I Am Legend."
,tanithharbinger,2010-07-06T03:46Z,"actually, LeDrewxcore  is right. I am Omega was one of the films based on this. Look it up on wiki."
