WOODEN SHJIPS 

Wooden Shjips is a quartet from San Francisco that plays loud rock 창??n창?? roll in a style 
heavily influenced by the experimentalism of psychedelia, classical minimalism, 
and garage rock excess. Started as an experiment in rhythmic primitivism and group improvisation, 
the current lineup brings a more structured rock approach to its performances, 
utilizing a traditional lineup of drums (Omar Ahsanuddin), bass (Dusty Jermier), 
organ (Nash Whalen), guitar (Erik 창??Ripley창?? Johnson), and vocals.
