Destined to become one of the most popular syndicated television shows of all time, Highway Patrol screamed onto the scene with fast cars and the catch phrase "10-4". Each week, Chief Dan Matthews (Broderick Crawford) would lead his troops into another roadway adventure. Using high powered cars, motorcycles and helicopters, The Highway Patrol appealed greatly to young males and many future law enforcement recruits watched faithfully each week as narrator Art Gilmore proclaimed:

"Whenever the laws of any state are broken, a duly authorized organization swings into action. It may be called the State Police, State Troopers, militia, the Rangers, or the Highway Patrol. These are the stories of the men whose training, skill, and courage have enforced and preserved our state laws."
