Everything you will find here is perfect. Just check the logfiles and see for yourself. Hell, burn it in a correctly write-offset writer and rerip the burn to check the AccurateRip CRCs. And if you're really paranoid, you can check the EAC CRCs as well. If it's not flawlessly ripped and confidence checked against multiple drives, I don't release it.

Burn (using a correctly write-offset writer) with the confidence that this is bit-for-bit identical to the original. And transcode to whatever lossy format you like.
