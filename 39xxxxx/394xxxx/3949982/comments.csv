,FamousTonyC,2007-12-29T00:42Z,"What's the story on port forwarding, folx?  I reviewed the info at Port Forward.com, and am still unsure how PFing increases download/upload speeds.  Please advise.  Gracias."
,ezboard,2008-01-23T21:03Z,"you idiot, it doesen't change your speed, it lets you use shit that might have a problem with a router!
like say for instance you're like me, and have a Versalink high speed router/modem thing that connects to your DSL for y ou, and say you're trying to install Apache and SQL and stuff so you can host your own message board.
But you come to find out the modem is a piece of shit when it comes to letting you do anything like that.
You need to tell it to open some ports to use this shit, but you got no fucking clue what to do.
THIS does it for you!"

,Etherian,2008-05-19T04:27Z,"Do you kiss your mom with those mouths? Anyways, I agree, if you want to share files don't use eDonkey. Oh, and ezboard, port forwarding does increase speed of torrents, because it doesn't have to go around the router."

DOWNLOADING THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME"
