Murder in Mind 1997 Xvid

Yahoo Synopsis: A femme fatale accused of murdering her husband attempts to clear her name with deep regression hypnosis, only to discover that her buried memories are full of twisted secrets.

Real Synopsis: Pretty cheesy, but Mary-Louise Parker sure does spend a lot of time being cute and hypnotized.

This DVD isn't available in the US (region 1), and I'm not sure it ever was, so, unless you caught it on HBO 10 years ago, most US residents have probably never seen it.
