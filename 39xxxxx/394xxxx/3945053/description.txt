Brygada Kryzys was one of the most important and influencial Polish rock band in the eighties and early nineties. I upload their first LP from 1982, later rereleased on CD. More about the band and its history here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brygada_Kryzys A half of the songs from the CD is sung in Polish, the other half in English. The music itself surprisingly has not grown old much.

The upload contains:
- the CD content converted with Ogg Vorbis encoder v.1.12 (Q8, approx. 256 Kbps) with AotuV optizations, properly tagged
- the miniature of the cover (400x400 pixels)
- the copy of original contract between the band and the recording company (what the LP contains, play times, etc., as you see the LP was recorded with a Studer studio tape recorder :-)) 

Enjoy!
