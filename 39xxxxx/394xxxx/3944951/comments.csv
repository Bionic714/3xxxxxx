but upload rate is unrestricted.
I'll be sure to seed for one year
or to 10:1 ratio.

Thanks much for the up."
,Nazca_,2007-12-24T11:11Z,"Havin just a one source, i cant see this being any good..."
,phisher,2007-12-24T14:23Z,"boohoo, STFU really, every torrent has one seed to begin initially, so unless youre not gonna help on seeding, just be quiet. No one is forcing you to DL really anything.

It would be funny to see an automatic torrent client that would read on positive/negative feedback alternating upload speed :P enough if bad feedbacks and would be seeding at 1k/s. Would serve just right towards jackasses like yourself. (And yes, I dont have any christmas mood still here and just the fact that I'm too lazy to walk to other computer to alter the upload speed is the only obstacle from dropping the speed on seeding)"
,jkarembeu,2007-12-25T13:01Z,"Solid work Phisher!
Season 5 torrent was top class! Looking forward to this one too!"
,jthm,2007-12-26T21:53Z,"Thanks, I will seed this for a while to help out.  I hope you are limiting your upload to just one user until they have 100% otherwise it would takes years to get additional seeders."
,phisher,2007-12-27T13:02Z,"its is actually a single torrent uploads :D previously season too a bit less than 2 weeks to complete on constant upload apart of  random reboot that was needed for computer due updates and crap like that. But eventually, it will get there."
,Nightowl247,2007-12-27T20:06Z,"You guys are just unf*****g believable !
phisher has had all the work with ripping and packing and even writing a lot of info for you guys. Even the part about his slow upload. 
What part of his info did you not understand about patience and ""no bitching""?
phisher got the job done with season 5! Why should he not get it done with season 6?
jthm's idea of only seeding to one leecher is the most stupid idea of the year! What are you going to do if he is one of the many ""hit and runners""? No, super-seeding is the only way to seed! We just all have to help phisher by seeding all we can. That way phisher does not have to seed the same part of the torrent to 50 leechers, get it?

THX for the upload and all your work phisher!
Keep up the good work and do not listen to all these knobs! 

Happy new year to all pirates !

,phisher,2007-12-27T21:50Z,"I wont take the credit of ripping the disks here, but for downloading and the consequently uploading out here, thats the evil work, but hey, ungratitude is the payout one gets here. (and those whines, of slow speed, i wont say a thing) 

If one is in real rush, I would suggest to get familiarized with newsgroups, as of this moment, all xfiles seasons from 5 to 9 are still available there, and it wont take such a long time to dl :P (no I wont call anyone by name here, but you get the hint; 40USD/3 months isnt that bad of a cost for unlimited downloads, but why bother paying anything when it all comes here for free, teeheehee)"
,jthm,2008-01-04T23:43Z,"Thanks, but you seriously need to limit your seeding to just a couple of peers, it will exponentially increase the amount of seeds for this torrent."
,phisher,2008-01-05T16:21Z,"righty, jthm, backtrack couple of pasts upwards to nightowls comments, and think again. what if selected few would all be hit and run persons? would make me just waste my time and bw for nothing at all.

@ the moment there are 20 or so all at 89% completed so shouldnt take much more when its all completed. If you're in rush, pick a grannys pocket and get a decent news server access and grab the series there."
,jthm,2008-01-05T17:23Z,Even if one of those 20 werent a hit and run it would still increase the number of seeds :)
,phisher,2008-01-06T20:42Z,"seeding the torrent 20 times over and over in worst case scenario, you have to be farking kidding me... 20*26.5gb = too damn long transfer time to be spent on single torrent."
,phisher,2008-01-07T12:57Z,"Seeding completed, dont kill it now, since i will be removing the source files here to save space. Took me only 2 weeks or so to seed thru, so all sceptics, FU for doubts =) See ya next time."
,jthm,2008-01-09T00:14Z,"Thanks, 2 weeks is still along time when your dl speed is 1500kbs :) Ill seed as much as I can, but comcast just threatened to blacklist me for 12 months if i dont cut my usage, what a bunch of fuckers."
,szucsok,2008-02-07T09:30Z,Is not the rest of the parts accidental ???
,spooky psychic,2008-02-26T22:35Z,Many thanks for the up :-) this is a keeper
,Dana_Skully,2008-03-19T04:08Z,And the others Season's on DVD ?
,anelisse,2008-05-12T19:53Z,"this season is the collector edition, with all the bonus from????"
,Olsson17,2008-09-13T14:37Z,Hey Phiser do you have season 1 to 3 of X-files?
,givmignubareadgang,2008-09-17T19:01Z,"first off, thanks a bunch for uploading this ! been looking for ages, and the dll didnt take that long afterall considdering the size.

I have a problem though, i dont really know how to play this thing. if i just open the whole folder with VLC the episodes are split up into small 39sec clips, and sometimes the order is not correct, in addition to this some of it is syncronized with russian voices or something like that. have tried to mount it with daemon tools, but no working files in the folder either.

i am probably just beeing a noob here, but can anyone please help me out ? :)

thanks in advance and once again thanks for the upload!"
,phisher,2008-10-09T14:41Z,"You just need to extract the rar archives that would produce .img/.iso disc image, that you will then burn (with nero or imgburn for example) to DVD-r disc and pop that in player."
,nikitoz555,2008-12-17T18:09Z,Please SPEED UP!!!!
,tomasj69,2009-01-14T01:30Z,"YouÂ´re the man ,Phisher!!!
But please keep seeing, I really want this one!
So please??? SEEED.....!!!!"
,phisher,2009-02-02T03:02Z,"I no longer have these files available, so cant help by reseeding anymore, its all up to current seeder/downloaders to keep this one alive. (I left off when there was 6 seeders approx 10 months ago)"
,Whirlinurd,2009-03-04T04:29Z,"I've been downloading since season 1 and arrived at season 7 at the moment. Now I have stumbled on a problem. Disc 2 is password protected. The original torrent and comments aren't here anymore.

Can someone help me out to find the correct password. Or maybe if it's not too much trouble upload the DVD5 Pal version of Season 7 Disc 2."
,phisher,2009-03-07T07:20Z,"season 7 here:
