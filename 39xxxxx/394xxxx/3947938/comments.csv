There are so many bullshit torrents on this site.
I had to d/l , I am legend 4 times , before I got to see it!
At least I can be sure your torrents are real, & clean.
Thanks also for the explain to svart , I like to learn about new methods. I wanted to ask ,but didnt want  to hassle you.
There is another site , besides fss, but they have alot of rules , then again this site has to few, noid     had just the right mix."
,mistertpitydafoo,2007-12-26T16:26Z,"No hassle. I like helping people, especially those who take the time to post a comment. It's nice at least a few people take the time to thank me for uploading. There is only a few of you that do that so I appreciate it even more cuz it means that much more when  you take the time to thank me. I will always be willing to answer questions and especially those who have contributed to the Kung Fu community or at least take the time to post a comment in my torrent. Don't hesitate to ask."
