,mikke205,2007-12-22T23:31Z,Any comments? Does it work?
,MrSr,2007-12-23T09:18Z,Works lika a charm. Thx
,cearjo,2007-12-23T10:42Z,works 110%. thx..
,bmwtorrents,2007-12-23T12:35Z,"No problem- hope it comes in handy.

Please make sure you continue to SEED!

Thanks."
,320dat,2007-12-24T16:40Z,"Fantastic, just tested on my 2007 E91 Navi Pro.
Thanks a lot"
,Fysle,2007-12-28T12:09Z,"I just wonder, what kind of dvd should I use? Is it the Verbatim DVD-R or Verbatim DVD+R I should use? It says here in the infosection that DVD+R should work, but I thought it was the DVD-R that is the correct one.. Anyone who knows for sure?"
,320dat,2007-12-30T09:57Z,I have tried both. The Verbatim -R worked ok but very slow on search for adresses and such. Commodore +R however worked fine with rapid search results. Same experience with earlier version (2007-2). Speed cams for Norway are great.
,Fysle,2007-12-30T21:39Z,thankyou :)  I'll try that one. Og kult at det funker bra i Norge. 
,NanoHendrik,2008-01-04T14:46Z,"Thnx bmwtorrents!!! Great job!

Emtec DVD+R doesn't work though (burned with Nero @1x), ImgBurn @1x gives fatal error....

Will try some A-brand dvd+r's, maybe that'll help. Anyone other suggestions? Thnx.."
,Fysle,2008-01-05T14:58Z,"I used the Verbatim DVD+R and it worked perfect. I use it on a 2004 mod 525d (E60). I dont know how to choose ""Euro speed cams"" in the car categori though, dont find such a menu. Anyone who knows where that is? Or is the  software in the car too old? Anyway, maps are perfect :) "
,PTDennis,2008-01-07T01:26Z,This is the 2007-2 European Professional DVD inc European Speed Cameras. Not the 2008. It didnÂ´t updated in my car because it is the old map. Sorry guys..
,320dat,2008-01-07T23:22Z,"Wrong. It is 2008-1. I had the 2007-1 before and this one has got new roads missing in the 2007-2. My car, a 2007 E91 with navi pro, recognized this as a new version and had to update, (turn off engine, wait, restart). You get the speed cams by choosing ""information on current location"", ""car"", ""euro speed cams"", select range and ""search"". You will then see the cams as POI's in the map.

I am happy, so should you be. By the way, i have gone through 2006-2, 2007-1, 2007-2 and now this one, changes each time."
,320dat,2008-01-07T23:24Z,"eh, sorry, correct version: I had the 2007-2 before and this one has got new roads missing in the 2007-2....."
,firataga,2008-01-10T02:44Z,"I have E60 bmw 525 2005, navigation professinol. I burn the image with nero and dvd decrypter on Platinum+ and verbatim + still did't work by my car. I get dvd read error. Somebody solution pleazzz??????"
,320dat,2008-01-10T17:10Z,"I did not use any the decrypter. I just ""doubleclicked"" on the image  file. Nero recognized it  and went directly into burne-mode. I am just an amateur so the only syggestion is to skip the decrypter and possibly burn at a lower speed."
,gm3suz,2008-01-11T19:17Z,"Should have read the instructions, spent 2 days downloading and burning to DVD to find out, it only works on a BMW navigation system. Will keep looking for the Garmin 2008 version for my Streetpilot 2620. Have a Tomtom version on my Nokia e61, for UK only. "
,firataga,2008-01-13T14:27Z,ye i now i burn't also with nero still did'nt work. somedy can tell me if it works and how they have burn't??????
,NanoHendrik,2008-01-21T20:28Z,"Does not work in (my) E46. At least, so far...

,NeedMachine,2008-02-05T20:37Z,"NanoHendrik: Try this one http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3958180/BMW_digital_Roadmap_High_2008-1, it works in my E46 with the business navi"
,Bravawatch,2008-02-11T20:54Z,"Works for me but in my Dutch language setting the CAR menu is suddenly in Spanish. The rest of the menus are in Dutch, as they should be."

,Illyr,2008-04-13T14:08Z,"HEY!

I really need some help and would strongly appriciate an answer..

I got the BMW 530i E60 -2004.
However, it does not have the NAVIGATION SYSTEM installed.
Is this the install? Or does it just add maps?
Will this even work on my car?

Thanks alot.."
,schoelli,2008-05-06T11:11Z,"1. thanx a lot for uploading this piece of gold ;)
2. works perfect in my bmw 325i e90 2005
3. will seed it for weeks (=
4. what a shame that the copied version are significant slower than the original copies.
5. i live in austria and the original german/austrian version has no speed camera option. can i enable it now with this version? i can't find any camera icons? do they actually have the speed camera option for austria?

burned it on sony dv-r with osx leopard.

@illyr: nope...if you don't have any navigation system previously installed than this update won't do anything. it's not the software, this is just the map.
@dasop: what i know is that the bmw road map prof only works for cars which have been build from 2005 to now. also not every kind of cartype from bmw is supported. sometimes they drop specific car types because of lack of compatibility"
,NorwegianGuy,2008-08-17T20:54Z,"I have BMW road map Europe high 2004-2 on a disc. If I burn Bmw road map europe 2008-1 on a disc, will it work in my car?

Thanks"
,pucok,2008-10-17T23:13Z,"Hi guys!

First of all I like to thanks for the seeders! I just downloaded and burned onto the SONY DVD-RW media and it works fine!!!! I have a BMW E46 2005 with big navi and yesterday drove me home from Brussels to Budapest in 1400 km distance!!!!
The only one problem is that I could not activate the speedcams but should include as well by the description....
Did anybody could do that?

Thanks again"
,pucok,2008-10-19T11:41Z,"Ouch! 
Now it seems that my problem is solved :-))) !!!!
Had to update the firmware on the GPS (now the latest is V.32) and lot of new fuctions became in the menu, like the speedcams.
Must do that  for everybody: much more nice interface, detailed map, more nice texts and etc etc etc"
