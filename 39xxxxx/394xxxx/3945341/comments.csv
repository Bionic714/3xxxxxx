,skidogallard,2008-02-20T05:46Z,"Thanks for the upload.

@ Razoraki:

These are 13 songs, not 13 CDs"
,bengi4life91,2008-02-23T20:41Z,THESE ARE NOT MP3'S!!!!!
,fergofrog,2008-04-03T08:36Z,"Thanks, keep seeding! Great quality."

,Welcometothetruth,2008-05-24T23:26Z,"""THESE ARE NOT MP3'S!!!!!""

wow... stupidity must be a disease...

notice the file format ""FLAC?"" it's in big letters you know.

my god people are dumb. idiots flood the internet spots like youtube, gamefaqs and now piratebay. people need to learn how to READ things before they post a question"
,5by5,2008-06-08T13:25Z,Thank you!

NO WAY "
,Fkm7b5c,2008-06-20T18:44Z,"Very good rip, no artifacts. =)"
,loominator,2008-06-28T10:26Z,"This can hardly be called 'perfect' or without artifacts.. This seems more like a conversion from a bad mp3 to FLAC... There is quite a lot of static whenever there is many sounds being made at the same time.. (using Sennheiser HD650, and it's pretty easy to hear).. This is not a direct cd flac conversion. "
,indeez,2008-07-01T14:10Z,...thanx!!
,chinkaling,2008-07-21T22:47Z,"loominator, you can hardly be called ""intelligent"" or without stupidity. I honestly don't think anyone is dumb enough to ""upconvert"" mp3 to flac; but I don't know, you're surely proving me wrong. I don't know about your nifty headphones either, but they must be shitty to produce nonexistent static. Or perhaps you are just misinterpreting crash cymbals as static?

I actually borrowed a CD and did my own EAC rip only to find that the files were exactly identical, with confidence levels of over 50 in the AccurateRip database (just 4 is considered good). So basically, you're an ass for worrying anyone that was about to or did download this torrent. You should have done what I did or at least check with a different source with a log file before putting your bullshit comment up.

Sorry for the rant, but everyone just ignore what loominator said and enjoy this great album."
,theirkenone,2008-07-26T10:34Z,"Great upload RIAA_sucks, and thanks to chinkaling too for verifying that it is good quality, although it should be common sense considering it is in flac. But then again the world is full of idiots..."
,chinkaling,2008-07-28T17:23Z,"Actually, I messed up really bad. I just realized the FLAC files I had were from a different torrent and not this one. I downloaded one song to verify, and I found that the hashes of the waves did in fact NOT match.

A quick look at the waveform structures of the songs shows that the flac files just might be upconverted from mp3 files and not the original source. I pointed the finger at the wrong idiot. And for that, sorry to all who downloaded these due to my comment and sorry to especially loominator."

i cant add them to my itunes libery!!"
,julenissen123,2008-10-22T23:57Z,"If you want proper quality you should try the other X&Y torrent with the japanese bonus track. I'm not done dl yet, but when i get it i'll seed with all i have. Try this one:

[T],PeteSapai,2009-10-27T21:04Z,"Quality seems fine to me. Also, audiochecker v2.0beta marks track 7 as ""CDDA with probability 99%"", the rest with probability 100%"
,RIAA_sucks,2011-02-24T19:15Z,"I ripped them myself from a CD using foobar2000, not sure what flac level, probably 5."
