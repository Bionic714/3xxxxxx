,XweAponX,2007-12-29T02:28Z,"Since AVG said it is a ""virus"" - Then this is probably a SAFE file.

AVG = Shit... IF this is a parasite, I'll tell you... NOT AVG."
,XweAponX,2007-12-29T03:08Z,"As far as I can see, this file is neither a virus or a parasite program... In itself.

Whether the thing performs malicous acts, I did nto see any evidence of that either.

So it is probably just a crack patch.

If it works or not I'll come back and post, but as far as AVG saying thius is a virus, I say ABG is a virus and needs to be deleted along with Norton, Symantec, Mcafee, and all that other swill of overbloated bloat programs."

,dustonio,2007-12-31T09:02Z,It seems this crack works .
