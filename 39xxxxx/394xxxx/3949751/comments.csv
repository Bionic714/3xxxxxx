,matttyger,2008-01-04T15:36Z,"AVG sucks
Norton says it's clear


thnx 6710"
,mrnobodywtb,2008-01-27T06:35Z,"clearly you suck if you believe that Norton Anti-Virus is reliable.. its a resource hog and doesn't find nearly as much as some of the better (and sometimes free) anti-viruses do.

i.e. AVG (yes, it is way better than norton), Avast, or NOD32"
