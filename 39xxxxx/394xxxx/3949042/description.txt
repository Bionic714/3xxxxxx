Regarded as Wembley's finest finale, this was the final where the best was save until last. With United competing in their third final in the late 70's and Arsenal appearing in their 4th final in the 70's (all whilst wearing yellow), the stage was set for a heavyweight showdown between two of the country's most prestigious teams in the very last final of the decade.
