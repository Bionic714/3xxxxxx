[V],Subzero!,2007-12-22T13:25Z,added the speech addon links to the description!... change -dot- to . and be happy...
,yougo2005,2007-12-24T20:39Z,"hey it works and i don't mind it not having speech but it would be cool and the links you are giving do not work...
anyway you can make a torrent of the speech and post on here.or where else can i get it...
oh i'm kinda stuck at the puppy on the roof top i think there is somekinda bug on it"
[V],Subzero!,2007-12-25T05:44Z,"links tested, they work fine, scroll the page down click on the ""free"" button, wait the little time, then it starts leeching... do this with all 3 links, but hey, open your eyes , everything the description said is the right way too...

remember >>> renaming -dot- to .                        
otherwise the links are not working....
