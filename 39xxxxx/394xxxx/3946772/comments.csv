,autoslump,2007-12-25T17:57Z,@paulyearwig: You are Welcome! May 2008 be slightly more sane than 2007. Cheers!
,svennik,2007-12-25T20:53Z,Thank you very much! I admire Hitchens so much. Does anyone know where to get hold of some Daniel Dennett in audio format?
,EvilBunny,2007-12-27T12:14Z,"Laughing at Paulyearwig's comment :) I don't think that Hitchens or Dawkins would approve but I think we get the idea.
