,deathsniper666,2008-01-18T16:41Z,"Has anyone found a working key or version for this app?  I have never had so much trouble finding a crack or serial for this prog...its crazy.  If anyone finds anything, please post something here!"
,BIoodBIade,2008-02-14T05:55Z,"yeah, even after deleting files, and crap, it reverts back to demo, but it still works, thkns"
,sil3nc3,2008-04-19T18:47Z,Damn that serial thing is getting annoying. I can't even find a plist for it!
,phaezshre,2008-12-02T15:52Z,"HAH! No...... Don't bother with it, won't work. SoundSpectrum is smart."
,nuxeh,2009-06-20T16:36Z,"This is a great torrent..
If anyone is interested, this is a simple fix to stop this from de-registering.
All you have to do is make sure you're not connected to the internet the first time you start g-force.  I switched my airport off before install, registered with the serial and then unchecked ""Check for updates on startup"" in the standalone version. After that you're sound as a pound."

,deodac,2010-03-07T11:33Z,"Found a solution to avoid the problem when installing a previous package after installing and uninstalling the trial version package 3.9.4,

It states that there's a previous version installed, although one has sent all traces of the software to trash, and prevents the installer from choosing Mackintosh HD as a destination folder.

There's TWO HIDDEN FILES in

MackintoishHD /private/var/db/receipts

1) com.SoundSpectrum.......pkg.plist
2) com.SoundSpectrum.......pkg.bom

After finding and deleting those two files, installation of a previous version package runs swell.

Don't know if it helps, but there's surely this .plist file, which has been hard to find, that maybe is messing with your license issue. Just Try and tell me later."
