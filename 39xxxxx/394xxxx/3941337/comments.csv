,quirkyqwerty,2008-01-09T03:15Z,"64 kbps

Its all lo-fi recordings, so 64 is more than enough for good audio quality"
,MonkeyCheezPants,2009-09-21T06:50Z,"The recordings are off of shortwave radio, so I guess Lo-Fi is the best way to put it. Also, the creators of the CONET project - http://www.irdial.com/conet.htm - not only allow p2p sharing of this, but encourage it. So download and seed with pride!"
