,death734,2007-12-27T17:21Z,"just as a note, i compared dimensions 1.07gb 3.1mbit 720p encode (upscaled to 1080) to these 2gb ~6mbit 1080p encodes and dimmensions looks better (i was surpised)
that could be due to the fact that dimension uses the globaltv source from canada which is better then the nbc source but i dont know. i havn't compared them to ctu rips

personally i would say 2.05gb and ~6-6.5mbit x264 is for very nice 720p encodes but not enough for 1080p"

,Da King,2008-02-02T09:49Z,Am I the only one who is experiencing that Audio is out of synch and that also the picture freezes? My system specs are certainly high enough. I've tried using Media Player Classic and Media Player and both show the same problems?
,riddleren,2008-03-27T08:48Z,Da King do you have problems with otuer 1080p videos?  or just this one..
