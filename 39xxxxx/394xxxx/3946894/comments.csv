,madmax999,2007-12-25T00:32Z,Sorry for the delay folks.  Been working on website for a client.  Bunch more to follow today and tomorrow
,robfordzine,2007-12-26T18:34Z,"Beautiful film, Thanks. Unfortunately I don't seem to be able to access the English - I'm getting only the Spanish dubbed track - and that's awful. Anyone know how to select the English?"
,madmax999,2007-12-26T19:15Z,"I use Media Player Classic (free on the internet).  You right-click on the screen while it is playing, choose Audio and it will display both audio streams, click on stream2.

MS Windows Media Player does not work the same way.  Never have been able to figure out how to change audio streams on it."
,madmax999,2007-12-26T19:18Z,"Also, MS Media player doesn't always handle the audio codecs very well.  I will be uploading ""Comanche Station"", with Randolf Scott, 1960 with Italian and English tracks.  The audio was awful in MS player and fine in Media Player. Go figure."
,bobsgirl62,2008-03-16T20:16Z,How can you burn the english version of this movie to dvd.
,shyspopey,2008-03-22T04:02Z,"VirtualDubMod a free download can be used to extract a language from an AVI file and and back it up. Then convert to DVD and burn. Have had to do this a few times. Just takes a little while to figure it all out but it works very well. Information on how to do this can be found at 
Doom9.net and other places in the internet."

Any chance of reseeding this?
A bunch of us are stuck at 91.7 %
Thanx"
,franksinatra697,2008-08-12T21:33Z,Badly needs a seed. Stuck at 98.9 for days.... please. I'll seed once I've got the full file....
,franksinatra697,2008-08-20T19:58Z,SEED NEEDED! more people joining in but nobody's going to finish until somebody seeds....
,madmax999,2008-09-19T06:22Z,Sorry for the lapse.  I've been taking care of some family business.  It is online now.
,somstar,2009-06-03T15:56Z,"Thanks madmax999 for this beautiful gem of movie. Unfortunately, guys don't seem to seed this after leeching which is pretty sad indeed. I implore you all to seed this so everyone can benefit. Once again Please SEED, SEED, SEED........."
,madmax999,2010-05-25T17:33Z,"yah, i noticed, but that is ok.  I try to rotate about 8 at a time so that in the evening and night when i can open up the bandwidth, there is some fair speed on what is there.  If one of my movies has more than 4 seeders I take it out of the rotation.  Three or four times a year i tell all the movies to seed and take out the ones that have more than 4 seeders.

Wish i could do more but life is life."
