,Beonaam,2007-12-21T04:53Z,"@ 507LTS
If you don't mind me asking... how can you tell if the audio is messed up when right now there is only one seeder?
Is that seeder you? And if it is, why do you continue seed if the audio is crap?"
,507LTS,2007-12-21T05:04Z,"I guess after you finish dl this one you can dl the audio fixed version
