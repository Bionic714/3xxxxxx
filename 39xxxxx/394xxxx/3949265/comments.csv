,chief_r_strong,2007-12-27T06:19Z,OK ... I'm just leaning this. So it would help if there is something wrong or if it's done right that you post here and let me know. 
,Space_Cowby,2007-12-27T10:41Z,you need to seed it so we can DL the file
,geezer45,2007-12-27T17:58Z,"To seed it, just d/l it from piratebay (just like when you d/l any torrent). Your client (utorrent?) will then check the files-when it gets to 100% it will move it from d/l to seeding. As long as the file has not been changed-and you have it in the same file as when you created it-it should start seeding. There are around 130 peers waiting so it should start right away."
,chief_r_strong,2007-12-28T06:38Z,"Ok... I'm not understanding a thing you are saying. But ... I'm downloading the file, which is actually a 2hr+ movie file that is on my hard drive, through the network, however the file is one the same computer I'm using to download. I hope that was what you were telling me to do. 

My question is how do I make the file available without downloading the file I already have? "
,geezer45,2007-12-28T12:35Z,"Obviously you have the movie on your hard drive in a folder. When you created the torrent, hopefully you moved the movie file into the folder you always use when d/l torrents.  You may not have it pointing to the correct folder, or have moved it or changed the name. Stop the torrent in your client, right click on it & 'open containing folder' & make sure your movie file is in that folder. If the movie is not there, put it (or copy it) back into the proper folder. Open containing folder again & see if your movie is there. If ok, then restart the torrent. OK? "
,geezer45,2007-12-28T13:02Z,"More simply, if you d/l the torrent from 
piratebay  & it does not immediately start
to check it in your client & move it to seeding
(completed)-the movie is not in the correct
folder. Other peers torrent clients cannot find it.
The actual movie has to be in the folder the
torrent is pointing to. OK?"
