"Tangines Scales is the second release out of the Antique Dream Land series. An interesting mixture of studio, live and soundtrack work will take you on to a strange journey passing landscapes of sound sculpturing which probably couldn?t have been produced by anybody else but Tangerine Dream.
Enjoy the ride with an ultra fresh remastering and take a chance to escape a few minutes from today's gagaland."
