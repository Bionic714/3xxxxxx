,Amrassirfala,2008-01-02T03:05Z,"You just put it in a random folder (Maybe create a new folder and name it ""Games"" like me). When you open the folder on your phone, you just open the game and it installs it and you can play. Easy ^^ Haven't downloaded this game pack yet, but i have another one which worked this way :)"
