This is a set of scanned game cards for the Eye of Judgment Playstation 3 game. For some marketing ploy, the game supports two players, but only comes with enough cards for one player!

The cards, are easy to counterfeit, and these 300dpi scans are of the complete starter deck (English), simply use a colour printer, preferably photo print capable, and create a duplicate deck!

I'd be interested in seeing 'hi-res' scans of other decks for this game, I've only been able to find low-res ones at the moment, and not all the text is legible on the low-res cards :(
