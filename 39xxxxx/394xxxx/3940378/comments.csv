they dont sell any of these in Warren, Ohio where i am at!"
,falkies,2009-06-06T20:33Z,they are on ebay or amazon or other sites.  I own them but will not be ripping them because they are easily available for purchase
,RyanTGunnz,2010-01-02T20:40Z,"@ falkies, While they are available on ebay and amazon, they go for about 100$ a season. That is insane, and not easily available to anyone whos not loaded. if you have the ability to upload I know it would be appreciated by a lot of people."
,RyanTGunnz,2010-01-02T20:44Z,P.S. They dvds have been discontinued. On amazon the going rate for the first three seasons combined is 670$
,falkies,2010-02-03T18:04Z,thanks for informing me - I will work on uploading the other seasons - they will be available soon here
,mcye90,2010-02-07T15:39Z,"hi, I was just wondering if wmv could be played in vlc or I need to download some other program, tnx"
,falkies,2010-02-18T23:28Z,"wmv files can be played in windows media player - not sure if vlc will play them, but it's worth a shot!"
,falkies,2010-03-13T02:20Z,"well I uploaded season 1 and people only leeched, never seeded, so I deleted it.  I will NOT be uploading seasons 1-3 because people do not appreciate it!"
