,vandark,2007-12-23T22:39Z,"I have downloaded this but when I try to extract it it stops on graphics at 99% and just freezes my computer, it's not a virus because I ran the scan but it might be damaged... can you fix this??"
,reubes1,2007-12-24T11:53Z,"Something might have stuffed up while you were downloading. The only thing you can do I think is try downloading it again.

No one else has said anything so I assume it worked fine for everyone else."
