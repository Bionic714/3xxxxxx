If you find yourself capped at a certain download speed, that's because I work on a shared network and can't hog our house's bandwidth

If there's no seeds, more likely than not my computer is off or I've been nice to my housemates and stopped seeding so they can use the network, too. Just wait around and/or shoot an email to torrents@joshdb.com"

TWAT!"

,kinggimp,2008-06-01T04:09Z,"instead of calling him a dickhead, maybe ask nicely?  so how about please re-up the whole album? PUHLEEZE!! :)"
,severedembrace,2008-06-25T20:18Z,"Please seed, these guys are good."
,Wingnutt,2008-10-19T06:12Z,Hey thanks Josh !
,pumbster,2009-02-11T10:44Z,why did you decide to upload it in the first place if you're not willing to correct it when you made a mistake?
