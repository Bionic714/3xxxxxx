,Smelly_Granny,2008-05-21T01:47Z,"Very nice album, of some very talented people. Who said Hip Hop has no talent, huh?!

Anyway, nothing wrong with the quality as far as i can tell, all the tracks are smooth and sleeky. The only thing i could ask for is a higher Bitrate (its at 192kbit), but i could say that about most of the music on BT.

Thanks hugely for the upload!"
