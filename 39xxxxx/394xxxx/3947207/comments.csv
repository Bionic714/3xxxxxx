,ddelrealg,2008-03-24T04:34Z,many thanx for this
,WogerWabbit,2008-11-28T00:36Z,"Thanks for this. 

Is this the version of the show that has the janitor / invisible drumkit sketch at the end?

Some releases do not have this (a shame too, because it's awesome)."
,isaaclimdc,2009-02-22T08:03Z,"Please seed, this is awesome!"
,Semprini_Nighthunter,2009-07-28T10:03Z,"Unfortunately this doesn't have the drum sketch at the end. But it does have 3 sketches I haven't seen before(at least on the USA version tape); 
""Elementary Dating"", ""Guys after the Game"" and ""Thomas, Richard and Harold"".  Great stuff, thanks for the upload, I haven't seen this since my friend ""lost"" my old tape."
