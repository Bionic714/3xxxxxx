,madhouse76,2008-07-10T00:02Z,"Mijmanxx, whatever. The _ds.store file is a file windows can perfectly list but just can't read, like any .ini file on Mac.

tom1181, don't download it then. :)

Scormio, maybe restart the torrent (delete torrent + data) and preferably use a client like mtorrent. Should work, especially seen the popularity of this torrent. ;)"
,Scormio,2008-07-19T17:38Z,"yeah, it was actually my shitty internet connection giving me problems."
,hax0rth0r,2008-08-14T11:13Z,"You're missing ""One"" it was only on the Orange County soundtrack ;)"
,Namtab2.0,2008-08-14T21:59Z,"This is effing awesome, I already had most of the foo fighter albums, so I just didn't download the 4 I already had :D...one thing though madhouse76 you definitely need to add world for echoes silence patience and grace. Its a japanese bonus track and a really good song...took me forever to download though, but that was back in the day when I was using ares :D."
,musicsmylifeman,2008-09-13T04:38Z,"hey, any one know what the kbps on this is?"

,PeppersMagik,2008-11-13T19:57Z,The quality is 192 kbit/s
,ryandude,2009-01-13T10:51Z,if your stuck at 99% you can just remove the extension the torrent puts on it. Google how to show known file extensions. then you will be able to just delete the bc! (for bitcomet) extension. done
,barakone,2009-01-14T09:36Z,seed please     thnx
,Theil9220,2009-02-07T19:08Z,Seed please
,Lexiconic,2009-02-10T17:42Z,"Haha. I broke 830kbps.
Nice.
(not unprecedented, but pleasant.)"
,Lexiconic,2009-02-10T17:47Z,"Scratch that.
1.2Mbps.
This torrent is just limited by your download speed."
,RGS42,2009-02-16T21:18Z,"please don't waste your time on this quality less than 2 out of ten try http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4581751/Foo_Fighters-_Discography
its a bigger file but theres three different file types for each album and there all 9/10 quality and the bonus cd from the colour and the shape is included"
,tjc010,2009-02-24T01:31Z,How the hell are u guys getting 1.2 mb/s?!? i shit my pants if i see anything over 200 kb/s and i got 10 megabyte cable connection so that aint the problem. other wise great download. 7 albums under 600 megs is a god send.
,volver04,2009-05-03T08:24Z,Newbie here. How do I choose which albums to download and which to discard? Thanks.
,kluba,2009-05-04T17:41Z,seeeeed! XD

Nice Download, Thanks Seeders, All The Albums Sound Great madhouse76 :) --- Word Of Advice, If Your Using A Router, It Helps If You Open A Custom Port For uTorrent Or Whatever You Use...You""ll See A Major Increase In Download Speed. Also It Helps If You Download A Torrent With Over 30 - 40 Seeders..."

,Badgi,2009-09-27T11:44Z,"I love Foo Fighters, can't wait for their greatest hits. Got it on pre-order.

Great Upload, thanks. :)"
,mc_homes,2009-12-02T21:23Z,"@volver - i would get them in this order: the colour and the shape, in your honor, self titled, there's nothing left to lose, skin and bones (live acoustic album), echoes silence patience and grace, and finally one by one.  i am a huge foo fan, so i would consider this a good idea of what to get first :D"
,Fighterlegend,2009-12-12T16:45Z,"Looks great, but it's not even starting to download..

I'm going to wait another 15 minutes, and see if it budges.."
,Sweath,2010-05-17T04:37Z,Thanks for the Upload madhouse76 :D. I thank the seeders too.
,thevaultkeeper,2010-06-20T19:33Z,"Thanks Madhouse76, great up!!

==TVK=="
,isakth,2010-11-22T04:04Z,"Concerning network speeds in the last posts... your ""10 megabyte"" connection is probably a 10 megabit connection = 1.25 megabytes. 1 byte = 8 bits.

Almost any wireless connection will tell you the speed is 54 megabits but that is just between you and the router.

Some ISPs do their best to limit bandwidth for p2p/torrents, but generally forwarding a port in your router to your computer for the torrent client helps speeds as someone said."
