,anuskasvo,2007-12-26T23:09Z,"Whoa, you don't know how long I've been searching for these, thanks a lot!"
,pflagger,2007-12-28T13:13Z,"I just remembered that i converted some of the season 3 second half episodes too, if anybody cares.  Episodes 14, 15, 18 and 19 were .ogm files.  I think they were XviD; I just repacked them in .avi and recoded the audio to mp3.  Episode 22 was an .mp4 file; I think I recoded that one.  And episode 16 was an ASF file."

,DigChrono,2009-08-26T06:22Z,"kinda wish there was a full set, like every episode from the same source
but this rocks, I'll D/L (and seed forever, like I do with giant torrents) as soon as I have 12 GB free......
so a few months! :P"
,propensity,2009-12-21T14:51Z,"Can anyone provide a reseed?
