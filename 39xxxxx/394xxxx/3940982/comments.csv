,ottawabroker,2007-12-21T08:13Z,Great work as usual keep it up...
,stylishirish,2007-12-21T11:05Z,"quality is excellent! - both a/v

but the movie wasnt my thing - i mean, eragon was a good flick and all... but this has cheesy poor acting and a flimsy over done and drawn out storyline - even for a fantasy... i see little girls and boys who sit alone at lunchtime drawing mythological creatures very much enjoying this particular piece of theatrical fantasia... if this is your bag then you must know that i do not mean to steal your sunshine by any means!

...just a little warning to those perhaps expecting something else - skip it or get real nice and lifted before watching"
,Neijek,2007-12-24T01:32Z,Is it normal that you can not see translation for the korian parts in the movie or am I missing a codec of some kind ? 
,Bafucin,2007-12-24T02:15Z,"Yes, the movie might look good when you watch pictures or trailer. But it sucks monkey."

,Anomoly2mankind,2008-01-17T03:46Z,"Good quality, but worst movie i ever seen.  The story line sucked only good part was the battle seen."
,lane75,2008-01-19T11:14Z,Bullet proof respect to the FXG team for the effort of bringing us this release. Too bad this movie is a total disaster. This is a horrifying example that a big budget with lots of cool special effects is ABSOLUTELY worthless if you don't have the story and the actors. Worst movie I've ever seen ... 
,pyro_1,2008-01-22T00:27Z,this movie suckes ass :P if you would ask me if you should watch it it would be a wast of time ... still thanx for the movie your doing great work
,replay64,2008-01-23T15:16Z,"Don't waste your time for this shit!!!
This movie really sucks!!!!"

,Robonus,2008-01-25T13:40Z,this movie is so bad that i recommend it! Just sit with some friends and a few beers and have a laugh
,staticthing,2008-01-31T02:37Z,"Great video & sound.  I actually liked the movie.  Could have been an amazing movie, but over all it wasn't too bad."
,2toka,2008-02-08T14:51Z,OMG!!!! FUCKING CRAPPY MOVIE.... OH SHIT... FUCKING BAD MOVIE... NICE DVDRIP.. BUT THE MOVIE SUCKS COCK!!!!!!
,stylishirish,2008-03-03T12:47Z,"@ the bastard who said that an 8yo would have enjoyed eragon (implying i was 8)-- wtf are you doing looking at a 'dragon wars' torrent anyway

look, all im saying is that this movie is a total piece of stinky dogshit -- i thank fxg for the quality rip as per usual ... HOWEVER...

please STOP SEEDING this horrible horrible movie -- it does not deserve a top100 spot on the bay.... far more movies from recent to past that should be looked at

again - this movie will steal time from your life and make you feel bad about yourself for having watched it - it is total garbage that could have been something good

,^eRrOR^,2008-03-25T15:27Z,"I watched this last night and let me say WOW!, loved it, fantastic film, snd and vid quals are great, only down side was the sub titles, I had to search for the right ones for this version but the link here points you in the right direction to find them (only 2 on the site and the one linked to here is the wrong one so search is fast)

Thanks for this, I voted for you"
,dopeyrules420,2008-04-17T21:19Z,How do i get the subtitle thing to do it's thing in the movie???????????????
,gelenisse,2008-05-14T05:46Z,"I wish I would have read these comments before I went to target and bought this movie because it fucking sucks! special effects are cool and all but the story, the actors and the overall presentation sucks! do not download this, please I'm begging you!! It will be a waste of your life watching this!"
,SpiderGav,2008-05-20T14:33Z,"bet u all wouldnt want ur mothers 2 hear u cussin this bad...miserable little fuckwits (and yea my mum does hear me use that kinda language)
Film is good..not awesome but good..special effects are real good, the dragons look awesome :) :) only thing that lets it down is a poor story line but lets be honest, we all wanna watch it just for the dragons, just a shame there wasnt so much dragon on dragon action...dragon Vs military is good tho :)
stop complaining, watch it for what it is, a good cgi dragon fest"
,lumbix,2008-05-22T20:47Z,i wasted 1:30 of my life watching this piece of shit. I'm pretty sure my 7-yo brother rights better stories than this when he's doodling in class. Writer should be shot.
,theRealKarmine,2008-06-08T04:40Z,"bunch of mindless drivel an no comments on quality.

""Hey Ketil84 Fackin n1!!! 8-)
for link ta subbies bin tearing me hair out after d/ling belting copy wid nowt but wong tong chit chat in the best bits cheers fella.""

what the fuck does that mean?  do people really talk like that?"
,theRealKarmine,2008-06-08T12:26Z,also it says on the bloody subtitle download page that its not for this torrent.  its for FXM release
,S][N,2008-06-28T07:50Z,"Good quality.
Missing subtitles which sucks.

Imo. Don't waste 700MB downloading this movie..

It's crap...it truly is. Shocking acting, shocking dialogue..

Only good thing about it is the graphics...but still doesn't make 700MB of downloading worth it.

Wait for DVD, and waste $2 if you must really see this."
,MageHeart,2008-09-28T15:38Z,"Wait. You say don't waste time downloading it, yet you said spend $2 on seeing it? That makes no sense."
,tikkig0d,2008-10-19T04:03Z,its funny cause right when i was about to dl this i found it just started on the sci-fi channel..lol
,wolfbeast,2010-02-07T20:52Z,"If you like dragons, there's no reason not to download this. Good rip, nice looking dragons.. who needs in in-depth story? :)

If you don't like dragons... then why are you looking at this torrent?"
,yelloo,2010-10-11T09:17Z,Thanks FXG_team.
,malhalla,2011-05-22T17:44Z,"I understand that this movie is really bad. Thanks for the heads up, trailer made me suspicious. However, I will download and watch this. Can say i'ts strange i'v not seen it before, yet the reason is obvious, it's crap. For now, I sit with dragon hunger after watching Eragon, so D-Wars will have to do."
,malhalla,2011-05-22T20:49Z,"Scrap that. Movie was awesome!

A = 7

V = 10

M = 9

T = 5

No subtitles. Highly advice you to find some if you don't know both Korean and English.

I guess movie is hated because all the western might (American in this case) Army, Police and whatnot. Is totally owned by a handful of japs. Not real? Ok. let me put it like this. In a futuristic thought America will make ""Ironman"" to dominate crime. The Koreans make a army of ironmen and roll over pity ignorants.

There is nothing wrong with this movie, and there is nothing wrong with Eragon movie. Compare the movie to books and compare the comparison to your intellect.

I write to much? No. Trying to fill this garbage bin called internet with some sense. I'm to say that after double posting this? hehe. QQ"
,kingjoser,2012-07-09T11:24Z,"For all the people saying the movie was terrible and this and that, you guys are idiots. Ok, the movie does seem a little cheap at times and most of the actors are crap, except the lead actor guy, he can act. Anyway, the first 3/4 of the movie was ok, but the last 15 minutes is the FUCKIN SHIT!!! I bought this movie for $20 just because of the last 15 minutes. The Dragon looks AAAWWEESSOOMMEE!! It's like fuckin art! Really aweson. Last battle seen with the dragon is the tightest thing ive ever seen, CGI-wise, in any movie. Dont listen to the other fuckers, download this shit. And it deserves more credit that the critics and these people give it. Awesome movie"
