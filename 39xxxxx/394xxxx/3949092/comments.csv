,NeoMouser,2007-12-27T08:42Z,"The movie will cover SG-1's attempt to recover the ""Ark of Truth"", a piece of Alteran technology developed before the Ancients left for the Milky Way. In an attempt to prevent the Ori and their followers rising to power, a device was created that could essentially ""brainwash"" individuals, for instance Priors, into believing whatever ""truth"" was programmed into the device. The Ancients' non-interference policy and belief in free will resulted in the device never being used. Even though the promise of Ascension promised by Origin is a lie, the freedom to believe was something the Alterans ultimately decided they did not have the right to restrict. [8]"
