,Dalvenjia,2008-07-24T19:13Z,"Anyone found Spanish subtitles for this rls?

Zeus, could you rip the subs off of the DVD (if any)?

have tried every sub on opensubtitles.org and none match. even after syncing at the begining it unsyncs some minutes after"
,Dalvenjia,2008-07-24T19:19Z,"And for the ones having trouble with codecs I would recommend K-Lite Mega Codec Pack 4.0.0, it
can be found on:
http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm

Just install with the standard settings and you will have no codec trouble again

And the media Player Classic on that pack is hell of a player too, it plays even FLV's along with te most popular formats XviD, DivX, Mpg, Mpeg, and it goes on.

Good Luck"
