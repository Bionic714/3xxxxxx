,tomreedtoon,2007-12-23T02:31Z,Okay...now could you or someone with the whole torrent go back and reseed the ORIGINAL Scrooge Pak? We've been stuck at 25 percent for the last four days!
,JiffyJif,2007-12-23T16:34Z,"The seed was stuck at  24 - 25% for the original Scrooge.Pak.2007.9isFine.JiffyJif.DSRG.torrent. 
I have removed that torrent. Sorry for zee trouble. I crashed during the initial seed a week ago & just got back yesterday. I thought some peeps grabbed the initial anyway cause I seeded over ratio 3.0 & hoped they would continue it, but... 

Anyways, the Scrooge Fix contains 2 avi's that is seeding right now. I will put up another new torrent for the remaining 7:
Scrooge.Pak.2007.7isHeaven.JiffyJif.DSRG, hopefully sometime today (Look 4 it). 
U may have it all before Xmas yet!

,keithdylan,2007-12-26T15:26Z,Anyone else having problems unpacking this?  I only get empty files.
,sidd2v,2007-12-26T22:14Z,I to only get empty files. How can we fix this?
,JiffyJif,2007-12-27T05:55Z,"Ummm, if u got thee rar files, u used thee pswd? 
Problem solved? HNY!"
,keithdylan,2007-12-27T16:24Z,"I AM using the password, it will not open at all w/o the password.  It unpacks, but the files do not have a file type and it says they have 0 bytes."
,sidd2v,2007-12-27T18:27Z,I used the password HNY I only get 2 empty files.
,JiffyJif,2007-12-28T00:15Z,"HNY = Happy New Year. That is not the pswd. If you had bothered to read the torrent comments or even googled, ""Scrooge Pak password"" u would not have problems. 101: Unrar, let finish, now put pswd, then click extract...wheres the ""easy"" button?. HNY!!"
,keithdylan,2007-12-28T01:10Z,I'm using the right password.  I've done RAR files hundreds of times.  I still get empty files.
,JiffyJif,2007-12-28T10:28Z,"keithdylan, try changing the folder name to: Scrooge.Pak.Fix instead of Scrooge_Pak_Fix,
then try. Let me know. Other than that; I just tried it me self & its A-OK. HNY! "
,keithdylan,2007-12-28T14:45Z,Tried that and it didn't work.  I think it is the * at the end of the file names in the folder.  I think the .AVI* screws up the unpacking.  I can't believe I'm the only one with this problem.  I tried unpacking it on 2 computers with different versions of WINRAR.
,DennyLori,2007-12-28T21:43Z,"Keithdylan, I Am Having The Same Problem. I Only Get Empty Files. I've Try Everything I Could Think Of?????????????????"
,keithdylan,2007-12-29T06:51Z,"Use this program:

www.izarc.org

It did it for me. "
,JiffyJif,2007-12-29T17:41Z,"keithdylan, thanks for the:

http://www.izarc.org/"
,sidd2v,2007-12-31T00:28Z,"Ok I downloaded this 3 times. I used izarc as keith suggested I only got one file 1923. I had no problem with 7isheaven. I know the pw is not HNY, my notebook jumped back a line when I was typing.
You shouldn't assume people need a easy button because they are having problems. i took me 2 days to download the 3rd time. You people need to seed when you are done. Not get and run. i'm done."
,otootooto,2008-01-16T02:07Z,The colon character in the filenames is causing the problems.
,scroogenut,2008-11-25T20:10Z,Anyone able to seed this please?  Thanks and Merry Christmas!!
,LiteSpd-DMc,2008-12-15T14:16Z,Seed Please
,zombeatle,2008-12-24T23:14Z,I am trying to re-author this now - I have the 1923 Scrooge and 1926 Old Scrooge (a reissue of 1913 Scrooge). I hope to have it up and available by Christmas morning 2008.
