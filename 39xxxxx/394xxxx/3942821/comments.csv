,scottyarch,2007-12-21T22:15Z,"I'm guessing the size means this is a full rip that includes the boot disk.

Is anyone else getting an error saying, ""Unregistered Torrent""?"
,antamony,2007-12-22T03:21Z,""" chabak at 2007-12-22 01:20 CET:
jeez, i hate those un-pro ppl...""

...and many of us don't care much for whiners complaining about someone else being ""un-pro"" when they have NEVER uploaded anything.

You should demand a refund ""chabak"""
,avincent,2007-12-22T07:42Z,dudes...the torrent is working...and d/ling it right now and will seed it until 12.22.11PM PST
,psykozz,2007-12-22T17:04Z,"Hello guys!

You can find it in SMARTORRENT...
It's a french tracker and you need to register to this site but it works fine!
There is 24 seeders at this time for 38 leechers.
I suppose this torrent was uploaded in here first.

,Dizaztor,2007-12-25T09:11Z,"Wow haha, went to sleep and i saw 2 seeders, came back and i see 227 :)"
,antamony,2007-12-25T13:37Z,"@chabak (and others): the torrent has two trackers listed. One is for smartorrent, and the other is piratebay. I do not know about transmission, but in uTorrent, if you right-click on the torrent, select ""properties"", it will show which trackers are used. In uTorrent, there was not the necessary empty line required between trackers (so they show as separate trackers).

You can either insert the line, or delete the smartorrent tracker (since it really isn't a valid tracker.

HTH"
,antamony,2007-12-25T13:40Z,"Don't know why, feeling Christmasy I guess, but seeded overnight until a couple hundred seeders showed up.

Hope that helps everyone."
,zofo,2007-12-26T23:13Z,Thanks!
,wildjoker2k,2007-12-27T06:06Z,"it will take me 166 days to download this, can we please seed this. THANK YOU"
,masterbluestar,2007-12-27T23:19Z,"Works. But good knows why this piece of shit is 1.9 GB (!) Why? 

I'm amazed at a small utility DVD taking up 1.9 GB of a DVD. What for? What on earth is on this disc? I'm sick and tired of all these developers robbing me of storage space. Why does a simple application take up 100-200 MB of space? That's ridiculous! Why can't a simple thing be done in thsi day and age where if I'm on an English-USA Mac, the application installed on this Mac should only contain ""English.lproj"" files within the package of the application and not 12 other foreign language versions which bloat it up to 200 MB?"
,mcflack,2008-01-01T09:47Z,"Please seed! I've got 1.7 of 1.96 GiB and now it's stalled. C'mon folks, please seed this . . .

,ShadowX96,2008-01-11T23:53Z,can somebody explain how to actully run this torrent coz i cant get it to work my mac says the disc is unreadable  (master image)
,ben boyd,2008-01-14T09:50Z,"burn the .toast file using Disk Utility onto a DVD.

works well, thanks."
,atlpoubelle,2008-01-23T01:27Z,"come on ! get this one : http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3986641
Better..."
,vasicp,2008-06-30T07:39Z,"to answer MasterBluestar (""...But good knows why this piece of shit is 1.9 GB (!) Why?"")

This DVD is bootable. It contains the entire Mac OS X. When you boot from it, you get full graphical user interface.

Obviously, when you put the disc in your Mac that is already running, you have a choice to install the application onto your hard disk. This will be significantly smaller than 2GB.

As for languages, there are many people (indeed, many countries) that are bi- and multi-lingual. While every Mac must have a primary language, many of them allow use of multiple languages. I don't want single language support in any of my applications (including drive utilities). 200MB is pocket lint these days. You can't be seriously complaining about that???!!"
