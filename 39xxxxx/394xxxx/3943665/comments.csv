[T],Artleo,2007-12-22T12:21Z,This must be terribly compressed. 
,Innocent-Vincent,2007-12-22T13:52Z,"It's the main movie only, which is compresseed to about 60 % of original size. I think the quality is OK on a 42"" screen, but its up to each of you do judge. At least it is for free."
,sgnukie,2007-12-22T15:16Z,Is this the director's cut?
,RoNxXx_,2008-01-02T00:53Z,"Apparently, the retail DVD was made from a really crappy source (almost VHS quality).

Refer to this -- http://imdb.com/title/tt0093389/board/nest/72474496

So when you watch this - it's might be crap. It's not the encoder's fault.

Gonna have to wait till they release a better & proper retail version... or try to catch it on tv/cable."

Criterion's brand new 4-disc edition of this epic is already available for preorder. I think it's going to be a must have."
,sanjuro_61,2008-02-26T21:08Z,"Vittorio Storaro cut the image from the original 2.35:1 to a crappy 2.00:1 for the Criterion Edition.
Well, Criterion's image maybe better... but we have a cropped crap.

A Gaumont DVD9 version would be the BEST!"
