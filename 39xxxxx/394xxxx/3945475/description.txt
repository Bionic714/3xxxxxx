This upload contains a text version and the audio book version re-upped after dividing the original download into chapters. My thanks to the original uploaders of these files which I consider essential in gaining an understanding the economic motivation and methodology of the human caused strife. 

Mr. Perkins\' job for several decades was essentially to talk third world countries into loans from the IMF and the World Bank that they would not be able to pay back and thus become become perpetual debtors. Conditions of these loans generally included which U.S. companies they must pay to do the work the loans were granted for and later restructuring their national economies, always at devastating consequences to their citizens, when inevitable default loomed. 

In other words he was the point man for loan sharking on an international scale.
