,spankbot,2008-03-20T09:27Z,"Just remember that this is basically considered a complete fabrication.  One famous critic wrote, ""This man is a frothing conspiracy theorist, a vainglorious peddler of nonsense, and yet his book, Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, is a runaway bestseller!"""

,Greeno225,2008-06-17T20:25Z,I love how socialists point their fingers at everyone but themselves.
,MattDWeed,2008-08-10T22:37Z,"Thanks.

There appears to be a few audio gaps in the preface. Nothing important, but a little weird. 

I will check out Hegemony or Survival by Noam Chomsky, thanks for the advice ""Diceman_"""
,amazingpinball,2008-11-10T22:08Z,"Another must read is The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein. From the looks of this one, that one will go hand in glove. The veracity of that book is certainly not in question. And Greeno225 - could you make any more of an ignorant and bigoted statement? "
