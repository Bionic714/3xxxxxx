,Palmer640,2008-07-11T23:25Z,"wow... learn how to rip as an .ISO file.

why would you even bother posting an encrypted movie on here??
look into ""DVD Santa"" and repost this torrent as .ISO and then maybe I'll download it."
,nightsongz2,2008-07-20T11:21Z,"Excellent torrent...thank you! Burned and plays beautifully...nicely done. As for the dude above me, I have no idea why he is bitching...he's probably a newbie who can only burn ISO files. As far as encrypted...he's clueless...this torrent is your typical VOB & IFO files that dvd's actually use...nothing encrypted about it. As I said, it burned and plays perfectly...thanks again!!"
,Kiiiiiiiiiim,2008-08-21T17:13Z,"These files are just what's normally inside the .iso of a DVD-movie file.. 
Easy to burn, and works like a charm.. =) 

Thank you.."
