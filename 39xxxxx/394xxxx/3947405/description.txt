Yes yes, the 747X has already been released a while ago..but this one is different. Wildmans and I present you the ultimate FSX Christmas gift: the PMDG 747-400X without any "difficult" installation/cracking instructions. Simply install the plane using the EnableButton program, replace one single file (all explained in the install.txt) and fly. Yes it is that easy!
