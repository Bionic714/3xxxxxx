,4X-AXG,2007-12-26T19:59Z,"ah sorry about that, I don't even have FSX installed..I admit I assumed the .dll file had to go to the modules directory

,Husky42,2007-12-27T10:53Z,"Look this file does not take an idiot to install.

Use Enable. Install the freaking plane. Then Go to:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\PMDG

In that folder you see dlls - Copy the PMDGOptions.dll into that folder and overwrite.

Ta DUH your fucking done. 

Thanks to erikrock for posting this file.

4X-AXG is a thief who steals other peoples releases. This file Originated from Wings of Silence. 

Please do not support these TPB Postings. Unless they come from the original purchasers and team that cracked them.

All you do is feed the ego of thieves."
,Husky42,2007-12-27T11:09Z,"BTW - What 4X-AXG does is like Fairlight stealing something from Razor or Deviance. 

This would not happen within groups,  it is about competition. All 4X-AXG has managed to do was alienate himself as a non team player and thief.

This would not have been accepted years ago. A child to the game 4X-AXG will continue to steal. But be aware, he has never released a file that was not released elsewhere first. 

He has never purchased and sold, or donated to help a cause.  He is the lowest of the lowest when it comes to file sharers and in no way deserves any form of respect. He does not even know how to give appropriate credit."
,apncka,2007-12-27T11:53Z,what about level-D 767 for FSX ?

Enlighten us, or me at least and tell me what Wings of Silence are and where I can get to them and I will come grab stuff there, otherwise, I'm gonna get it from where I can and if it's a file uploaded by someone who stole it from someone else, so be it!! "

,4X-AXG,2007-12-27T15:10Z,"haha this file originated from WoS? that's funny..I'm sure it has appeared on WoS by now, but me and Wildmans released this on usenet and TPB..that's it

oh and erikrock? seriously? he's been the one who has been providing me with a lot of 'private' or 'VIP' add-ons all along..I am the one who is supposed to thank him, not you guys ;-)"
,Panodilo,2007-12-27T17:17Z,"A poem about gayviation - by Panodilo
---------------------------------------------

I was on finals, into a wintry O'hare
Lined up gloriously on the motherfucking slope
Suddenly I felt my co-pilot's Jim's stare
I offered my crotch for Jim to grope

The passengers screamed in collective fear
as we plowed into the snows of December
Jim's hard cock in my hairy rear
Oh, tis' a night to remember"

This is the one posted in TPB bt wildmans,thanks to him.
New about this one does not corrupt the CFG.file and is easier to use,just after install run the enable button and copy the DLL to your modules and presto. Enjoy

So stop fucking around. Thx 4X-AXG."
,4X-AXG,2007-12-27T19:03Z,ahh now what do ya know..WoS 'stole' it from me! not that I care..sharing is sharing. they can 'steal' stuff from me just as I can 'steal' stuff from them :) hope the WoS kids have fun with this one ;-)
,4X-AXG,2007-12-27T20:40Z,"LOL oh now you are erik all of a sudden eh
come on man admit it, it's fun to rat out on WoS ;-) take credit for your work erik :D"
,loggie,2007-12-28T02:44Z,"i know im a noob in this area..but what is WoS ???
thx ..or is it forbidden to talk about it"
,Panodilo,2007-12-28T06:27Z,"WoS is a little group, or a circle jerk, that I started about a year ago. The idea was that I would buy addons and have them cracked in return. I bought stuff for probably 3000 euros.

Then some elements within WoS wanted a change in leadship so they leaked some of the addons I had procured with the serials that came with them. It wasn't long before Eaglesoft, Flight1 and PMDG fired off email after email with lawsuit threats. I bought three padded envelopes and scraped some nut crust from my ball sack and sealed it in with a fart and sent of to the developers. Ron Hamilton was not pleased. 

Then, without my consent, they changed the name of my outfit from Wings of Sodomy to Wings of Silenze. I cried that day. Eventually I left WoS because I was accused of a number of things, but the most offensive thing was that they suggested I was homosexual which is a lie. I have never been a gay, and as for that plainclothes cop in the airport mens' room, I only asked him for the time."
,stiffeg,2007-12-28T11:05Z,"Thanks!

It works now!

,slugga,2007-12-28T16:19Z,Hehe 4X-AXG - you have uploaded so much good stuff here so I thought it was okay to post that msg .. anywayz thz a lot :-)
,loggie,2007-12-28T17:01Z,thx Panodilo for tihs explanation =)
,globalair01,2007-12-28T20:23Z,"Thanks 4x for another great upload!

Any chance of an SP2 crack. I tried Accel and it doesn't work on my laptop, whereas normal FSX does?!

Thanks again!"
,palmofsweden,2007-12-28T23:36Z,loggie: Panodilo is a joker!
,Husky42,2007-12-29T10:59Z,"4X-AXG why do you not admit that you were relatively new to WOS when you started to steal from the site?

You continuously post WOS here and take credit that it is your own. 

In regards to pondequeer - He has/had never had any thing to do with WOS. Just another lose.

TBH I do not think some posters would have issues with the fact that 4X-AXG post stuff if he would just leave the original NFO and credits in the files, the fact that he does not is disrespectful to the original sharers. 

Everything yes, is illegal in the long run, the the little sense of respect for original shares by groups is tossed out the window.  Nobody ever things to say thanks to the guy that actually purchased the item and provided the serial, or the original crack (remember these cracks from dedicated members of WOS) One of those being Wildman.  I think if 4X-AXG kept the nfo's in tact there would be less issue amongst people. 

Some of thesee torrents have saved my ass, but just remember guys 4X-AXG is only able to share maybe 5% of what WOS has to offer."
,loggie,2007-12-29T12:47Z,"right...but now i kknow what WoS is..i didnt know that that is a forum and I didnt know anything about it ..so he helped me a bit =)
"
,4X-AXG,2007-12-29T16:30Z,"sigh..

1. I have been in this 'business' since the end of 2003; as far as I know, WoS was created after that

2. I don't see a problem with me not giving credits to WoS as they won't give me credit as well. This 747 was shared at WoS (which again, is fine by me) with my name erased from the install.txt. Again, fine by me, but don't complain I'm removing your names as well.

3. Wildmans is NOT active, nor has he ever been, at WoS. He's not active at TPB, WickedFriends, WoS, not anywhere.

4. Good holidays :-)"
,rentacow,2007-12-29T22:10Z,"It looks like the EnableButton program doesn't work with Vista. I run the program after starting the installation .exe but the ""Next"" arrow is still un-clickable. Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong, or have alternative installation instructions?

I have Vista and it works fine!

Before you click on the installprogram of the plane and the enable button you must right click on both of them and check the kompatible for WNDOWS XP-SP2. DO IT WITH BOTH OF THEM.

I've that problem and I found the problem. The 2d cockpit was 100% transparent, so it didn't appear. You can solve that by going to FSX -> Options -> settings ->Display -> aircraft tab and put 2-D panel transparency at 0%.

This is the correct install instructions:

1. Start the installation from PMDG747_400_FSX.exe

2. When installation process reaches page with validation button start EnableButton.exe program.

3. Point mouse over ""Next"" button and click. Finish installation process.

4. Copy the included cracked pmdgoptions.dll to fsx/pmdg/dlls

5. Fly!


be sure to start the .exe files as administrator!

,StephenWX2,2008-06-27T13:31Z,"whats involved with going to V2.10? is it just a matter of installing and re-applying the crack or am I going to have to re-crack it all over again?

if its the latter does anyone have a patched 2.10 installer? or crack for it?"
,StephenWX2,2008-06-27T13:35Z,"regarding the blank screens experience by people its usually incorrect application of the crack, in FS9 I used a registry edit and added a line into the Aircraft.cfg otherwise I'd get the same deal, uninstall, check your DLL.XML in the same directory as your FSX.CFG file and go through a Re-install also don't forget if using vista to make sure its all installed as administrator and that the files cane write correctly into the directories."

If you are using: Windows Vista or Windows 7, you HAVE TO RUN ENABLEBUTTON as an ADMINISTRATOR.

You can do this by right clicking on the enablebutton program, and choosing 'run as an administrator'.

Then, you can run the install program and the 'next' button should be working on the registration page."
