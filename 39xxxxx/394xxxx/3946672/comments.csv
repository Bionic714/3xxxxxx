,flemsus,2007-12-24T23:57Z,"I would have dropped the  french language, and added the space to the picture :-) Is the sound 5.1?"
,Emplehod,2007-12-26T01:45Z,"Yes, it is 5.1 Dolby Digital.

Removing the French soundtrack wouldn't have made a significant difference, according to the program.

I can upload the full DVD9 version if enough ask for it."
,tha_lode,2007-12-26T20:03Z,"Oooh. Full DVD 9 yes please!

,Emplehod,2007-12-28T02:30Z,"Yes, this is the new one.  I will get to work on the full DVD9, Disc 1."
,Emplehod,2007-12-28T03:22Z,"Well, I have the DVD9 but it won't let me upload it.  Is there some kind of limit?  I click the UPLOAD button and nothing happens."
,Emplehod,2007-12-28T03:45Z,"Oh! HaHa!  What an idiot.  I was trying to upload the original file, not the torrent.

Hey, I told you I was new at this.

The DVD9 torrent is named:

Blade_Runner_Final_Cut_DVD9_Region1_English_French_CloneDVD2.iso"
,hephnat,2007-12-31T03:19Z,flemsus: Philip K. Dick is HUGE in France and Blade Runner is one of the all-times cult movies there.
,Emplehod,2008-01-02T18:30Z,"So, are you saying that DICK is HUGE?  Can we talk like that here?  HaHa."
,tomca,2008-01-10T03:55Z,"Emplehod, could you please please please pleaseee upload a fixed version of the DVD9 of Blade Runner? Please!"
[V],velvetfog,2008-01-10T06:00Z,"Excellent version.

Thank you."
,SkywalkerAlf,2008-01-13T23:04Z,i like to know if has cometary track???
,MonsterCow,2008-01-15T05:29Z,Don't forget to read the book :)
,Emplehod,2008-01-18T01:51Z,"SkywalkerAlf:

If you mean like the director's commentary, it actually has 3 different tracks, all in English, as well as the movie soundtrack in English and French.

If you mean Harrison Ford's narration during the movie, then no, it doesn't.  That version was released in the theaters and was never released on DVD.  I think it may be included though in the new 5-disc version, as well as the first ""Director's Cut"" version.  Ridley Scott didn't like the narrative version.  He felt people should be able to figure out what was going on without having to be told by the narrative.  I agree.  I think the movie is better without it.

If people want me to upload anymore torrents, I might, but I've been catching a lot of heat here from some people and it's irritating.  A lot of you have also thanked me and I appreciate that.

I already have these two movies prepared:

""Starship Troopers 2"" (English 5.1 Dolby Digital & DTS, French Dolby surround, High Definition, anamorphic widescreen 1.78:1, file size: 6.59 Gb)

and

""The First Men In the Moon""

The classic 1964 movie remastered in high definition, anamorphic widescreen, discrete 4.0 surround (English) and subtitles in:

English
French
Spanish
Portuguese
Chinese
Korean
Thai

(Never seen a movie with so many subtitles).

This version looks incredible.  I have it in both the DVD9 version with all the extras (6.31 Gb) or just the movie itself (3.95 Gb)."
,tomca,2008-01-29T18:06Z,"Emplehod, please upload Blade Runner DVD9!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,BigFuze,2008-03-31T19:16Z,"hey, thanks for your efforts.  I too would love to see the DVD9 version of the NTSC final cut .  There is a pal version on this site now, but it includes audio tracks in Spanish, German, and Polish, and I suspect that the video bitrate is lower because of this.  It also has a shorter runtime (because of the pal speedup), so the NTSC version is much preferred."
,kevster1976,2008-06-15T00:38Z,"whatever man!!! NTSC or PAL, just aslong as the man Emplehod uploads it, i dont care what format its in. This timeless classic cornerstone of a movie  should be seen by everybody. and leave the subs in as it should be appreciated for all the global torrent comunity.

so whos on the commentary tracks?? Ridley???

I am on the look out for the all the DVDs in the speacial edition. 1982,1992 and the final cut, plus the extras disc. anybody know where i can get them from???
