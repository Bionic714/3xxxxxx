Overview:	Hui Ying-hung, legendary director Chang Cheh창??s discovery, and the protege of equally legendary director Liu Chia-liang co-stars with Liu창??s nephew, Liu Chia-yung in this fast-paced, action packed comedy of kung-fu characters. Liu Chia-yung is saved from drug smugglers by Hui Ying-hung, whose godfather is a 창??drunken master창?? and whose leprous godmother is mistress of the fairly off-putting Leprosy Boxing style. Action choreographers Huang Hsia and Chen Ti-ke also appear in this amusing, entertaining winner where flesh really gets into the fighting.
