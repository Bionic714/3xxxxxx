Would take too long to explain.

Can you get this codec for free?, or any chance of you going for something different?
Had to ask.

,mistertpitydafoo,2007-12-21T15:31Z,"divx offers a free divx ultra player that should clear up your problems. I can do it a different way. I used to just do xvid or divx but with the divx ultra format, I thought it was awesome how I can have menus if I want, can rip several different subtitles, can place several different audio tracks with the movie (some I have upped have both Cantonese and Mandarin audio). It makes it really easy for ripping dvds too. If a lot of people are having problems then I will gladly switch back to the old tried and true way. Only other reason I do it, is I had recently purchased a dvd player that can do divx ultra and from the ones I've watched I grew to like the features the new format has. But if enough people mention they don't like it, I will switch to please the majority.  I miss demonoid too!! I wish someone would start up a kung fu movie community somewhere!"
