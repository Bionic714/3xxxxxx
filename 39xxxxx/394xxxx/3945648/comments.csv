,madkat1125,2008-01-08T19:16Z,CORRUPT TORRENT DON'T DOWNLOAD IT!
,jroc74,2008-02-14T07:06Z,"Its not corrupt. Somehow it opens best in a Mac OS.... U can use the generic zip program that comes with XP to open this. It wont work using Winrar, havent tried Winzip."
,andrewtechhelp,2008-03-12T09:55Z,"I expanded this torrent with Stuffit Expander for Windows to extract the file and it didn't work. After checking the file size in Stuffit Expander it said that the ISO was compressed -831% and when I checked the extracted ISO it was only about 530MB.

So I have come to the conclusion that this torrent is corrupt and am now trying the iATKOs v1.0ir2 torrent instead. May work for you but beware that you may be downloading a 3.51GB file and find out that it was inflated."
