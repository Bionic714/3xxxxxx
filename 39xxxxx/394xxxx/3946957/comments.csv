,NorwegianDelight,2007-12-30T00:22Z,"So, how do you install it.. so many components, hard to see what is the ""real"" setup to start. 
Would appreciate some assistance here Ubehage. 
Norsk? Dansk? 

I s책 fall, svar p책 ditt morsm책l.
Thank you.
Tusen Takk."

There is autorun on the dvd. Open that, and choose ""Nero 8"", or ""Nero Burning ROM 8"".

The installer might take some time to load.. Have patience.
Then choose ""Custom Install"", and select/deselect the components you want installed.

That's it."

,spag2008,2008-01-06T11:13Z,Is this only Nero Burning Rom 8? Or the whole Nero Start Smart & it's components are included?

- Nero Burning ROM,
- Nero StartSmart,
- NeroVision,
- Nero Home,
- Nero Media Player,

,Locelo,2008-08-13T20:51Z,Seed please. Stuck at 56.6 %. :(
,Locelo,2008-08-14T10:59Z,"I downloaded, installed and register with installer, but in Nero Home, first time when I used Nero, Nero says something like this: Nero spotted you using pirated software key, what can I do?
Sorry for little bad english. I'm seeding best what I can."
,Locelo,2008-08-14T11:00Z,"And my Norman scanner spotted toolbar.exe, it's infected file."
,kebakent,2008-12-27T15:57Z,"Don't download this.
I got a message that it registered a pirated serial number. That probably means my IP got logged.
Find another torrent."
,Ubehage,2009-08-30T13:59Z,"LOL, don't register you moron :)"
,supersaiyan55,2010-02-11T22:26Z,then how we suppose to install this. when we need to put down the serial key. which it would detect it as a pirated software... 
,supersaiyan55,2010-02-12T00:39Z,i think you are in kahoots  with nero or however you spell the word. unless you tell us how to install this software without typing in the serial key number
,kabel89,2010-02-28T21:42Z,"Its really good torrent..............
