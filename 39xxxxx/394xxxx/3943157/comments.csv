Other then giving the community one more seed, downloading this if you have a G5 will accomplish nothing at all."

how to install ... and comments
"
,logicalnot,2007-12-22T18:48Z,"I own Macs and a PC, so I was happy to find this. I have retail copy of 10.5. Is there any way to install that on my P4"
,logicalnot,2007-12-22T18:51Z,"Yes you can apparently, I just popped in the disk and it started to load boot camp, cool."
,zarac,2007-12-22T21:25Z,"strangedogs, what is your problem?
jealous of people who run the same OS on the hardware they paid MUCH less than you?

this is REAL DEAL as well. it runs faster on my aging amd than on your g5 :D

and don't give me s### about legality 'cause i've seen your torrent (not quite legal)"
,zarac,2007-12-22T22:20Z,"well, my friend, there are other apps made for mac you can't run. 4 instance crossover, parallels, or fusion (intel only)

what now?
ban the mac section if you can't run it?"
,DEATHMOVE,2007-12-22T22:55Z,"@ strangedogs

yep, it's getting very confusing. this is clearly for the pc and yet it's in the mac section. i've seen this happen more often now. luckily apps like parallels and vmware fusion don't get posted to the pc section. maybe only mac users know what machine they bought."
,kerson,2007-12-23T01:42Z,"@strangedogs: It's is the Mac OS so it's posted under the Mac section, how fucking hard can it be to understand that, why should it be posted under the Windows section when it's clearly Mac stuff.
Stop trolling stupid."
,Core2All,2007-12-23T06:38Z,"No, bite my ass you pathetic PPC mac user.
Try to upgrade your machine, turdball.
Just fuck off from this site!"
,tazmania3,2007-12-23T08:32Z,what is the problem it should be under mac and it doesnt mater where insted off talking here on other things related to the torrent and all mac users stop that shit and be happy that  we all use mac os cos alot of users makes lots of cracks and help... i bought the first g5 when it was out
,vldjan,2007-12-23T08:44Z,"Doesn't work at all, just reboots the PC after it starts loading."
,birbir,2007-12-23T12:58Z,"vldjan, have u tried the support at uphucks forums?? im using it actually using it right now, and several others have it working great. so its nothing wrong with the torrent, its your setup or system... or its just intel inside but brainless outside ? :)"
,axept,2007-12-24T22:57Z,"doesn t work for me too..
i have leo flat image installed and running.
i think this version only works if you have a core duo! not working with a P4 531 .and some people with core duos need to tipe"" cpu=1"" to start at command prompt! kalyway bloated version as the same problem...Install ok but doesn t boot gave me some error about ACPI kext.something. missing or failed to load.waste..."
,plinxie,2007-12-26T14:19Z,Yep Actually Intel Core xx is needed to boot this.
,guitarist1,2007-12-27T15:07Z,"I installed this a number of times on a Dell e1405 notebook and found it HORRIBLY crash-prone. Also tried Kalyway with the same dismal result. After wasting two days I went back to Uphuck's 1.4i and things are unbelievably smooth, the machine runs very cool and no lockups. I say this to make you reconsider leaving what is a world-class Tiger install for the hype surrounding this and it's disappointment like I did. Give it a few months- you know what they say, ""A premature baby is an unhealthy baby."""

,Adamal,2008-02-28T06:54Z,"Should be noted: I tried to open this with WinRAR, and it reported 'Unexpected end of archine'. And wouldn't extract. 
I downloaded Winzip 11.1, and that unpacked it fine. 
Still love WinRAR, this just seems to be the exception. "
,rad2girls,2008-03-12T20:13Z,"this is relevant in both mac and windows section because it has to do with both mac and windows, have u guys ever thought of it like that?"
,divikgupta,2008-03-16T18:48Z,"Dont download this file.
Most of people including me are facing same problem.
The computer restarts itself after booting.
So time wasting file.
Thankyou."
