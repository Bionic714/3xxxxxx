,hammerogod,2008-01-14T09:52Z,"Richard Dawkins is both intensely right and intensely wrong.

If he would analyze the nature of mankind instead of trying to unsuccessfully analyze (and refute) the nature and existance of God he could point a light at some of the changable intellectual failings of religion.

Dawkins is a very bright man.
But..He cannot, has not, and will not disuade believers.

He could point his intellect at what has gone wrong both in the realm of science and the realm of religion and make a few valid, useful, positive, and needed observations.

As it stands all he has made is more disconcert between those who are truly looking for answers."
,Bastardo8,2008-01-16T14:00Z,hammerogod: What a nice way of saying that you just don't get it!
,Diceman_,2008-01-17T19:32Z,"Bad encoder settings, 56kbps 22khz stereo (almost as bad as the early Skeptic's Guide to the Universe podcasts). They could have halved the size or doubled the quality if they'd used mono!

I see it's in the summary, didn't notice it."
,Maoxx,2008-02-29T00:15Z,"No, the problem is simply that Dawkins is a pompous dick that's on a crusade to prove his own excellence to the world. Everything he says has been said before, and better. Don't waste your time on his self-righteous drivel. Check out Sam Harris for some much better formulated arguments against the whole ""God"" debacle, and Steven Pinker if you feel that his ideas about biology taste a bit too much like poo."
,Monomatapa,2008-03-16T13:48Z,"you don't only need to say things the right way, you have to do the marketing part as well in able to reach ppl.

If there is a God, Dawkins would be his name :p"
,nrosselot,2008-03-19T22:56Z,"Thanks, but quality is REALLY POOR... could not bear with it..."
,zubero,2008-04-30T07:29Z,"Dawkins is Awesome !
I was going thru a religious course...while I watched his Documentary.
And he cleared out many things.
Unless u are ready to think outside the box... u'll never understand him.
He wiped out 95% of my beliefs in religion.

REMEMBER, Think outside the box !!!"
,Komsip,2008-05-17T21:04Z,"I don't know if my hard drive or bit torrent client is at fault or the files that are uploaded are causing this. But this torrent does a lot of skipping and jumping and plopping and it really seems like there is something wrong with the files, like they are broken.  Did anyone else experience this?

This audiobook but from another torrent which I have lost by now was actually the first audio book I ever listened to in my life, and since I've started liking listening to audio books a lot. Thanks"
,nashmunsh,2008-06-24T15:33Z,the tracks skipped quite a few times but definitely interesting content
,lma65148,2008-07-26T22:52Z,Dawkins changed his mind after he met me.
,daoistic,2008-08-06T09:37Z,"Hammerogod, excellent point. Of course you cant dissuade believers, why try? These people flock to religion in order to fill holes in their lives. No amount of logic about science or religion will do for them what their beliefs do. "
,wilson1375,2008-08-17T07:54Z,"I personally don't think you can use ""logic"" and ""religion"" in the same sentence.  The whole basis of it is to accept something you can never prove. Trying to hammer down logic into a fundamentalist is like hitting on a lesbian feminist.  You can never prove God doesn't exist, nor can you prove he does.  Science is just as flawed as religion.  People have died defending their beliefs on both sides, so why compare the two?  Either way, I'm not interested in someone else's beliefs.  I now realize I'm basically repeating hammerogod (who made a very valid point imo), but I'm bored :) Cheers"
,krupasc,2008-10-12T09:57Z,"I also agree that hammerogod made a good point... though I haven't experienced much of Dick Dawk - aside from part 1 of a 5 part ""Growing up in the universe"" series of his... and some various youtube clips where he seems pretty arrogant in his delivery.  But what about the void?  The void motive force that carries the ego... when we refer to my ego... identify yourself ""my""!!!  I just want to suggest philosophers and authors like Alan Watts, Robert Anton Wilson, Manly P. Hall, Aleister Crowley, etc.  It seems to me that we utilize our language as best we understand it to represent our experiences... but this is practically impossible because we learned our language from others... so isn't that a fraud in some sense?  boggles the mind when I start thinking of paradoxes... hey, but I dig us all, ya know?  I find I can't really be upset too much at anyone anymore... even if I get caught up in a debate, and we're trying to persuade one another, prove this that, invalidate your argument based on this evidence that argument... hey... we're all at our own individual and collective stages of development, or evolution, spiritual expansion, ascension... call it what you want... but as soon as we label it, it's instantly misrepresented, as I understand the paradox of describing our experience.  word....

,edwat10,2008-10-18T20:54Z,"Everybody needs something to believe in. For the weak minded it?s a god or gods. 
Myself? I worship at the alter of the all powerful Vagina. Ultimately everything I do is for Vagina.
If you find yourself in the presence of a Vagina you should immediately get on your knees and rejoice! 

A true believer."
,fliteless,2008-10-20T03:55Z,edwat 10/At least your not afraid to be honest thats hopeful
,fish_fingers,2008-10-21T05:28Z,"The work Dawkins is doing is of vital importance. If we don't wake up out of the spell of religion, it will destroy us all.

that is all. please return to your warm and fuzzy place where sky daddy loves you."
,mariusc80,2008-11-22T09:14Z,"All I can say is that, worst thing, you can use some of the pointers in this book, to make the Jehova's witness ppl go away without an argument.

Also it's a good way of getting most religious attackers of atheism on the defensive."
,gavf,2008-11-25T18:57Z,"People who believe in any ""god"" are fucking retarded.

Thanks uploader."
,b1ketu58,2008-12-18T21:27Z,"great book, but does he seem to come off as just a bit intolerent...i mean i listened to attentively and understood most of it, but....i don't know...i don't believe in any theism, deism or whatever other deity they worship these days, i'm just trying to figure out if there's a way we can all get along, and not murder each other over scriptures that are known to be...not quite accurate, if at all..."
,b1ketu58,2008-12-18T21:36Z,"lol...""edwat10"" is a Vagina fundamentalist...oh what the hell, count me in."
,videostuff,2009-01-13T23:23Z,just wanted to say thanks. together with 'God is Not Great' it really changed my outlook. Now I am proud to be an atheist. Time to live life!
,Ratiocinator,2009-01-16T14:49Z,People are neglecting to ask what God actually is? Is it a field of energy or a dude with a big white beard?
,Bajafox,2009-01-19T18:41Z,Have not listened to it yet. Is the audio quality really bad?? Does it help to convert to 256 Kbps?
,Akiva,2009-01-22T17:55Z,"Most think of god as:

Gold
Oil
Drugs

Thank you very much!"
,aizomc27,2009-05-24T17:24Z,"Many thanks!! Very fast download, and a fantastic listen!! Have the book, but never have time to read it, but I can get through this piece by piece on the ipod on the way to work everyday!! Fantastic!"
,kristsj,2009-08-07T20:13Z,"Wow...

I will suggest this book to all the christians I know. 

Enough with delusions in this world! 

I don`t want people to live like that anymore. "
,metaliica,2010-02-22T23:07Z,"Im just hoping that someday we as humanbeings will grow up, and forget about our patetic primitive way of thinking about ANY religion.......

""religion was invented by our primitive ancestors long, long time ago, so that they could explain why the sun goes up every morning"".....


Ps. to ALL religious bongholes who think that they got the answer:  
Religion of anykind ain't for the modern times, never have, never will....so please i beg you, stop your bullshit believing and try to live a bit =) // over and out.... "
