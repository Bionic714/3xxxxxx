,madmax999,2007-12-26T19:04Z,I will post Walter Mitty this week.  I also have him in Hans Christian Anderson and A Song is Born (with Virginia Mayo).  Do you need those?
,elghosto,2007-12-30T09:13Z,"there is a good torrent on TPB for Hans Christian Anderson that I used last week. Don't think I ever saw A Song is Born, that would be nice."
