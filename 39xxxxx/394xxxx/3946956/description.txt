Wonderfully funny movie with Danny Kaye and other great character actors of the time. When growing up I would fake being sick to stay home and watch this.

Danny Kaye is the simpleton in a traveling snake oil show.  He is arrested as a vagrant in a town that is run on nepotism at its funniest, and then mistaken for the inspector general.  You will laugh all the way through.

Full screen, 720x480, appears to be VHS rip, the quality is ok. When I find DVD, I will upload.  English only, no subs.

I am also uploading The Court Jester.  Also excellent Danny Kaye.
