Normal justice just does not cut it anymore.

This is a film about being human, making mistakes and what kind of justice is sometimes needed to redeem those mistakes.

An intelligent dude takes justice into his own hands without seeking personal revenge.

This not an action movie, because it is a bit slow, but really worth watching.

Just the movie, no commercial b.s., no list of actors, no making of etc., if you want that, go buy the fucking DVD or wait until the movie is shown on TV.
