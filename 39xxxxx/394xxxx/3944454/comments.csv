,mikemn,2007-12-23T20:34Z,where do i find the updated cars and tracks is it a patch or a mod if you could upload that or post a link greatly appreciated nr2003 was the greatest 
,miker651,2007-12-24T01:04Z,"This installs as a new game. It's not a patch or mod to current installs of nr2003.

If you just want the cars and tracks for your current nr2003 I would say download this and copy all the tracks over to nr2003. Then copy over the 3 new series (COT, BGN, CTS) into the series for n2003.

The readme file has 12 links where all the new stuff was found. Sounds like a lot of work to find everything. I can post the links from the readme if you want it."
