,merlino211,2008-01-24T21:19Z,"People, just remember that organizations like the MPAA do employ bots/people to go around and call files fake or mistitles. 

This is one of the best copies of this movie out,

Audio: 10/10
Video: 8/10

Correct aspect ratio and looks great, even on a 60-inch DLP ripped to a DVD. 

If you have doubts about films use vcdquality.com ! Great website to help you pick the best rips out there and skip over dupes... or even bothering to read comments declaring real files fake."

,Sektion8,2008-03-16T20:51Z,"Those CAMERA idiots must love confusing a ton of people... How many people read CAMERA & move-on to another release. *I* know what to look for in the title, but most people don't."
