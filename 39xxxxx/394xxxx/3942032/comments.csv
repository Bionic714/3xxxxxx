,chirho,2007-12-25T03:53Z,i'm permanently seeding. so you should get it eventually. i'm on a 2.03 ratio ATM so someone else must have the remaining parts you need
,jb8888888,2007-12-27T18:35Z,Thanks very much for these. I've got the full set and all are excellent quality. Good man sir!
,Voo_Doo,2008-01-05T21:41Z,"I love the Boosh. It's just annoying that the series are first aired on BBC3.
I've got the channel, but thats in my lounge, and my rents wouldn't wanna watch this kind of program, so I'm stuck with the old terrestrial in my room at night"
,Jtodarizzo,2008-01-06T08:48Z,"Can anyone tell me how (im using Azureus) you select idividual files as i had been keeping up and only need sammy the crab, Cheers"
,rippitup,2008-01-09T08:36Z,"i too use azureus but the only way i know that you can select individual files is by using utorrent, it gives u the option automatically b4 it starts downloading. cheerz in advance 4 these chirho!"
,rippitup,2008-01-09T15:42Z,By the way there are a shit load more seeders and leechers than it says there are!
,Jtodarizzo,2008-01-10T09:04Z,"Cheers i might just source out this Utorrent thingy, and as far as i can tell from a description i read, is the christmas special not just the Live DVD?"
,chirho,2008-01-12T00:46Z,"There's no christmas special. BBC did show ""The Mighty Boosh Live at Christmas which was a dvd of the tour they made in 2006"
,jaloopa,2008-01-12T01:34Z,"in Azureus preferences click ""files"" on the left and then uncheck the top box which says Automatically download to default directory (no prompt). Then when you start a torrent it asks you where to download to, and which files to use.

Azureus does pretty much anything any other torrent program does, it just might take a while to find the option."
,eggontoastman,2008-01-14T00:00Z,"Every player I have used has a sync prob with these files 
ie. the picture is about 2 secs behind the sound!
Anyone else getting this?
Any one have a solution?"
,shivbean,2008-01-16T23:13Z,i downloaded the torrent but it didnt work for me.is there anyone who would send me the whole of season 3 that has got it?
,eggontoastman,2008-01-21T01:35Z,"re. my sync problems...
I have found VLC player and this plays the files fine. But no thanks to you techno-geeks out there. 
I would have really appreciated some help!
Oh well... Thanks for the great upload chirho!!"
,tinny112,2008-01-21T10:26Z,Everything works fine with VLC player. Gotta love the Boosh!
,Hunksoffunk2,2008-02-01T15:05Z,Thanks kid.
,FlyingD,2008-02-06T09:48Z,"Thanks for the torrent, but why the fuck MOV? QT is the biggest piece of shit."

,m39slowhand,2008-08-16T17:10Z,"I downloaded this, and everything appeared ok, but, try as I may I cannot get these bastard *.mov files to work, I tried them with VLC and KMPlayer and Irfanview and you name it, very dissapointed, have the bloody things and cant get them to play. Will try another.........."
,Momradn,2008-09-13T15:25Z,"Uh, I don't think the sound is synchronized... : /"
,patbayhighway,2008-09-18T04:43Z,this .mov format blows.  use avi next time douche bags
