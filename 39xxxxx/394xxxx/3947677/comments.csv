WTF kind of question is that? :D"

,Wolfe9165,2009-01-29T16:25Z,"Nice dude,

@Sondrejo
It's called a defect, open up a music editing program, highlight the inbetween silence, and select ""Cut"", save. There, fixed track.

@naznaznaz
This is an American band, there is no other languages. Don't like it? Learn how to sing in English.

Yes, I just am a bundle of fun."
,steveturner,2009-03-11T23:16Z,"@Wolfe9165

@LoVaKo
What's the music quality? Spic."
,orsoncart67,2009-08-18T03:53Z,"wolfe
its not a bleeping defect you silly person
theres ""something in the way"" polatics, religion, football, bullies and people with editing programs
(sic)     sorry for the rant but check before you post people, a lot of bands did this, silence thing.
peace  thanks for this, lost shit loads of disks in recent house move, again thanks"
,peanut607,2009-11-23T07:50Z,"Wake up buttholes, the silence is not ""between"" Something In the Way, the end is a bonus track."
[T],InternetNinjacy,2010-02-02T09:28Z,"I'm not quite as passionate as everyone else, but yeah I owned this album and lost it. Something in the Way DOES have a long silence and then another part on the original CD.

Thanks for the Up man, +."
,.tpb-dude.,2010-05-05T14:49Z,Thanks for the up !
,marut76,2010-12-17T22:52Z,"warning, audio on this has been altered !
some low noise is audible in background that sounds like someone tapping and scratching a plastic microphone
in fact, multiple of the 192 kbit - 81,5 mb rips of this album seem to be from the one and same source with the tainted audio, the noise is most heard in beginning of track #12 (low volume song)
suggest to pick other versions"
,marut76,2010-12-17T23:32Z,"Sorry, after more checking i have to say i may have been wrong.
As this noise only is audible when I'm listening with Winamp (my current verion is 5.601 Pro) and it could be some weird decoding bug.
Tho it is very hard to me to accept this conclusion, as Winamp is my main mp3 software that i have been using years almost every day and i have NEVER heard anything like this before.
The noise i hear with winamp is very distinct and just like a sound made with active microphone being fiddled with, seems like a loop of same recording.
No mic on my machine here.
Anyway, ignore my posts and decide for yourself."
,marut76,2010-12-17T23:49Z,"Forgot one more thing:
the noise is hearable when audio is set to MONO in Winamp options>playback !"
,bartlupez,2011-11-09T22:30Z,please seed!
