,FLICK_THE_MAGS,2007-12-24T02:56Z,"Good job putting the keyword ""karaoke"" in - this is what I search for - far easier - Thanks and Happy Christmas"
,EzeRoss,2007-12-24T12:19Z,"As a demonoider I always put Karaoke and cdg in the title as it was this that brought everyone together on the same page. A good habit to get into. It is great that some of you have got space to upload big files, unlike me. That is why I have deliberately avoided putting up stuff like Legends DKG, SGB, Sound Choice JVC, Music Maestro, Monster Hits, EK, EZA, EZC, EZH, Zoom, CBE, and of course Sunfly. If any one is looking for anything in particular or if you want to run through a series in smaller chunks, just let me know and I will see what I can do. Try to stick the karaoke word in your uploads and we will all meet here "
