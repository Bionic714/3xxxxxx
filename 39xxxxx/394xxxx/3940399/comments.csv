,Emarkay,2008-07-28T19:08Z,Thanks! Great quality!
,kingadrock,2008-10-17T08:26Z,"I feel obligated to point out that Richard Cheese is not on a major label, he self-produces his albums out of pocket, and his songs are covers so he has to pay tons of royalties... in short he doesn't make a lot of money. If you download his albums, do consider at least hitting his website and buying some merch."
,Ezekyle,2008-11-05T23:45Z,"Thanks for the upload! Just recently discovered the guy, and his albums aren't readily available here. "
