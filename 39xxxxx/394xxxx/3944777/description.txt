(digimob) Poke Runyon - The Rites of Magick (DivX)

The Rites of Magick is a feature length (90 minute) dramatic documentary on the rites, ceremonies and meditative practices of America's oldest continually operating Magical tradition: The Order of the Temple of Astarte in Southern California. The O.T.A. is the religious-fraternal order of The Church of the Hermetic Sciences incorporated in 1971. This production was filmed and video-recorded in temples, outdoor henges, and retreats of the Order from 1974 to the 21st century. It is divided into six chapters: Hermetic Yoga, Pathworkings, Seasonal Ceremonies, The Magical Eucharist, Enochian Watchtowers, and -- as a special bonus feature -- a surrealist Alchemical Fantasy from the talented avant-garde filmmaker Eric Bossick.
