,topcat787,2007-12-24T23:04Z,This was my favorite game when it 1st came out. Played it over and over again with a microsoft gamepad.. Knew every in and out of each map. I included the compatibility Administrator in the torrent. I tested it on xp home sp2 and it works perfectly. I used Daemon tools pro to install/mount the image. Enjoy.
