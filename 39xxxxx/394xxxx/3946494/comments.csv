Over the years there have been a handful of ""Very Best of Deep Purple"" compilations. The uploader's description here on PirateBay describes the 2000 Rhino label release, however the actual contents of the torrent is the 2001 WEA International label release.

The actual torrent contents are tracks from ""Deepest Purple - The Very Best of Deep Purple"" (WEA International, 2001)...
