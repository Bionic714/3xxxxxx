,mr.liljedahl,2008-01-02T23:53Z,If this works youre my GOD =P
[T],ADHDerby,2008-01-03T10:00Z,"@ dbuster: It's not better, it's the same iso. ;)

@ mr.liljedahl: No worries,.. it works, I've tested it on several systems and OEM cards.
Works perfect on clean installs, if you don't have a clean install it's recommended to run Driver Sweeper and/or Driver Cleaner to remove driver and application leftovers from your system.

The only things that show up when you run Creative Software AutoUpdate afterwards are Creative MediaSource Player/Organizer 3.30.21, the MiniDisc Plugin 1.00.58 and the CD Burner Plugin 3.10.18, these are older versions!!"
,--DANNY--,2008-04-12T01:26Z,"Doesn't work with the HP OEM version of the X-Fi XtremeMusic. Model SB0670.
Only drivers that have worked for it (even tried ISO's patched with updated support.cab files to add OEM card support) are the offical drivers from Creative's website, but those don't include the software for equalizer, sound modes, 3D settings, etc.
