,ioniancat21,2007-12-22T17:22Z,"HOW TO INSTALL NERO 8 AND GET PAST PATENT ACTIVATION


FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO:
 - REGISTER NERO
 - STOP THE PATENT ACTIVATION/PIRATED KEY ERROR MESSAGES WITHOUT PROBLEMS

NOTE: Uninstall currently installed Nero applications before beginning this process.

1. Download and Install Nero Trial or Update v8.2.8.0. During setup Enter name and leave Demo license key in place. Do not replace demo key with full license key. Do Not Reboot after setup completes.

2. Remove all Nero startup files from these locations in the registry:
 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
 - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

3. Reboot Now

4. Run one of the Nero Applications that set off the Patent Activation screens, some of these applications are:

 - Nero Vision
 - Nero Showtime

Using Showtime proves easiest; Run Showtime and open a DVD as using the DVD Plugin sets off a license check. During this process you should be prompted with a Patent Activation window requesting you to go online to verify your license. Say ""Yes"" and go online, in a moment you'll get a response that Patent Activation is acknowledging your trial license and is giving you 15 Days to check out Nero, Click ""OK"" and play a couple of seconds of the movie to verify the trial license key is working then quit Showtime.

5. Open Nero ControlCenter. On the Update Tab uncheck the ""Check for Updates"" option turning this feature off. Now click the License Tab then click ""Add"" to enter a new license key. Run the Activator KEYGEN (Keygen_mtct.exe) and click the ""Generate"" button and create a new full license key. Copy and Paste the new license key into Nero ControlCenter. You should notice the new license added to your list of licenses with an expiration date of ""None"". Do not remove the trial license key, you should have two licenses, one full and one trial. Click OK to close Nero ControlCenter.

6. Make sure all Nero Applications are closed and not in use. Now go back to the KEYGEN and click ""Activate"", the KEYGEN will display an ""Activation successful"" message. Click OK and reboot.

7. Go to Nero ControlCenter and click the License Tab then click the mouse to highlight the Trial License key. Click ""Remove"" to delete the Trial key. You should now only have the full license key remaining in Nero ControlCenter. Click OK to close.

8. Complete Step 4 again and verify Showtime is still working, if it is you are permanently activated."

Try writing regedit in Run and click ok...  :-)"
,2799,2007-12-23T15:10Z,"Works great, no probs!

Thanks mate!"
,demonic666420,2007-12-24T00:35Z,I too am stuck on step 2 i know how to get to the reg editor but i am not too sure as to exactly what are nero files and what are not i was only able to locate 1 file. but my antivirys gives me the option to either allow or block the reg edit nero makes when it installs so can't i just block the reg entries and then go form there?
,glockmodel20,2007-12-25T05:22Z,i still get the notice from nero that they detected a pirated version
,netrueronin,2007-12-25T06:04Z,"Guys,... is this the file:
Version8.2.8.0
Release Date2007-12-19
File Size183 MB (192.369.280 bytes)
MD5 checksumf07e4f200e8b0dbd1e5a91f6b3805b00

From the website?  Where can I get this update, if this is not it?  Anyone?"
,RedDelPaPa,2007-12-25T08:56Z,So you rodeo clowns think this works huh?  You're in for a surprise.
,Yharr,2007-12-25T13:51Z,"Omg... 
This file is 406KB and u can't manage to seed that?? Stuck at 86 %"
,ioniancat21,2007-12-25T19:51Z,"Those of you who still receive a pirate version pop up must first use the Nero Clean Tool which you can download from Nero.com free. First run the cleaning tool then install using the steps above. 

For those stuck on step two open your command window or run and type regedit. Now find the key by opening the menus. CCleaner can also do this step as well in the Startup section. Delete all Nero references to startup files."
,mal47,2007-12-29T01:48Z,Thanks I work very well..Do you know if you can update
,mnstrfrmhell,2007-12-29T03:07Z,@ioniancat21 im stuck on step 2 i can get into regediter and i see nero but its not in the place u specify but im sure its the same but i dont know what im suposed to delete i dont see a run folder? email me at mnstrfrmhell@hotmail.com and thanks for your assistance

,TimppaKoo,2007-12-31T13:57Z,"From Embrace Nfo: 
2) Use our keymaker to register 
3) Remove 'NeroPatentActivation.exe' in folder 
X:\program files\common files\Nero\Shared\NL3 
(X=C,D or wherever your Windows is installed)
This step 3) will solve issues related to nero 
detecting pirated serials on PCs with bad or no firewall... 
- and i recommend it anyways, no-one will get hurt ;)) 
BTW: Happy New Year 2008 soon everywhere!!"
,TimppaKoo,2007-12-31T14:14Z,"And... 

Do NOT click ""Activate"" - It's just a 'Rootkit 
Bonus' serving the keygen maker - LoL! 
Use 'Nero ControlCenter' to input any key - always ;)) 

And ... Peace to the world - piece by piece! "

,spartan777,2008-01-21T01:04Z,"thanks phudi! everyone, follow phudi's instructions! no risking trojans, no illegal downloading, everything works perfectly!"
,markisthejob,2008-02-05T01:36Z,Hey good work phudi.I was just about to give up.his method seriously works.
,Shakerol,2008-02-08T16:18Z,"Hey, thanks Phudi :)

Här är en svensk version av Phudi69:s info.

1) Skippa all annan info.
2) Efter timmar av arbete med en key så har jag fått det att fungera.
3) Installera Nero som vanligt med antingen ""demo"" i serialfältet eller den här; 7K22-OO1B-11OS-E1SS-S9M4-B4X3-7E11
4) Gå till Start, Alla program, Nero 8, Toolkit och i där så ska du trycka på Control Center.
5) Nu så kommer du att se en lista (till vänster) med applikationer som är installerade. Längst ned så ska du avmarkera ""Kolla efter uppdateringar varje dag.""
6) På den vänstra sidan med applikationer så ska du klicka på Nyckel-ikonen. Tryck på lägg till knappen (längst ned till höger) och skriv in följande serials: (kom ihåg att när du har skrivit in serialen så klicka på ok och tryck på lägg till igen, gör så med alla serials)
 Blu-ray/HD DVD Video Plug-in:- EC06-206A-99K5-2527-940M-3227-K7XK
mp3PRO Plug-in:- 9C00-E0A2-98K1-294K-06XC-MX2C-X988
Lame MP3 Encoder:- 4C04-5032-9953-2A16-09E3-KC8M-5C80
LLS Plugin:- EC05-E087-9964-2703-05E2-88XA-51EE
HDDVD_TEST:- 5C0X-205M-99M1-2435-2118-K246-1576
NERO_TEST:- 4C0E-4009-9863-2X6M-1939-12A1-99A0
BD_TEST:- 5C0M-6027-1869-2C4K-4001-81E0-K6CA
7) Och glöm inte att ta bort ""NeroPatentActivation"" i C:\Program Files\Common Files\Nero\Shared\NL3.
Den kan också ligga i C:\Program\Delade filer\Nero\Shared\NL3. Eller blocka internet-tillgången för Nero 8."
