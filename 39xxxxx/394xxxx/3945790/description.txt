This packages contains everything you need to get working with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"shorten\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and other lossless compressed audio files.

I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m not the author of any of the programs or text, I merely put it all together in one file.

Also I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve put some helpful screenshoots from various websites. All the files have been downloaded from these websites.
Shorten files (.shn), are audio files that are compressed, so they can be stored or transfered over the internet. Shorten files are often used by musik-traders because of the significant smaller size and the ability to check the files integrity. Some media players can play .shn files directely with a special plugin.
The compression is 100% lossless, the output is absolutely identical to the input. 
You can even make a MD5 Hash fingerprint, so you can see, if the file is either corrupt or has been tampered with. Shorten has naitive support for wav files. If you want to use other lossless format, you may need to install extra addon modules. See shorten.pdf for more info.

Uharc is another high compression packer made for multimedia files by Uwe Herklotz. It is also a command-line utility, but I have included three different GUI in the zip file. Uharc proberly offers the best compression of audiofiles of all packers, but it is not particuliar quick if you are in a hurry. Uharc is great for full CDs.

With these great tools for lossless compression, there are no fucking lame excuses for fooling around with lousy mp3s.
