A collection of 60 ensembles for SynC Modular.

I've had these for my personal use since the (now dormant) Yahoo! group had a wonderful user community that also bore other, personal sites for SM. As such, I renamed the files to match the title of the ensemble and *may* have altered the grid layout of some of them slightly, though I don't recall if I did or not with any certainty. *Nothing* has been altered structurally.

This is still one of the best software synthesizers ever made and it's a shame that it didn't get more mainstream attention when it was still in active development. Hopefully, Dr. SynC is being well-funded at Native Instruments.
