An all time favorite radio show!"
,buddykins2006,2008-02-21T05:49Z,Massive thanks for this.  I have literally been searching for 7 years for all these shows!  Incredible!
,gettovista,2008-03-02T16:45Z,"This Is One Massive Torrent!! I Can Confirm This Both As A Quality Download Worth The D.L. The Sound Quality Is Ok Too.If This Person Has ANY Other HOS Programming,I Would Ask Them To Please Seed Other Shows.I Will Re-Seed As Best As I Can......Peace Out....gettovista.
Also Noted In This Torrent Is A Useable reference To All The Shows Playlist And Direct Links Covering ALL The Shows Artist...."
,NYAdGuy,2008-03-26T05:39Z,"Be patient....you will be on this one for days on end.  However, the good news is that it's worth it!
All the HOS shows and all the show notes that can help you buy the full cds that Stephen Hill has sampled for you over 13 years of programs are in one package.  Including links to the albums!
This is quite simply, the essential home guide to New Age space music in a single file from the dean of the field.  It's a great place to start if you are new; and a great place to fill in the blanks if you have been around the galaxy.
Compiling a list like this yourself would be out of the question.  So take the time to thank Jey6941, and to download this labor of love.  Soon you will be drifting into the hearts of space...
Safe journey space fans...where ever you are..."

,jey6941,2008-10-16T23:19Z,"Hey all!

I'm glad that you are enjoying this torrent!  I have to admit, I was not sure if there would be enough people out there to support the broad-based seeding of this torrent.  Please continue to seed this torrent as long as possible.

Please make sure that you sign-up for at least one month of membership at the Hearts Of Space website (HOS.com) to support Steven Hill and all of his great work.  It is my hope that by including the play lists in the torrent that all of you will support the artists who contributed such great works to the HOS universe.  There are phenomenal artists out there such as ""Dead Can Dance"", Brian Eno, Robert Rich, Steven Roach, and Vangelis to name a few.  Please buy their CD's!  

I apologize for the quality of the sound, but I started this project about six years ago, a time when broadband was still reaching maturity.  Hence, the occasional drop-outs in the program.  I tried as hard as possible to edit the blank spots, but it was a manual process and I am sure that I missed some drop-outs.  It took me about two years to compile the entire work, but it was definitely worth it!

I have the entire catalog on my iPod and it is great to sit-back and float throughout the Universe with such a great collection from Steven Hill.

Thank you for all of your positive feedback!  Enjoy."
,kismit,2008-11-01T06:17Z,"Holy Moses!  Thank you a million times, and please keep seeding.  I am a HOS fanatic and this is heaven."
,theloner81,2008-11-10T21:48Z,"Good upload, only problem is the quality of most of the tracks. Lots of distortion and scratching, if you decide to dowload this, make shure you know how to restore audio. If at all possible, for the people that don't know how to do this, please re-do this torrent in a higher quality. Good effort though."

,spen007,2011-06-12T15:57Z,"I have no idea who you are and honestly really don´t care, but what you deserve is a blessing from the Gods and a great bottle of wine! Thanks buddy!"
,spen007,2011-06-28T22:22Z,"Hey Jey,

I´ve been downloading this torrent for more than a week on a 1mb internet connection. Now at 86% complete. Again thanks to you and the few other seeders making this download possible.
Other business: Years ago, I downloaded many, many HOS programs (Napster) and most I remember are of excellent quality. If some one can tell me where I can upload these for sharing I´d be happy to do so.
Regards,
Spencer in Brazil"
,spen007,2011-06-30T14:39Z,Mission completed. Downloaded! Thank you all!
,Frigeri,2011-09-07T18:51Z,"Hey Spencer, why don't upload your HOS programs here in TPB? It would be awesome.

Also, thanks for the uploader, this is one of the best torrents ever!"
,Frigeri,2011-09-09T17:32Z,"Thank you! The download just finished.

I will not seed this torrent because my 1mb connection doesn't let me do much, but I have plans of downloading the latest shows and putting them together in a updated torrent here for everyone when I have a better internet connection. I hope this will be soon!

Thank you again!"
