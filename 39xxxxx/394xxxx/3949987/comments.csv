What theempty1 said is true. It seems not a lot of guys (or women) like soft core fashion show stuff. But I really enjoyed it. I dont know but the hardcore or ""to the point"" nudity isnt that good anymore. I'm bored with fake oohs and ahhs.

Anyone knows another fashion show, behind the stage, or bloopers? It's hard googling around those stuff.."
