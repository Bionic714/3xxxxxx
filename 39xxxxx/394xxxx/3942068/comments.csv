We had taped it from PBS when I was a kid but the tapes were old and getting really flakey (and like you find a good VCR anymore) and I've been searching for this show on every site I can think of for the last four years with no luck until now (and the DVDs were all Region 2 of course). 

I'm SO grateful, this was one of the funniest shows ever around and it will be fun to see it again after six years of not watching it. 

I'll seed forever (I'm disabled and home most of the time so I'm able to seed almost all day)."
