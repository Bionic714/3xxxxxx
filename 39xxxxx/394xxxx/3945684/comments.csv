,rarowetzel,2007-12-23T23:41Z,Which version is it?
,rob010,2007-12-23T23:44Z,"This is not 14j which now is bigger in size.

This is not currently freeware and cannot be had freely.

This going off the size is either 3.0r14h or earlier"
,pellypels,2007-12-24T00:16Z,"You could also have the common courtesy and let the PPC users know that this is an Intel app!

Still - not a big DL anyway..."
,rob010,2007-12-24T00:27Z,"All versions of MTR from 3.0r14h have been UB versions and work on both PPC?INtel Macs prior versions are seperate.

Also from version r14i it requires a licence file to work."

,117olddude,2007-12-24T15:54Z,"For all you Pirates out there, this is not the newest version and will not rip the newest movies.  May I suggest you go to ripdidfferent.com, join the forum, send a small monetary gift to the developer, get the newest version (and the license that makes it work), and join the club.  There are some apps that just call out for support, and this is one of them.  Do yourselves a favor and support it.  Think of it as an Xmas gift to the developer and to yourself."
,rarowetzel,2007-12-24T22:39Z,It's version 3.0 r14d
,rarowetzel,2007-12-24T22:45Z,"Sorry, it's not version 3.0 r14d but 3.0 (YOSHI) build 14 (not working on Leopard)!"
,avincent,2007-12-26T21:02Z,Actually I have that version and it does work in 10.5.1.
,masterbluestar,2007-12-27T03:17Z,"Seems to work in Leopard (10.5.1) but only in ""Full Feature Extraction"" mode so far. Crashed on ""Main Feature"" extraction mode."
,darkbros,2007-12-30T04:45Z,"then sir, you will have a VERY long wait indeed.
Support the developer, and then you will have a VOICE in the direction of the GUI."
,radradrobotank,2008-01-11T15:53Z,"Try a free app called Fairmount as an alternative to Mac the Ripper. It decrypts any DVD, then mounts an image free of all copy protection. You can then copy the VIDEO_TS to your hard drive. It works a lot better than MTR 2.6 does at this point. I don't know about MTR 3, but I've read some pretty sketchy stuff, and it's not easy to find."
,Nuggler,2008-01-17T05:21Z,117olddude. this rips everything i have ever tried. (PCB3) which is verr new
,CrankyBird,2008-05-27T04:08Z,"How is this different from the file below?
Some more info would help.

DVD-ripper v4.0.53.1116 (intel mac)+serial
