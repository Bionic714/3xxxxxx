,vrolok_1,2008-08-01T09:59Z,"what is wrong with this torrent?  the .rar files hang up on unpacking.  eventually you get DVD files and then only about the 1st 1/2 of the dvd works, but the last half is missing.

I've dl'd x2, and done several Force Checks."
,vrolok_1,2008-08-02T05:35Z,"iRS:  Your DVD's are having some serious problems.  I've downloaded each of the Absolute Metal DVD's you created.

Each DVD you created has a different issue and 1 of them isn't even complete.

PB users:  don't download this crap.  iRS took normal cable videos and cut about 1-2"" off the top of each one.  then he burned each video to a DVD and output as .ISO

The DVD formats are full of errors and the video quality isn't that good.  27 videos for 4.23 gigs?  I wish somebody else had posted what crap these 4 torrents were before I wasted 2 days and ~15 gigs of HD space downloading.

I won't be seeding this drivel.  It doesn't deserve to be spread.  Maybe a repack of the 4 dvd's without errors would be worth distributing"
