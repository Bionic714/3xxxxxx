,stuntpilot,2009-09-30T22:27Z,"Kriya is a powerful breating technique recommended by your friendly guru Shri Shri Ravi Shankar, who founded Art of Living, the worlds largest spiritual organisation.

The technique may cause an alterede state. Some laugh, some cry. Use only when you are safe and have time to enjoy.

Description: follow directions on tape by breathing heavily in 3 phases. Each phase has 3 speeds of breathing. The breaths are shorter and shorter. In-breath is Sooo, out-breath is Huumm. Repeat the words mentally as you breath.

In yoga, breathing techniques are called kriyas. Other terms: Hyperventilating, rebirthing, regression, holotropic breathing, breathwork.

Be blessed and safe!"
