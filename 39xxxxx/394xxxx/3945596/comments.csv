,CDN_Ranger,2007-12-29T12:59Z,"I do appreciate anyone who puts up good DVD rips, but I do have one complaint. I wish you guys would stick to DivX, instead of XviD. I, and many like me, own DivX compatible DVD players for our home entertainment systems, and XviD just doesnt seem to work nearly as reliably, often hangs up the DVD player altogether, and I end up having to unolug it just to get the disc out.

PLZ use DivX !!!!!"

You got that right! 

This isn't your 'average' western. Of course, its set in the time of the old west but its not like any Clint Eastwood movie (Check those out, they are great too). The movie isn't focused on guns or shooting but more on the troubles of a family. But if you do like movies with that 'badass' outlaw, then of course Ben Foster did a great job as Charlie Prince. Out of ALL the movies on Piratebay, I recomend this one! Its my favorite. Enjoy! Also, This film has excellent quality of course as it is a DvDrip. "

Oh well, burn the midnight oil... The FXG's Simpsons movie played fine on my player though, so I don't know what went wrong.

For those who can't play it on computer use GSpot codec appliance to see which codecs you need. Or download Klite codec pack. (Google to find download sites for these).

Worked fine for me."
