You can view rmvb movies using Windows Media Player Classic. If you're using Windows XP, go to ""Start"". then click ""Run"". Where it says ""Open"" type in ""mplayer2"", and the Media Player Classic program should pop up. Then go to ""File"" then ""Open"" and hit ""Browse"" tofind the directory where the file you want to play is located. When you find it, press ""Open.""

Looking at the torrent details, I can see why the subtitle won't work. Give the ""sub"" file the exact name of the movie file. after you download it, change the ""vob_sub.sub"" file to ""Warlords.sub"" and it should all work. "
