This is a Danish film version of \\\"The White Horse Inn\\\", filmed on

location in Austria. It is presented here as a musical, rather than

as an operetta, which makes it suitable for a wider audience. Dirch

Passer (as Leopold) is at his best here, and the other actors are

well fitted to their roles, especially Ove SprogÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â¸e as Leopold\\\'s rival,

Sigismund. There is none of the vulgarity that can be found in

some of Passer\\\'s later films, only light-hearted humour and

romance. Oh, and the landscape is breathtaking. 




En klassisk film med alle de gode gamle danske stjerner i fuld dvd kvalitet.
