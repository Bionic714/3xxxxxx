,themoj0,2007-12-27T14:35Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS!~!~!~!~

Its the 'directors commentary' version of his act.  You can see his act going on in the background, but you cant hear it because all you hear is him and the director talking about how he got started in comedy and blah blah blah.  Dont waste your time.  once again...the Pirate Bay falls short compared to demonoid."
,Chevy55,2007-12-28T03:56Z,"The above poster doesn't  realize there are two audio tracks with the 2nd including the directors commentary as an added bonus. What a jerk!!

BTW fool, I am from Demonoid and uploaded two to three movies a week for two years. Demonoid has shut down. "
,themoj0,2008-01-01T18:56Z,"interesting..as i couldnt get the other track to work yet.

also..i didnt say demonoid WASNT shut down..cockbyte.  ive been using it for years..i am well aware of its current demise..but i do appreciate your concern.  kisses."
,themoj0,2008-01-02T04:12Z,"oh yeah..and exactly what do you use to find the real audio track?  since every time you run it in a media player..all it does is run the stupid commentary.  In my ten years in this 'scene', ive never come across something so gay as this.  it wouldnt even let me burn it to a dvd.  pleae..God, help Demonoid come back online, so i can be rid of this gheyness."
,ernie77,2008-01-05T22:01Z,"Obviously ""10 years in this scene"" wasn't enough for themoj0 to understand that a avi file can contain several audio tracks.  
There is nothing wrong with these files.
Audio track 1 is normal audio and audio track 2 is a commentary track.
Just use a better media player, like VLC."
,corganite,2008-01-09T19:26Z,"Look I´m as new as a newbie can be but hey.. What´s the deal? 10 Years in the scene? I got both audio tracks to work fine. And I haven´t even entered ""the scene"" yet..

Just as ernie77 said:
Run it in a good media player like vlc. This is a great torrent. Don´t hesitate to download. Good seed."
,skwiley,2008-01-25T19:28Z,"Guessing 10 years on the ""scene"" hasn't been enough time for ""themoj0"" to figure out how to download ConvertXtoDVD and burn AVI files to a DVD...  maybe another ten'll let him figure out what most of us learn in a week...  retard... Excellent UL, thank you very much Chevy55!"
,karljohan92,2008-01-26T21:56Z,"Ur an f... asshole themoj1! Are u stupid or something? 10 years in the scene, in my ass!"
,mouzou,2008-01-26T23:01Z,"F*****G nerd!! Im talking about you themoj0..
Be happy that there are sites like Pirate bay or demonoid or whatever at all!
stop giving us your views or sitegradings, and save em for your buddies at the computer club for beginners"
,deaconmeth,2008-01-27T08:21Z,"10 years on the scene but not uploaded a single torrent yet...neither have I, but I don't claim any ""street cred"" .ehehh"
,StebbeMannen,2008-01-31T01:38Z,"Works great!!! This guy is outstanding.

THX to UL"
,StebbeMannen,2008-01-31T01:46Z,"I'm truly amazed by ""themoj0"". Jeffs puppet Bubba J has more brain than him even when Jeff's not controling him. I've run both files in WMC, Media Player 10 vista 64, winamp, and Nero Showtime. All works great. So themoj0's ten years in the scen says more of his skill of learning than anything els. "
,mondeo98,2008-02-08T20:16Z,themoj0... I have 4 letters for you... STFU !
,PsycoMonkey,2008-02-15T20:20Z,"the ""unbleeped"" version seems to be a different section, only a bit of the act (or a different one).
I watched the ""bleeped"" version and nothing was cut or edited so.....

Anyhow, great upload, thank you greatly"
,biggidude,2008-03-10T19:54Z,hahahaha themoj :'D im 12 and i use vlc and im from iceland and this is something a monkey can do bwahahahaha
,BreezyFoSheezy,2008-03-12T03:26Z,"Okay, I don't want to get into an argument like the asshole above, but it took me 2 days to download it, the unbleeped part works fine, but it's only like 3 minutes long, the other audio file is the directors commentary. Is there like something else supposed to be there, or did I was 2 frickin days downloading what I thought would be the full length dvd on one file, and then the directors commentary on the other... WHAT THE HECK?!"
,bjarte92,2008-05-07T15:52Z,"Jeff Dunham is great, no doubt about it, but I'm getting tired of people who use this kind of comment system for arguing and irrelevant comments. Constructivity is what we need!

(and socialism)"
,vidarmoen@hotmail.com,2008-06-05T16:15Z,"THIS IS BULLSHIT IT'S THE 'directors commentary' AS themoj0 IS SAYING 

DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
,TobiasTheReaper,2008-06-15T17:45Z,"I think there's a bad case of stupidity going around.
USE A BETTER MEDIA PLAYER
This torrent works just fine. VLC should become your default media player because it uses pretty much every video codec you can think of and it's extremely functional. There are two audio tracks (which you can find under the audio heading in VLC)."
,morit7,2008-07-07T19:43Z,hahaha noob themojo windows media player sucks.. real deal is VLC ;b haha
,janstebner,2008-10-25T10:13Z,have you sub to this
