Playing straight man to partners half his size, ventriloquist Jeff Dunham -- one of America's funniest comics -- slays audiences throughout the United States. In this hilarious video, Dunham is in his element, giving voice to such characters as elderly crosspatch Walter, wisecracker Peanut, pepper-on-a-stick Jose Jalapeno, Bubba J and Sweet Daddy Dee. There's no argument: This performance will have you rolling with laughter.
