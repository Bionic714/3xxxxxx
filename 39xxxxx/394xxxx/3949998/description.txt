Plot:	"The Flag Of Iron" is good clan versus bad clan in a movie so filled with "don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-something" gags, you will need to watch it over and over again so you can see the things you missed.

Overview:	The master of the respectable and honored Iron Flag Clan is murdered by the mysterious Spearman, an assassin hired by the elder brother of the clan Chow Feng. He takes over the Iron Flag and uses it for immoral purposes. However, in order to cement his position, Chow must kill the virtuous brother Lo; so he hires the nefarious Ten Killers of the Underworld, who team up with The Spearman in order to defeat these masters of death and exact suitable revenge. What unfolds is a well-paced and vibrant battle of wits and weaponry between Chow and the Lo/Spearman, all of which is kept under Chang Cheh's traditionally meticulous control.
