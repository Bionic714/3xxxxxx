:: Notes on Lossy Releases:

My lossy releases use one of my personal favorite codecs (the latest tested build of either LAME-APS or NDAAC) and are made with the same attention to quality as my lossless (FLAC) releases. I make these releases for those who want a quick download and are not in need of the bit-for-bit archival benefits of a lossless release, but still desire for transparent quality in their lossy music library. These are "special" releases that are a departure from my normal (lossless) NEORIP release scheme, and are typically made for rarer albums that have a lack of existing releases. They are provided as an "extra service," if you will. Enjoy. :)

:: Other Notes:
There will be a lossless (FLAC) release of this album at a later time. If you are looking for a bit-for-bit identical (burnable) archive of the original, wait for that release.
