Client for the current Warhammer: Age of Reckoning Beta (European Client), for people who are interested in looking at the files/datamining. 

You can't play the game without an WAR Beta account. I don't have one and even if i'd had, i couldn't provide it, since they are very strict on banning the accounts.
