,yesiamb,2008-11-05T00:42Z,How hard is it to download a video converter? Bitch some more.
,Johnnystarship,2008-11-25T18:56Z,Same here. I'm going to download another version. Maybe divx next time or something. Damn.
,isaaccerda,2009-01-26T23:36Z,"download my alive video converter it's free, it's even got for ipod or for anything else. it doesn't look as much but it really works 100%"
,moomoo121,2009-04-15T05:49Z,hahaha. lame cunts. that's what you get for being a nub. use vlc player. mkv is superior!
,t3man,2009-06-26T12:44Z,"Since it's in .mkv you can either open it VLC player or use download the Combined Community Codec pack and be able to load it through Windows media player or WMP classic (included in the pack).

,CrownVic96,2009-08-08T23:58Z,"STFU you douches. It's free, it's avail, and mkv is great, if ya don't like it you should quit yer bitching and move along. 

TY marckos"
,Jack_Sin,2010-03-08T13:54Z,"VLC, Windows Media Player, EMP Classic, etc. Most players can now play most MKV files as long as you have the right codec(s) installed.

Though Mplayer (For Linux or Windows) is the best video player in my opinion."
,Jack_Raiden,2011-06-25T02:47Z,"People shouldn't mind MKV's: It's foolish. In this case, the MKV container was not taken advantage of (subtitles/chapters/etc), so an MP4 container will also work. Feel free to do that on your own.

Video: H264, 608x464 (1.31 AR), 950 Kbps, 30 Fps
Audio: AAC, Stereo, 130 Kbps
Notes: Source quality varies tremendously: some video segments are VHS quality (very soft, tracking lines), some video/picture segments are DVD quality. Great encode and release."
,mister_yuck,2012-05-01T21:09Z,"wtf are you guys complaining about?
