IMDB review: 

"A mysterious circus comes to the western town of Abalone bearing wonders and characters that entertain the inhabitants and teach valuable lessons."

The DVD Jacket says:

"WHICH FACE WILL THE WILY DOCTOR REVEAL TO YOU?   The mysterious traveling circus of Dr. Lao has come to the dusty Arizona town of Abalone. Everyone turns out for the magical event. None of them realize the circus they're attending is in their own minds.
The greed, vanity and pettiness of Abalone's citizenry gets an unexpected makeover, thanks to the life-altering showmanship of the venerable (7332 years young in October) Chinese impresario Lao. 
George Pal guides this beloved, imaginative fable which received an honorary Oscar for the makeup wizardry of William Tuttle. And 'in what may be the finest performance in a fantasy film' (Danny Peary, Guide for the Film Fanatic), Tony Randall plays Lao and his multitude of faces. Step inside the tent ... and marvel."
