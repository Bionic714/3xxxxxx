The Ultimate Superman Collection
========================

The Ultimate Superman Collection (also known as Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition and Superman: The Ultimate Collection) is a 14-disc DVD box set of Superman films (13 Disc box set outside of the US and Canada), released on November 28, 2006 by Warner Home Video. The set was withdrawn from stores shortly after its release due to a manufacturing error (see below for details). ""The Ultimate Superman Collection"" returned to shelves on May 29, 2007, with corrections made to the error.

It features all four Christopher Reeve films (made between 1978 and 1987), including the alternate Richard Donner cut of Superman II. It also contains the two other theatrical ""Superman"" films, Superman and the Mole Men starring George Reeves and 2006's Superman Returns, starring Brandon Routh. Additional material includes The Adventures of Superpup, the 1940s Superman cartoons produced by Fleischer and Famous Studios, and the documentary Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman.

The collection does not include the movie Supergirl, because its rights are, in part, controlled by a different company (although Warner Bros. now owns some ancillary rights). Supergirl was re-released separately to DVD also on November 28, 2006.
