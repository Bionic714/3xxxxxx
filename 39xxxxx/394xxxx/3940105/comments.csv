,DavaiTe,2008-03-06T07:30Z,"Audio is good.
Video is good.. but

Just about every episode in the list has serious digital shifts (like watching it on Satelite tv in a major rain storm).
Makes it jump forward a moment-to-several seconds and tends to throw the audio track out of sync."

had no problems while watching with vlc"
,roso91,2008-05-28T21:09Z,Some who know where I can find a torrent of season 14?
,JustTorrents,2008-05-29T03:01Z,"@roso:
I will release one when the single episodes aren't  well seeded anymore,

Does anyone know where I could get the season 12?"
,meh72,2010-06-20T23:50Z,"Thanks to the uploader!

And FWIW, 2nd half of episode 3 is pretty awful in terms of video quality and a/v sync"
