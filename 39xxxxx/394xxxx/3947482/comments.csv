,messedupmaybe,2008-03-24T20:02Z,"I have finished downLoading Friday 1.mp3 and Friday 2.mp3 ...
both seem to be the same first 3 and a half chapters.  Can anyone confirm (or deny) that this is a full good copy?  On other torrents I have seen the work of ""shills"" who bash a file when not true and the file is ok.  I have also heard of companies who upload crap to keep people busy wasting time downloading.  Thanks for seeding and for letting the file run after it is finished.  2008-03-24th"
