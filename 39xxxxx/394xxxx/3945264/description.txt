They call you Contract Jack-Just Another Contract Killer. 
You have a reputation for being able to solve problems, 
particularly in cases of questionable legality. 
But now you've got problems of your own.

The legendary chief assassin for H.A.R.M. organization 
has given you a mission-whether you want it or not. 
An Italian criminal organization has plans to take H.A.R.M. 
down and you must stop them.

In doing so, you'll contend with the deadliest enemies you've
seen and survive against ridiculous odds to complete your mission.
Intense firefights and cataclysmic predicaments are constant in this
exhilarating step forward for the No One Lives Forever franchise.
