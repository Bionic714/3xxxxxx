There is one thing in the instructions that you didnt tell us to do...
You say 3.: ""double click: MakeDesktopIcon.exe and start with..."" I just happened to click on the toed registry icon after clicking the makedesktop icon and added the registry. The ""install"" changed to play.

Now i can play this great game"

double click: Cjack-start.exe ( must be done )
this adds the correct regfile, YOU just answer with yes after exit from here (with esc btw)

double click: MakeDesktopIcon.exe and start with.
this makes a desktop icon to the game launcher .exe file... ( NOW displaying ""play"" instead ""install"")
