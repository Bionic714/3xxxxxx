,Nissetuda,2008-10-18T20:37Z,Simply the best ever collection production I've seen. Really great work
,Nissetuda,2008-11-13T21:35Z,"It's a rare 12"" version of ""Let 'em In"", the first McCartney 12"" ... it is a French import,
catalogue number - 2C 052 98062 Y. It has leopard skin cover and label, and identifies A & B sides as being ""Special Disco Mixes"". They are the standard length songs, and the only thing ""special"" about the mixes is the extra depth of sound that the 12"" single offers. "
