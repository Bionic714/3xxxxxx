,LezDawson,2008-08-19T21:22Z,"Thanks man.  I've just recently been getting into torrenting DivX (avi) movies, and have a DivX compatible DVD player that cost less than 50 quid.  I can't believe how good these movies look on a TV - very close to DVD quality, but fit on a CD, or several on a DVD!  Brilliant.
Thanks again."
