,mange620,2007-12-30T14:06Z,"Doesn´t work with PAL cameras as in all over Europe. Only NTSC as in North America.
Too Bad. Is there some kind of patch or something to make it work with PAL?"
,Koluda,2007-12-30T20:07Z,"Anyone who can confirm this ?
If it dosen´t support PAL it´s rater usless for me.

And to you all who completed the download, please help seed it , alot of leechers completed the download these last dayd and left the torrent without seeding....!!!"

,mmymy,2008-01-07T07:38Z,"can anybody please tell me how to mount this 3 folders because when I unrar them its not giving me an image files and where can i find this DISK2CYGiSOcrack.txt file?, and its not giving me an Ultimate version but Stdio plus only. When i tried to install it there are so many CRC errors that are popping out. please help."
,crb123456,2008-01-07T10:25Z,"@ mmymy
force recheck your torrent(just to make sure u have 100% download)...........you don't mount the folders..........what u have downloaded are RAR files ( eg *.r01or, *.r02 and so on).....u willl need software like WINRAR to extract your image (iso file )........u only need to extract from 1 file in each directory.....so u ony need to open 1 file from each of those 3 directories with say ( winrar)...then u should end up with 3 iso files..which you can mount on softwares like DAEMON tools....after mounting u can explore those iso files like any other windows folder/disc.....so the crack is inside the iso file that u would extract from disk 2 RAR file.....u can google for these guides on mounting / unrar-ing ...enjoy peace....."
,dacke_77,2008-01-10T21:10Z,"crb123456: I have the same problem. Everytime I click on an imported clip it says that it needs to activate dolby 2ch or something like that via internet. I have performed the tasks specified in crack.txt, but it doesnt help. Anyone else with this problem?"
,JoakimLj,2008-01-11T18:57Z,"I think it's this version I downloaded, not sure..
But if it is this one my Anti-Virus program (AVG) found two trojans in the keygen (first CD)"
,scarbs,2008-01-12T14:56Z,"Yes, I too found the trojans on the keygen - haven't used it therefore!

Any other suggestions about how to unlock and perhaps get Ultimate version of Studio 11?"
,crb123456,2008-01-14T19:58Z,MY AVG didn't find anything.....but found trojan in keygen from MAGNiTUDE release though.....anyway u could try running the keygen inside VIRTUAL PC......or i am sure i have seen a TxT file with all activitation codes somewhere in TPB ...it.....
,crb123456,2008-01-14T20:02Z,"@ dacke_77
...try replacing  that dll file in both places, as mentioned in crack txt again...and make sure you replace and overwrite...don't rename the old file ..."
,crb123456,2008-01-14T21:06Z,"@ dacke_77
 please ignore previous comment , i misread what u were saying.......in the keyen look for the  Dolby module  (or what ever module u want to activate) , from the drop down menu in the keygen........then click unlock ....and it will give u the relavent unlock code.........then insert that code in pinnacle help menu>>activate>.....that should do it....."
,pc8200,2008-01-15T18:46Z,"If you already have TStudio 11 plus version,just download Disk 2 to upgrade to Ultimater. It will save you alot of times."
,explodinghearts77,2008-02-02T22:47Z,I cant find the crack.txt thing either...Maybe I am just retarded. I dont know what to put in as the seriel number or anything. Can someone help me out please?
,explodinghearts77,2008-02-03T07:49Z,Ok I figured it out and this is amazing. It works perfect as long as you install it correctly. Make sure you meet system requirements before you spend all that time downloading though.

I've even heard a lot of professionals in video editing rate it higher than Premiere and AVID.

I'll let ya'll know if I manage to install this release in a few days."

Just hourglasses when I open these .rars (looking at .iso). Tried forcing an extract, it created directory with nothing in it....  Running AVG8.0 and Ad-aware now, nothing on them so far....  Any ideas / suggestions?"

Thanks..."
,BrodieCSX,2008-06-17T22:49Z,"There are a lot of .rar files. I have to extract every single one? do I extract them to separate folders or to the same place? There are no .iso files, am I supposed to create an .iso with all of the files in the Disc1 folder? I cannot find a crack file in disc2!

Can you please post installation instructions please! your directions were terrible... they just say unrar and burn the cd's... wth... even if its not the uploader SOMEBODY PLEASE POST SOME INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS!!"
,BrodieCSX,2008-06-18T03:46Z,"OK, crb123456, I just read some of your previous comments. So, there are SEVERAL .rar files in the disc1/disc2/disc3 folders BUT, what you are saying is that I only need to extract ONE of the files? Why are there so many files and which one should I use? it really doesnt matter??

Thanks"
