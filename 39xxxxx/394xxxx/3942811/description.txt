The plot of the movie is convoluted and rather loose. It concerns a priest who gathers together a group of boys, both American and European, and takes them to a beach on the Mediterranean Sea. There he has plans to stage a play based on the biblical book of Genesis.

Throughout the movie, the boys in question are frequently entirely nude and are shown frolicking in the surf, building shelters, driving a van and climbing up cliffs.

One national critic described the boys┬┤ anarchic revelry as a "dream-like descent from civilization into the chaos reminiscent of Lord of the Flies."
