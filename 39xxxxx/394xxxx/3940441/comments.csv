,qoncept,2009-01-30T23:54Z,Is this maux-dgr.1 file the same as a .iso file? I tried burning it on my Mac using iBurn360 like I've burnt a dozen other games and it didn't work.

,-brian-,2009-08-21T10:15Z,"I downloaded it, and instead of extracting the .rar files like usual, it just gave me a whole weird list that I have no clue what to do with, I had the MX vs ATV Unleashed for ps3 and liked it so I figured id get this one for 360 but if anyone wants to help a (kinda) noob out, ive already burned about 14 games so I know what im doing, just never seen this before. thanks"
