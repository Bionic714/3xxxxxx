,QuietGeek,2008-09-04T13:02Z,"Thx, josh.db, for this hard-to-find upload. But a few notes:

Three of the tracks have their names (and track numbers) switched. If you listen carefully to the lyrics and check the track lengths with those of online track listings, like at amazon and artistdirect, you'll see that:
1) ""08 Rece Cica.mp3"" should be renamed ""09 Slaughter Interlude.mp3"" - Length ~ 1:53
2) ""09 Slaughter Interlude.mp3"" should be renamed ""10 Heart Attack Feeling.mp3"" - Length ~ 6:39
3) ""10 Heat Attack Feeling.mp3"" should be renamed ""08 Rece Cica.mp3"" - Length ~ 4:31
The others are AOK, except maybe correcting ""12 Bikel Family Nign.mp3"" to ""12 Bikel Family Nigun.mp3"" (see how Nign redirects to Nigun at Wikipedia).

This album is a great-tasting borshtch of surprisingly competent Klezmer, Hip-hop/Rap, Electronica, and maybe 20 other genres mixed into each song. You should see SoCalled live in action - a bundle of energy and virtuosity, hopping from one instrument/beatbox/mixpanel to another. Whether you like this kind of mind-blowing mix (""World Beat"" in the truest sense) or not, the musicianship and daring here are undeniable.
