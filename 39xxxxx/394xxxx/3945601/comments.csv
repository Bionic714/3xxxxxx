,CanadaGuy28,2008-01-10T14:22Z,"I have been trying to get this completed since 12/23/07 at about 2:04 pm CST, I have successfully downloaded 3 other full movies, no problems. Any chance we can get a seed on this, just so all of us can complete the download. That would be great. My share ratio is already 1.796, I will seed until 2.00 at least, IF I can finish this download. Thanks for the up, hope it is worth the wait!"
,CanadaGuy28,2008-01-17T00:32Z,"Well, 12.23.07 is the date I started, I am and have been at 81.4% for the main duration of this. My share ratio is through the roof on what parts I have, currently over 72.00, I usually seed to 1.50 to 2.00. Be nice if I could get the last of the file, anyone who has this, PLEASE SEED! I cannot find another DVD9 image out there, and I don't have BlueRay yet."
,jekinney,2008-02-16T19:59Z,"Sorry about not seeding, had to move. But I am surprised, I know at least 8 people where at 100%... Please seed, at least a few days after you download. Thanks"
