,Kazuhiro9000,2008-01-01T02:53Z,WARNING: Do NOT download this if you intend to watch it on anything other than your computer. As the author has ripped the audio into an absurd format that 5 of my dvd burning applications failed to convert. This is only playable on a pc with the required codecs.
,glair,2008-01-01T06:52Z,"This will play fine with XBMC.

Thats what I use to watch this stuff on my TV."
,kmart,2008-01-02T22:01Z,"HAHAHA you fucking idiot Kazuhiro9000....
This is AC3 5.1 channel audio...
This is the original sound that is on a DVD you fucking idiot!

And to all the others, install FFDShow or view the Movie with VLC Player.
