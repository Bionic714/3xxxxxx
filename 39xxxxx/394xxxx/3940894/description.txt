               Album Info..:                                                                   
                                                                                               
          From the Crazy Horse anthem "Prisoners of Rock and Roll," to an electrified          
          "Pocahontas," from an epic performance of the guitar masterpiece "Danger Bird," to   
          explorations of new sonic frontiers during "Scattered" and "When You r Lonely Heart  
          Breaks," the specialness of the music on Year of the Horse can not be denied. Even   
          when the band strips its sound down to drums and acoustic guitars for "Mr. Soul" and 
          "Human Highway" (both recordings from the 1996 Bridge School Benefit), the Horse     
          power is still strong.
