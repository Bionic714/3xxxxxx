This is the 10 tracks ripped from the DVD performance. Oxygene was originally released in 1976. It set the the standard for all New Age Synthesizer Music that would follow.

"OXYGENE ? Live In Your Living Room is what Jean Michel Jarre has 
created to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his super-hit album and 
will come in 3 formats: CD album, CD+DVD, and CD+3D DVD. The 
stereoscopic 3D video and surround sound gives the unique 
impression of being right there next to Jean Michel and his instruments 
while seated on your living room sofa.

Jean Michel was accompanied by three musicians for this live 
performance, as the 8 track original masterpiece requires eight hands 
for a live performance. It was played totally live in one take, without 
tape or hard-disk playback, by himself and Francis Rimbert, Claude 
Samard and Dominique Perrier.

It is the first concert to be filmed in stereoscopy, which is the next 
giant step in audiovisual entertainment: Philips have developed a new 
plasma screen that delivers a 3D stereoscopy image visible without 
glasses - the film director James Cameron (Titanic) has patented a 
new stereoscopic movie camera and is to release his next movie in 
stereoscopic 3D.
