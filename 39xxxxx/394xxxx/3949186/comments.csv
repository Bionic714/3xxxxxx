,ballju,2007-12-29T05:11Z,"KeyGen doesn't work on tiger (10.4 intel) as well, is it because the KeyGen is corrupted and suppose to be zipped or is it a problem with my computer?"
,apfelman,2007-12-31T14:13Z,"I agree, keygen doesn't work on 10.5.1!"
,ballju,2007-12-31T21:22Z,"the keychain works fine its just that you have to make it an executable application 

Show package contents of ""KeyGen"", navigate to Contents -> MacOS ->keygen

Open a terminal type:

chmod +x [ and then path to keygen without the brackets]

you can just copy the keygen file into terminal and it will output the location/path to keygen The Avernum torrent had the same problem http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3953369/Avernum"

,rbbr17603,2008-04-17T12:20Z,I couldn't get it to work...followed instructions kept saying permission denied !!
,fins.gd,2008-06-15T17:21Z,"try:

sudo chmod +x path/to/keygen"
,clark686,2008-09-07T06:46Z,"This DOES work.
Here are the instructions in total 100% full for anyone struggling with getting it to work. If you like it you should go out and buy it, its worth it.

Once you have copied the VST's/AU's to the Plug-Ins folder go to the keygen, right click and go to 'show package contents' then go to Contents -> MacOS -> Keygen

Then, in a seperate window go to Applications -> Utilities and open the application called 'Terminal'

Once you are in terminal type in chmod +x (followed by a single space) then go back to the window with the keygen file.
Copy the keygen file and go back to terminal and paste it right where you had finished writing (after the space).
It should look something like chmod +x User/Documents/Azureus/etc.etc.
Then, hit ENTER.

The keygen will now be able to generate the registration for you.

Hope this helps anyway that was having any trouble."

,clark686,2008-09-07T06:50Z,pps. the keygen that you have to go to after you have done everything is the one at contents -> macOS -> keygen
