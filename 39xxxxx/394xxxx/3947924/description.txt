It's Christmas time in New York , and you are a cop, working for the New York Bio-hazard Team. And guess what? A raging virus has spread through the city, turning everyone into blood-crazed, flesh-hungry zombies. And guess what else? YOU are the last line of defense.

This Christmas is going to suck.

While normal New Yorkers either hide in fear, or get their faces ripped off by Infected zombies, you are out there working overtime. Armed with some brutal weaponry, and a special viral gun, you've got to blast, chum, and burn your way through the boroughs, killing everything that moves.
