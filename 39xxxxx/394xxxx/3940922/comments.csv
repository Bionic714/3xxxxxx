[T],st2580smile,2007-12-21T03:01Z,"In my research of The Beach Boys, I fell into the story of Manson and the Family (Dennis was one of for a short time). Interesting that Dennis brought Charlie to Terry Melcher who rented his home to Roman Polanski after a fall out with Manson and fled to Europe. Hmm, do you think Manson would have been as distrought and acted the way he did if Melcher and The Beach Boys had patronized him and his music? We will never know, but it is a fact and it did happen.
