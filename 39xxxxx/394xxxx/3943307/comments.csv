,nofait,2007-12-22T10:40Z,Well... who's word should we believe in?
,FTW2000,2007-12-27T20:26Z,As usual the problem with the book vs the movie. And if you have read the book dont count on any suprises. And Mckenncy caracter looks more like a skateboard punk playing in blinc 69 or what they call those crap bands then a serious detective. And the chick looks bland too in (). Thanks  for the share though.
