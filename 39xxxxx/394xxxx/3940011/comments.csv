,vaino666,2007-12-21T19:50Z,"I tested this from VIDEO_TS folder with Power DVD 7.3 and burned to disk with stand alone player. It worked fine. Other comments please, I would like to know what is the problem"
,MagnusRamone,2007-12-22T01:01Z,Hmm den funkade inte för mig...
,Juu...,2007-12-22T12:22Z,Millä ohjelmalla teet nää ripit?
,vaino666,2007-12-22T14:21Z,"Juu... asked me what programs I use.
Dvd Decrypter 
Dvd Remake Pro 3.53 for editing menus, commands etc.
Dvd Rebuilder Pro 1.26 for comppressing movie. With Rebuilder there is CinemaCraft encoder 2.72... retail and Avisynth frame server 2.58 beta.
RbFarm to connect several computers to compress one movie."
,coprod,2007-12-23T15:38Z,"No, this one is NOT working. Maybe you should check it before uploading. Try to make a fix. The VIDEO_TS.VOB is not there."
,vaino666,2007-12-24T00:48Z,"You are right. Media player and vlc player does not play it.  I was few days away. Now I'm playing it with PowerDVD 7.3 and it works. I also burned it to disk (5 mins ago) and it works with my old stand alone player. I gave one disk to my friend and her stand alone plaeyr plays it well. I'm wery sorry that I was too lazy to test it all player programs. 
I opened movie again with Dvd remake pro and run debugger and I found nothing wrong. Why Dvd Remake did not do VIDEO_TS.VOB I don't know. I exported it again and Dvd remake and it does not make VIDEO_TS.VOB. So I can't make a fix. Very sorry again."
,coprod,2007-12-30T05:08Z,Sometimes there is no VIDEO_TS.VOB. Thanks for the effort anyway and keep up the good work. Maybe you should try Media Player from the VIDEO_TS folder next time to see if it's ok. 
,vaino666,2007-12-30T23:27Z,"I almost decide to quit releasing movies. My windows made updates and mediaplayer did't work any more. It said that I have pirate XP hah haa.
If I release some movie you can be sure that I test them all the players and give some copys to my friends to test.
I updated my programs. Rebuilder pro to version 1.26.5 and Cinecraft Encoder to version SP2 v1.00.00.08. So further testing is more important.
This movie there is somethin wrong in VTS_08_0.IFO. I can change it. Madiaplayer classic plays it then but VLC player still crashes.
So no fix. I could have made this easy way, just hide some blocks and compress. I tried to make this hard way without compressing."
