This one was nice becouse when I removed everything unnecessary, I didn't have to compress the video. Video is original. I also could keep all three language menus. Menus are now fast. No animation between menus.
If you don't need extras this is then better you can buy from store. Same video and audio quality, no warnings etc. and fast menus.

When you look the source VTS 7 progran chains are 4053 MB same than my version.
In original There was 32 VTS now only 9. I edited manually PGC commands.
I compared this to other releases and checked one VOB file with Bitrate viewer.
0.99 GB VTS_07_3.VOB Avarage bitrate: 5391 and Peak: 8385
