,BikerTrash2003,2008-01-06T16:25Z,"Next time you request help with a file, try not being such an asshole."
,rosta420,2008-01-22T07:27Z,Hey. Im new to this torrent thing. How do i get these files to play on my computer or even my home dvd player????
,BikerTrash2003,2008-01-23T02:34Z,"You need to use an DVD authoring software such as Nero Express. There are many programs out there that can burn the vob files onto an DVD disk. Might I suggest visiting http://www.supermediastore.com/burningdvdtips.html#burning%20dvd%20video

This will get you started. It is one of many websites out there to instruct you on how to burn DVDs. Also try a web search for Burn dvd, etc.

Good Luck"

,picards_envy,2008-03-02T02:41Z,Quick Question: Is Live Free the unrated version or the PG-13 version?
,KOATV,2008-03-07T01:06Z,"I too am new at this game... however, I'm using a Mac with Toast Titanium.  So how does the process work?  Do I convert the torrent in Azureus & then set the file to encode in my Toast or does it go as a ""copy""?"
,pflagger,2008-03-09T10:40Z,"Nero Express is not a ""DVD authoring program"".  The process of DVD authoring is actually producing the VOB files.  Nero Express just burns them to disc.  And that's all you need to do here, as all four movies will fit onto one DVD5 each.  Select ""DVD Video"" as the type when burning."
,D4V1D13,2008-10-27T16:44Z,"Hey!! How can i make the file that i burn to the DVD disc?.. Have i to make all files for Die Hard 1 to 1 file and all files for Die Harder to 1 file and some for 3 and 4?.. If anyone knows how i have to do, Please help me. I really want to see this ""Movie""... :/"
