,TheBombio,2008-04-20T04:08Z,"Thanks.

This is like the funny parts that didn't make it on to Jackass Number 2. Which I found funny (both this movie and the Jackass Number 2).

Perfect quality."
,oriks,2008-12-08T03:58Z,Come on guys seed. Good movie can't wait to watch but I'm going to have to because people don't seed. Thanks for upload man :D
,joethehoe,2010-03-27T02:51Z,I haven't watched this yet but didn't they just use film from when they shot number 2? that would mean that this wasn't even good enough for the deleted scenes right? and THIS movie has deleted scenes too?
,rimsmash,2010-10-01T01:16Z,i dont get it is jackass 2.5 different the the other 2 or is just a bunch of scences from the other ones
,ThreeMoreBowls,2010-10-22T06:23Z,"2.5 is ""new"" scenes.  Pretty much whatever they filmed for Jackass 2 and didn't use, they made into 2.5.  So to answer all your questions that could have been answered simply by googling, Jackass 2.5 is it's own movie, not a collaboration of old scenes from earlier movies or the TV show."
