Iraq documentary from good ole England called 'Dispatches: the death squads" - IMDB info. really give no info. this time...is mostly about insurgent squads of iraqi people involved in a civil war we seemed to have begun, or at the very least did not stop from happening.  Not nearly my favorite, but if you've watched this far then...
