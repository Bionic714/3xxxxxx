It literally is the world map with quite a generous amount of info Locations (some cases slightly misspelt), Boarders, Rivers and lakes, Main streets, national and municipal roads (of every country! - probably need so updating but still useful).

This map won't interfere with the map you have already installed on Garmin if you place the world map on a memory card (because Garmin only accepts one map upload at a time and because this is pre-unlocked you and fuse them together, or at least I don't think you can).

Gets a little a memory lapse at 800m but I assume that also depends on the prowess of your Garmin."
