,SparkySnarky,2010-06-10T01:55Z,"@Faergens because this is ""The Obadiah Parker Live album downloaded from iTunes and stripped of DRM with QTFairUse"". iTunes downloads = .m4a"
,SyrinXeno,2011-10-07T14:01Z,"Thanks a lot, but could you please upload it again in higher quality than 128 kBit/s?"

thanks"
