,713tex,2008-01-12T23:41Z,Yes  you do. You need to be able to mount the image.
,713tex,2008-01-12T23:42Z,People also need to SEED.
,713tex,2008-05-06T04:14Z,"I was thinking...
this file isn't .rar'ed...
should it be?
Maybe it'll make for a quicker download. I'm not really sure if it'll make any differnce.
What do think, should I delete this torrent and up a new one?"

,G49HD,2010-01-26T05:43Z,"raring it might would make it a quicker download because its compressed,making these big files into one small file. but i can see its been uploaded a while so I wouldn't worry about doing it now"
,G49HD,2010-01-26T05:44Z,"nevermind,you did rar it."
