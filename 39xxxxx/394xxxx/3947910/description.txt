The show that FOX Network deemed too outspoken and brash for prime time, and which it ultimately dropped from its roster, has since experienced record DVD sales and become the most-watched show ever aired on the Cartoon Network. Among many other distinctions, the animated family series goes where even THE SIMPSONS fears to tread, with its bumbling oaf of a father, outcast teenage daughter, beefy blockhead son, urbane alcoholic dog, and murderous baby with plans for world domination. 

This collection features five episodes handpicked by creator Seth MacFarlane, which comprise his personal favorites:
