,mitkir,2008-01-01T12:31Z,There are no seeds :-(
,miketheking6,2008-01-02T04:35Z,stuck at 89% please seed a good move for the new year! thank you! and happy new year.
,~Green~Fire~,2008-01-04T20:18Z,"Sorry....But this is what happen when people don't seed....It dies.
I saw that almost 30 something people got this one
down and only one of them seeded it so I got
pissed and did stop to seed it leaving it up to those
who got it that did not share it onwards.

The world of Torrents do only work if people
share what they down....

Sorry to all who missed this....but don't blame
me....blame them who did not seed this one.

Peace*

seeded it for you....but when I got pissed I deleted
it and really do not feel like make another RIP right
