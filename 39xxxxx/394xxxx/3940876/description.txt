The F-14A Tomcat is our debut design from Stephen Vernava, one of IRIS? most dedicated model developers. The F-14 Tomcat has been a labor of love for Stephen and the model shows this, from the authentic and highly detailed exterior to the in depth virtual cockpit, this model truly shines above all other IRIS products. 

It?s not only the modeling which has taken a leap forward in this product, but we have had the honour of being provided with textures from Dag Roger Stangeland and Jens-Ole Kjoelberg, both well known and established artists. 

However the real treat for Tomcat fans in this aircraft is not just the cosmetic details, but also the inner workings of the product. Utilizing XML code in the 3DS Max model and having the talents of Rob Barendregt on board, we have been able to provide you with what has been popularly deemed as the first successful modeling of a switchable wingsweep system. The wingsweep system in this F-14 can be selected by the user to work in automatic or manual mode with separate control of the flaps. 

As usual, the Tomcat features a plethora of loadouts, textures and animations such as exits, boarding ladders, intake ramps, exhaust nozzles, flaps, slats, spoilers and more. Also included are a great number of effects, which are sure to please the eye. 

We have also once again had the privilege to employ the sound genius of Christoffer Petersen who has provided us with some excellent sounds for the Tomcat which I am sure will have you playing with that volume control! 

Below is a brief summary of the product and be sure to visit the screenshots forum to view our latest images of this magnificent aircraft.
