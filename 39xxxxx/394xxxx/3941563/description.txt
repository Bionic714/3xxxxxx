Awesome little timer program that can be set for up to 100 hours then counts down and sounds an alarm which can be any wav, mp3, mdi file, or one of several built-in sounds. It can be sent to your System tray or minimized while counting down then pops up and sounds the alarm when time expires. It has a cool customizable interface and can also be used as an alarm clock to wake you up in the morning, complete with "snooze" feature.
