Synopsis: After the Eight-Nation Alliance Army occupies Beijing (see Part 4) and with the Qing Dynasty's fall imminent, Wong Fei Hung, his family and disciples return to South China in order to move to Hong Kong . As they arrive at the port town, Wong and disciples find the town totally empty, as the local government official had left with all the government funds, leaving the local army garrison without money or food. This situation is made worse by the pirates that were terrorizing the coast, cutting off the sea route.
