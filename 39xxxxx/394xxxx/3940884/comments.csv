This is not a comment, but I didn't know where to place this, since the forum link doesn't work.

Could someone please seed this Torrent for a little while? I'm stuck at 79.9% and would really like to have this game!

Thank you very much!
Groovy J"

We are generally 4 peers in these day but no completes DLs among us.
So if something have the full archive or an other file to propose, seed it and we thank you all.

See you soon :)"
