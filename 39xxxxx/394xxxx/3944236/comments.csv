,Ravanas,2008-02-19T09:39Z,"Okay, so first, some praise...  Many thanks for the torrent!  Great to have some of this stuff.  Quality is fantastic considering what it is.  

However, MANY of the files are mislabeled.  Between the various sources I've been using (track lists, lyric sites, etc) I've managed to sort most of it out.  But not all.  I'm still working on it.  In other words, if you like accuracy in your tags/filenames, I'd tell you to look elsewhere ....  if you could find this.  So instead I'll just warn you to be prepared for some annoying frustration to get it right.

Anyway, despite the problems I'm having, thanks for the up.  :)"

Thanks for the upload >B:)
You should have labeled it CRASS Discography. Just so that people know, even if it's not complete. ;)"
