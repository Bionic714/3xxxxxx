,evilBrad,2007-12-27T05:11Z,"i have a friend that has another copy of this......sucked.................this is a DVD quality copy

audio needs to be a bit high but i'll sacrifice audio for quality

thanks elcapitano111 great copy!"
,elcapitano111,2007-12-27T13:18Z,"@evilBrad...The audio is top quality, it's just that the quiet sounds are quiet and the loud sounds are, well, loud. I suggest you sit with the remote in-hand for it, unless you want to disturb the neighbors during loud scenes ;).....

Please remember to comment, and seed :D
Thanks"
,elcapitano111,2007-12-27T13:24Z,"Why aren't the seeders/leechers numbers correct?....I have 106 seeders and 797 leechers, even though it says here that there are 60 seeders and 3 leechers...numbers can be deceptive, so don't be put off by the numbers at the top, there are many more than it says :D"
