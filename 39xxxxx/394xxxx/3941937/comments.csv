,MgZ,2007-12-21T01:37Z,Does this need the original GH2 or does this play all by itself ? TY !
,Shorty1038,2007-12-21T01:41Z,"The game itself is GH2 except the songs are different.
It runs by its self it does not need the original copy. "
,creuss,2007-12-21T04:06Z,Expert only?
,Shorty1038,2007-12-21T04:48Z,"On most of them
I think the exceptions are

School of Rock
Operation Ground and Pound
What's This (FOB Version)

And those are E-M-H-X"
,Shorty1038,2007-12-21T20:36Z,"O and I forgot to mention comment what you think of my custom.

,CasperLT1,2007-12-28T05:39Z,"Nice,plays fine.Songs are sweet,a few charts a little off but what do you expect.Overall,one of the best custom Guitar Hero's I've came across.Thanks"
,Securis,2007-12-30T04:16Z,"It freezes on me whenever a song ends, and I go to play a new song. :-/ Anyone know how to fix this? There a certain mode it have to run in with HDLoader?"
,CoachP,2007-12-30T08:07Z,I am currently fixing a good custom disc with all EMHX songs as the main tracks and the extras will be mainly expert only... its easy to follow tutorials on scorehero.
,Shorty1038,2007-12-31T00:53Z,"RE:Secruis

its done that to me a couple times and I have no idea why it does that.

But it goes away after a while."
,knasen_nr1,2008-01-13T15:38Z,wtf!!! its like crap dude!! why is it just five notes in the beginnig of the songs and nothing more??
,Shorty1038,2008-01-14T22:09Z,"RE: knasen_nr1
thats because your a noob and are playing it on something other then expert.
almost all songs are EXPERT ONLY!"
,No0n3,2008-01-21T16:47Z,"Nice custom disc, I like the bonus tracks :D"
,No0n3,2008-01-21T20:39Z,"By the way, that ""Break in city"" chart is made by me. :P"
,lankeykong,2008-01-24T06:47Z,Do ps2's come with the ability to play burned disks or is there a TuT on how to do it. If there is if someone could post a link to a nice one.... or tell me that you need one. Thanks :)
,iv4nng,2008-01-25T12:18Z,"this is crap. only one song Damnit (Blink 182) can play. The others song do not have play button, only can hear the song."
,Twan,2008-01-26T07:15Z,"Works fine, but sometimes freezes after songs. Wouldn't be a big deal if I didn't have a mem card, but otherwise I can never play more than Foo Fighters.

Shorty - How do I unlock all songs?"
,lankeykong,2008-01-26T20:36Z,"I can get it to open on my pc, but it lags alot. any ways to make it lag less or do i jsut have to play it on a ps2?"
,pokecal,2008-01-30T23:44Z,I do NOT suggest that you download this. Shorty obviously did not even test this custom disc himself or he would have found the fatal flaw with his dtb editing. There are WAY to many grammatical mistakes and this most of the songs have poor/low quality. For better results make your own custom disk (scorehero.com) or check out the Guitar Hero 2 Hacked Again Custom disc.
,Shorty1038,2008-02-02T00:16Z,"Hey pokecal
FUCK YOU!!!
last time I checked you dont get a custom GH2 disc to worry about grammatical errors, you get it for CUSTOM SONGS!!
and thats what this is.
If you are gonna worry about grammatical errors then CRY ME A RIVER!!!"
,chocolatemaster317,2008-02-18T11:06Z,"Hey pokecal: '' There is grammatical faults'' 
if you like to download games and search for grammatical faults its your problem, 
WE DONT NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR MISERABLE LIFE!!!!!!!!"
,Nyphenth,2008-03-02T19:13Z,"make this Costom with E-M-H-EX, then it a good Custom, not just expert and fix the bugs"
,timstangnes,2008-03-03T22:17Z,does this works on nintendo wii??? here was the many good songs . !!
,McM1337,2008-03-14T21:46Z,"To unlock all songs, press blue three times. This is possible because this was made from Kariodudes disc.

By the way, this freezes sometimes. It's an awesome disc, but that error is pretty bad."
,pimpson90,2008-03-18T23:31Z,hey im a noob at this...i clicked download his torrent and it came out really small...like 20 KB! is this right? if not what do i do to download the content? PLEASE HELP!
,chuckstaton,2008-03-22T10:09Z,Will someone please port this to 360?!
,sitaric,2008-03-24T21:35Z,"BORING ! it doesnÂ´t work ..

,BOB2003,2008-03-31T17:12Z,"is a shit!!! many many lag freez!!!

Criss que ces pas drole osti, pas etre capable de mettre juste des chose qui marche bien!!
Je ne peux pas croire qu'il a du monde qui joue a ca comme ca avec tout ce freez et ces bug et lag...."
,shredder85,2008-03-31T19:25Z,"Bah, I get severe freezing on almost every song, pluss abnormal loading times, but from the comments it seems it works fine for some. maybe I'll have to try a different brand of dvd's."
,McM1337,2008-04-04T18:31Z,"ffs, sitaric, I said that the unlock all code is blue blue blue."
,JPisani,2008-04-11T23:53Z,"Hi, I have a couple questions...

1. I just finished downloading this and all it says is FILE... the other custom I downloaded says RAR FILE... Is this okay?

2. Does it matter if it's DVD-R or DVD+R?

3. Do I just put the DVD in the ps2 or do I have to use the slide card and all that?

Thanks!"
,Norwegian_Sondre,2008-04-28T08:24Z,"The game its totaly not working.
Its the red screen says.
INPUT PS OR PS2 GAMES PLEASE."
,miewies,2008-05-14T19:47Z,"This is THE WORST DISC i have ever seen. Don't you do any fucking quality control before you make something? a good portion of the songs are offsync... some songs have hugely distorted mp3's, most of the text strings that were edited are fucking retarded now. oh and it freezes after every single song. NOT WORTH YOUR DOWNLOAD BANDWIDTH DONT EVEN BOTHER

It's a good setlist but that cant outweigh how shitty everything else about the disc is."
,zackey,2008-05-18T09:46Z,"Where are you from shorty? ive added songs to it but when i am tt CD/DVD generator i dont know wich 1 i should take at volume. (Japan, Europe, North America) plz tell where you are from!"
,datagjord,2008-05-24T20:12Z,I WILL NOT DOWNLOAD IT CUZ ALL COMMENTS.
,Zephyr618,2008-06-08T23:44Z,Every single chart is terrible and off-sync... I don't recommend you waste a blank DVD-R on this...
,steini777,2008-06-14T13:24Z,does the songs have their custom title in the game?
,blink182awa,2008-07-16T04:20Z,"File is not downloading, halp??? seed plox?!?!?!"
,Dawee,2008-07-21T19:39Z,Is it expert only?
,SAMj.deb,2008-08-10T10:56Z,"Garbage!
Save your bandwidth like miewies said"
,danne_l97,2008-09-14T12:20Z,thanx man it rock special green day
,wabbo,2008-10-07T17:32Z,"it worked, but it was not a very good custom disk. I didn't like the note charting on some songs.. Worth trying though."
,wzzupp548,2008-11-07T04:43Z,"Very nice upload. Few songs get off sync. But seems very well made. I also have the freezing problem, sometimes not often (since im running off of hard drive).....when i was using swap disc I had the problem more often"
,Andyneo,2009-01-29T20:18Z,Doe's not work - i downloaded 7 burnt but when songs are on the fret is lit but no notes appear??? tried 4 songs on all levels the only 1 that worked kept freezing and was on GOD level !!! What a waste of time.
,Rovelius,2009-07-12T20:09Z,Crappy bands.
,sanoblue,2009-10-09T07:51Z,PLEASE SEED
