,np114,2008-02-29T22:41Z,"Downloaded the pack, and I was really disappointed at first, most of these things are either really easy to do yourself and only take space, or just really ugly (unless you design flyers for some cheezy 60's  club).

I was a little happier when I discovered the Custom Shapes and Tools however, those are really handy."
