,FilboidStudge,2008-01-08T20:15Z,"Monumentally awful film. Yet another embarrassingly cringeworthy Brit gangster film, only this one really outdoes the rest in the pathetic stakes."

,superpeden,2008-01-09T18:51Z,"Great Quality, Great download, GREAT movie !"
,BrenJames,2008-01-09T21:42Z,"Brilliant film! Great picture and sound. It shows what it's really like to live in the shit-hole called England. Any large town has many thugs like this. The police are afraid of them and take DAYS to respond to 911 calls. Their ages start from about 10 upwards and you'll see them on the streets every night! Intimidating, vandalising, smoking , drinking and worse. "
,Gollom27,2008-01-09T23:48Z,"Yeah in Blighty we use 999, not 911. Decent film based on a true story. If you liked Football Factory not the poor American influenced Green Street then you'll like this. "

,GiN613,2008-02-02T23:24Z,What a dire film. Great quality but you're better off with something that has a real plot and doesn't need to put in some huge fight scene every 2 minutes.

ViDEO = 738 kbps XviD

This was fine 2 years ago but now H.264 outclasses XviD by some margin.

700Mb rips of movies that are 2 hours long with XviD... you can tell its XviD if you compare to a H.264 :)

I am grabbing the 720p one of the Blu-Ray (its a 4Gb rip so you can imagine the quality!) to convert that to a 700Mb x264 and lets see."
,stenna_215,2010-02-25T09:41Z,"What carries this film is Ricci Harnett's performance as the gangster ""Carlton Leach"", he gets the part just right. Also there's a great performance from Craig Fairbrass playing the role of ""Pat Tate"". This is one of the better movies about the UK's criminal underworld."
