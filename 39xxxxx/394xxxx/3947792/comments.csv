This is just another closed site and once they reached their limit nobody else is allowed to join what is the point of that.

I have just joined a closed site myself my opinion only fucking boring you can only upload what they say and you must do it their way or not at all..

That's why I miss Demonoid because you could download files even if you wasn't a member and yes I was a member.
So thank you for your link but no thank you.."

,Trelew,2008-01-06T09:10Z,"Much Appreciated Oneanight!  Here in Canada we are just going through the midpoint of Season 3 of Dr Who and Season 1 of Torchwood.  It's nice to see something new.  Thanks

I share your statement about Demonoid, and I miss it too.  No slight intended to the fine pirates here, but when the corporate powers-that-be use their dirty tricks to take down a torrent site, they deminish us all!  "
