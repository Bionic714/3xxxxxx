Top Gear presenter James May delves into the archives in a multi-layered investigation into his siblings' favourite toys. Part social study and part tale of brotherly revenge, James' quirky journey sets about testing his theory that toys reveal as much about the nation that embraced them as any history book. More importantly, he aims to discover whether the girls' toys he never understood, such as prams, can be turned into something more useful - like a go-kart.
