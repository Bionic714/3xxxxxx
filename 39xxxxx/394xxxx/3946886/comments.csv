,SonnyRey,2007-12-26T15:53Z,"??? Where is the serial?  Downloaded files was a ""Delta Force Xtreme.iso"" file which I burned onto a CD-R.  In running it from the CD-R, the program demands a serial number, which I could ot find.  The is also a DJV9MED.exe so I executed that into my new DFX folder  But then there is no .exe file.  I ran each o fthe six update files and still no .exe file.  The PDF file that was extracted is not clear because it states""Make a new Folder for your modded DFX.""  I made a DFX folder but what is a ""modded"" DFX?  Please point me in the right direction.  Thanks in advance. ~bob"
,fibershark,2007-12-26T17:06Z,"You do not need a serial.
You need a valid cd-key only to play online.

There is a special MOD included.(DJV9MED)
Copy your map and rename it (e.g. DFX-V9)
Run DJV9MED.exe

You don't have too install this MOD!
I like DFX just the way it is.

Have fun Bob

,Stephoon,2007-12-26T23:29Z,I can't start the game! I don't understand how to install the updates? Does anyone have some more info about how to handle the updates?
,fibershark,2007-12-27T00:03Z,"1) mout or burn disk
2) install game- dont mind the cd-key, you only need it for online gaming
3) run dj3up06.exe and browse for the DFX directory (eg c:/program files/novalogic/DFX) and press install.

,honestgreen,2008-01-01T23:13Z,"can't get it working, keeps saying 
installation corrupted uninstall and reinstall. so I uninstalled and reinstalled like 3 times, tried letting the game up date, followed the directions posted, still couldn't get it to work, crazy. I used DAEMON tool, mounted it, installed, etc... any ideas? btw running stupid ass VISTA, which could also be the problem."
,honestgreen,2008-01-02T03:31Z,"ok, this is what I did to get the game to work for me. Uninstalled everthing for the game, reinstalled, then when it got the the KEY CODEs, which I found some: DFX-WESTIL-LKICKY-OURASS-ANYDAY, I put it in and then the game worked fine. Even let the game update its self."
