,jimbob22,2007-12-23T07:52Z,this works great to play on cracked servers but my million dollar question is will it let me set up a LAN game?
,jimbob22,2007-12-23T07:55Z,last crack - you could set up the game but not join.
,sacredflash,2008-01-20T18:56Z,"HELP PLEASE!!!!!

I got the cod4 multiplayer working but I join a server than it tells me the Server disconnected which is NOT the case(there are 40 people actively on the server) what do I do :(.

I feel like a newbie right now"

You need to join a cracked server. You can find a list here; http://www.epcgaming.com/epcgaming_v2/servers.php?gameid=16&page=1&sortby=CurrentPlayersLive&order=DESC
Just use xfire or something or start call of duty 4 and type in console ( `) /connect 83.133.124.64:28961"
,mofoelite,2008-04-28T23:09Z,"206.222.26.18:28960 cracked server pb is on so no hacks allowed

make sure you update your game to 1.5"
