[T],st2580smile,2007-12-20T21:31Z,"Ah, the Dennis and Brain ""Cocaine"" sessions. or as we in the Beach Boy circle call the ""Hamburger Sessions"".

I have tons of rare recordings by The Beach Boys as well as Brian's productions/guest apperances and I need to share them.

If you  search You Tube for st2580smile you will find my Shindig! Christmas special featuring The Beach Boys from 1964."

Well... in any case if you keep uploading it to me, I will keep it on my hosting forever! I see that it probably won't take much of my bandwidth as I am the only one leeching at the moment. Thanks."
,ProfessorQ,2012-06-22T18:30Z,These tracks are mp3 @ 160k/s in case anybody was wondering.
