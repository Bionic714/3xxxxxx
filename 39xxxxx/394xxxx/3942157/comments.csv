,jjsasha,2007-12-21T19:52Z,"thanks for this!!!!!!!!!!   I am from Tampa Bay and back 20 years ago ronnie B. was in a radio show called The Ron & Ron Show.  It was the biggest thing in Tampa at the time.  They used to be edgy and hillarious.  Hey Boston John If you dig funny talk radio also checkout a guy name Phil Hendrie. The premise to his show is phil will have a contraversial guest on his show and that guest will piss  off the audience. People call in yelling at the guest he has on not knowing that it is really phil (the host that's interviewing) doing the voice of the guest. But only Phil's true fans know that it's really Phil  interviewing himself and doing the voices of the host and the guest.  all the voices that you hear are phil and what makes it amazing is how phil can improv and bounce from voice to voice live and smoothly asking and answering questions... it's hard for me to explain but download some of phil hendrie's radio shows and tell me  what you think.  I think he's totaly original and a real talent.....  I love comedy talk radio like ron &fez, Howard Stern, the love doctors, Bubba the love sponge but Phil Hendrie is by far my favorite....
