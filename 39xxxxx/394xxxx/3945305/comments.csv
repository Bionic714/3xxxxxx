,Peasemold,2009-01-21T23:05Z,"But is this not available free from Analog Devices? From their website: ""With NI Multisim? Analog DevicesÂŽ Edition, ADI and the NI Electronics Workbench Group equip circuit board designers with a free, downloadable version of NI Multisim tailored for evaluating ADI components"""
,that1guy112,2009-03-06T03:39Z,"I downloaded and installed it with no problem.  But I forgot to activate it or whatever I need to do til i hit the max. number of components.  Now I'm not sure how.  I use the keygen to create .lic files and save them to the shared\License Manager\Licenses foler, but non of them work when I go into the licenese manager and try to install the file.  What do I do?"
,ahol,2009-06-12T17:31Z,"@that1guy112: Select one of the following methods to install your license:

1. Select OptionsÂťInstall License File from the menu and choose one or more license files to install. 
2. Select one or more license files in Windows Explorer and drag them onto NI License Manager tree. "
,Delfistyaosani,2010-01-22T17:07Z,"Generated and installed lic file but works in trial mode anyway, WTF?"
,zhennessy,2010-02-26T20:15Z,"I wish i had a step by step guide to tell me how to use the  license generator because i thought this would work like a regular keygen????? i am using multisim but it gives me a number of days i have left to ""evaluate"" how can i make this go away???
