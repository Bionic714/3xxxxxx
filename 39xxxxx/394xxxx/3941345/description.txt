\"Tripod are an Australian comedy band from Melbourne, who are slowly making themselves known elsewhere. They have a small following in the UK and a trickle of fans in the USA.
Tripod consists of Scod, Gatesy and Yon.

They\'re well known for their \'Song In An Hour\' challenges on Australian radio station Triple J. Once a week they appeared on the morning show with Wil Anderson and Adam Spencer and were given a list of \'ingredients\' from the listeners. They would then have only an hour to write a song containing all those ingredients.\"
