So I was glad to se this torrent. But I do not know how to use it. If I mount it in Deamon nothing happens. I can explore the files in the folder D.
Any advise?"
,treebuey,2008-01-06T07:02Z,"Apparently this is either a a component of or IS something called Universal Imaging Utility 2.0. his seems to be used to deploy the same system setup for Many different hardwared PCs within a large entity. THUSyou need as many drivers as you can get. 

This is great for for us that have to play around  with alot of older machines but can't always find the driver. seems to support XP and 2000. just pop it in  when XP asks for a driver search path.

UIU 2.0 is not new so keep that in mind. the last driver seems to be dated  2006. 

the newest UIU is 3.5 and allegedly supports Vista/XP
