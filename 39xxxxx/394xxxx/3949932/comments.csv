I have installed it and my key worked fine.

However, it asks me to register it online (or you will loose it within 30 days). Therefore I tried this, I even called the number... and then my program got lost (because the serial prolly allready were registered to a real customer allready).

Anyway to fix this?

I want a lifetime program. :)"

There is a keygen but where are is the license keys???? Downloading this is a equivalent to going to the adobe site to download the trial version. Thanks a bunch sdnquality"

,.el.greco,2008-01-13T20:56Z,"In the zipped file (!) there is a how to install, which actually doesnt say anything. Then there's a ""Keygen"" so to speak, which doesnt even run. I suspect it's a virus, will check in a second. And there's a dubious exe which starts the installation of PremPro. BUT, it tells me to close all internet explorer windows. I didnt have any open! The install prog refuses to continue installing. I guess this is a bad piece of torrent. "

That's dĂŚlme not so good..."
,TheBassplayer,2008-03-30T18:32Z,"Beware, there is a Trojan in this torrent which is disguised as the keygen application.  Oh and there really is no keygen in this package, so its basically a limited functionailty (no HDV Support) 30 day demo.  ...Waste of bandwidth IMO"
