Stuntman Mike, a former Hollywood stunt race car driver, invites a woman for a ride in his stunt film *deathproof* car. What the woman does not know is that it is only deathproof for the driver. The stuntman likes smashing women up. In the first sequence, the he targets a group of women whom he knows and successfully turns them to pulp. In the second sequence, he attemps to do the same to some bad girls and it turns out that they are not good victims because they fight back. Their tormentor ends up getting a taste of what he dishes out.

This is not a real thriller because there is almost no suspense and gory stuff and the girls end up winning against the evil stuntman. It is definitely a *C* movie, but a nice flick to watch with a chick in your arms who does not like watching women always be the victims.
