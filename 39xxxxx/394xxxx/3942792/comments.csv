classic muscle cars, and a crazy bastard with a thing for killing innocent chicks.  The final showdown is a deathrace between a charger and a challanger.   nuff said, wheres your balls at?"

Use your fucking brains before making comments please.

Just because you haven't downloaded the movie doesn't make it a fucking fake!

AND JUST TO MENTION THAT ooSTEVO HAS NOT UPLOADED ANYTHING YET HIMSELF, SO THIS JERK IS OBVIOUSLY A FAKER HIMSELF!

,whojanikabollikoff,2008-03-29T15:03Z,Quality is v poor thanks for seeding all the same
,For_what_its_worth,2008-04-01T06:46Z,"Hey Whojanikabollikof, at least half of the movies that I have downloaded here have worse quality.
The sound trailer is synchronized correctly, the movie is jacked from a DVD, which is not the same as DVD quality. If you want DVD quality, go rent it from a DVD shop or ask someone to put it up here as a DVD.

More than half the people that leech here don't seed anything. You're one of them (at least at the time of my writing), so who the hell are you to complain?!!"
,ogopogo,2009-01-09T22:45Z,leechers that do not seed should not be allowed to download!
