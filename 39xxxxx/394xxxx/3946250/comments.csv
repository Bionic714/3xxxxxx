Try search on torrent sites for cdg burning kits e.g How to burn karaoke"

,EzeRoss,2007-12-27T16:43Z,"Sorry folks I am struggling to keep this one flowing, please be assured that while I am awake I will be trying to maintain a decent flow,but my system is not handling it well.
Quick vote, what is the best torrent system to use?
I use Bit Comet's latest. Maybe I should try azureus. Am open to suggestions.
All the best,

,TheChadMan,2008-01-01T01:52Z,aaaaaarrrrrrrrrr....... i've waited 6 days for this... and already upped 17gb wtf?
,teachya,2008-01-01T04:15Z,Thank you very much EzeRoss.  This looks like an awesome share.  Patience is usually rewarded -  I have waited many months for some files to complete downloading  -  what's the hurry anyways??  Cheers buddy.
,TheChadMan,2008-01-01T13:04Z,"you shouldn't really up a torrent if you're not prepared to leave your pc on 'til its up to 100%.  It's easy to leave your pc on, and when you've upped your file then it's down to the rest of the community to keep it going. C'mon EzeRoss, lets get this one done............"
,EzeRoss,2008-01-01T16:34Z,"Happy New Year everyone. 100% has been achieved. Patience was the way. Sorry it took so long , but unlike some I don't get to wear the trousers all the time and with the comp being in the bedroom the wife insists that the comp is turned off while she sleeps.
Thank you all for seeding and I will upload in smaller portions from now on.
Have a great 2008
