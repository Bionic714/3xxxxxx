Let's work together and bring this classic back to life :)

Also, sign the petition and get the other episodes released :)"
,Colt69,2007-12-25T18:35Z,"Well if PirateBay is correct - there is only one seeder (me) and 27 leechers.

I am not set up to seed well, I am on a poor line.

I will need help to seed this! 

It is a substantial release! ""The State"" was a generation X classic, it was NEVER released on DVD, ever. The only way to see it was to trade crappy VHS copies around, and by now I bet they are all gone. Then out of nowhere Amazon and Itunes were selling the downloadable S1, but these files were not portable player friendly, infact you had to install a host of crappy software just to view them. Now they have been converted and you can watch them on DVD, you can sign the petition and help to get the other seasons released on DVD as they should be.

,ToadKills,2008-03-25T02:34Z,"Guys Please-please-PLEASE keep seeding this so I can finish it, and fly this link around for the petition to everyone you know. Fuck Mtv putting out run's house and the fucking hills on DVD, but dropping this project just before it was due to release! "
,serifhim,2008-08-28T23:52Z,Nobody currently seeding has the whole thing. It's stalled at 98%. Broken torrent? You decide.
,InBleedingRapture,2009-05-04T04:37Z,"This is the first torrent for The State I've come across and I've literally been looking for years. Hilarious! Classic 90s. 

This one's staying on my seed list indefinitely. My cable connection caps out at around 50 kb/s on the upload. Still, it's up there for any and all to grab.

Great stuff! Thanks a ton, Colt69!"
