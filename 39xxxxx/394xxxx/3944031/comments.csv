,Marklar44,2008-01-03T17:57Z,"how the hell did this leak!? they haven't even announced any information about it. Thanks anyways, can't wait to buy it.  "
,med088,2008-01-20T08:13Z,"Wikipedia lists a 12th track... ""Kiss My Irish Ass (Reprise)""... What's that all about?"

,sandwichmonster,2008-01-28T03:20Z,"Thanks for the upload, can't wait to see Flogging Molly live!"
,kilgoresparrot,2008-02-03T19:04Z,"flogging molly is one of the best live bands ive ever seen.
listening to live cuts gives me the chills just from the memory."
,gse7en,2008-02-16T22:36Z,"Cheers, brilliant album even though there's too much Green Day influence obviously about in the opening song.   The Green 17 Tour 2008 featured them playing almost all of the tracks from this CD, release date schedule for 04 March 2008.

One more thing.  That story titled ""New Flogging Molly Enjoy Bitches!"" is probably the dumbest thing I've ever read."
