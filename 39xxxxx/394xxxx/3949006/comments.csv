,farfetchd,2012-04-02T07:32Z,"Thanks, man. Question, since you included ""TV TV"" and ""Jupiter Room [Planetary Lobby Version]"" at 256kbps. Where were you able to find those at that quality, and do you know where to find the other bonus tracks at that same quality or higher? Or if anyone else knows? I've been surfing around, and am having a hard time locating them. Any help much appreciated."
