Our Daughter's Wedding was a quirky, synth-disco/new wave trio from New York consisting of Layne Rico on Synth, Keith Silva on vocals and keyboards, and Scott Simon on bass-synth and saxophone. The group allegedly took their name from a section of greeting cards. In 1981 they released the moderately successful " Lawnchairs". They released the 'Digital Cowboy' EP on EMI in [[1981]. The EP was recorded at Chipping Norton Studios in England (with notes "no sequencers used"), and it featured "Target for Life", that was a surprisingly good song, a pure new wave at its best, and can be easily compared with some of the hits of the more famous Talk Talk that came later.

After the 'Digital Cowboy', the band released a regular LP-album in 1982 - 'Moving Windows'. The music was closer to the sound of OMD and Gary Numan, and featured singles "Auto Music" and "Elevate Her", but the album didn't meet the success of the 'Digital Cowboy' EP. Soon after it, the band broke up.
