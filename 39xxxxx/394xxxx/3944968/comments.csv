I have the EP mentioned here.
looking forward to hearing the other songs from the same time period."
,triton12,2008-03-06T03:31Z,"I'd like to add that one of the reasons the EP
stood out, in my opinion,  was the energetic drumming of SIMON PHILLIPS ! ! !
It's amazing the number of diverse recordings he 
has to his name, and yet, not nearly given the accolades that he deserves ! ! ! !"

Also the single version  ""Lawnchairs "" is different than on the LP. I saw them over a dozen times and my 2 fave songs by them never made it to record/cd      ...oh well"
