,JonnyDr,2008-01-03T20:10Z,"Well, upon ABXing i have to say that I prefer the CD version, but it's a top rip nevertheless, and thanks again!"
,_Nutshell_,2008-01-10T19:31Z,"1.17GB?? That's huuuge for one album, although it IS the best album of all time, so it's easily worth it. =)"
,JonnyDr,2008-01-11T17:51Z,"Well if you're not fussed about 24bit/96K quality, then go for a normal lossless version."
,Latev,2008-01-20T12:11Z,"Ow, thanks :)"
,theshape31,2008-03-23T04:53Z,Wow.  This is the best sounding digital music I've heard away from DVD-Audio.  Kill the CD.
,ludacris016,2008-03-25T15:58Z,"Thanks alot, love the quality :-)"
,egoretop,2008-03-29T16:27Z,Cool stuff!!! Tnx!

,rheymasterio,2009-03-17T18:05Z,"all i hear is static....

i got a sound blaster 24bit with logitech x540"
,rheymasterio,2009-03-17T18:13Z,"i take it back, i used coreflac"
,greenhorn26,2009-04-19T18:25Z,"i'm a noob to the whole FLAC. How come iTunes can't play this file right. I am using 'Fluke' to have my FLAC files play in itunes. So far no issues. However when I play this file in iTunes, it's slowed down. I know it' not the file since I can play it perfectly in VLC player. Just a wondering. Does it have to do with the 24bit?

Phenomenal upload. Best digital rip i've heard. Thanks "
,bbutton1,2009-08-12T23:12Z,"well... this is my first album thats rip from vinyl...

must say, 100MB per song... pff it must sound awesome :)"
,Zeppoleon,2009-12-14T05:00Z,This looks enticing! 
,admiralmotlagh,2010-02-26T23:10Z,"beautiful sound, much thanks! any idea how to put this on itunes? fluke doesn't seem to take the 24bit properly

(same problem as greenhorn, really)"
,admiralmotlagh,2010-02-26T23:14Z,"also, if you browse the uploader's files, you'll find a similar quality version of the bends, though it'll not come up under any search of, say, 'radiohead flac' -- thanks again!"
,muzikphan,2010-03-01T17:02Z,"Thanks a lot candy.

Now for those of you wanting to play these awesome files on iTunes, just forget it! 
iTunes can't and won't handle flacs in 24/96.

If you're on a Mac I recommend ""Play"" from sboothDOTorg. Its playback quality makes iTunes suck big time. The only drawback is the lack of artwork support which is coming on the next release sometime soon.
This is my favorite audio player of all.

On Windows you should use the killer ""foobar2000"".
It's one awesome player, once installed properly.

The other option that is cross platform would be ""Songbird"", which is a bit bloated and slugish on older computers, but does the job well mostly.

My 2 cents.

Peace!"
,wopwopwop,2010-08-02T09:06Z,MASSIVE thanks!
,manzilla,2012-04-01T02:30Z,"thanks candyflip and thanks for all your comment muzikphan, play is indeed fantastic"
