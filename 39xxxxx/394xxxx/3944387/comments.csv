,datora,2011-01-11T01:42Z,"WOW!!  THANK YOU!!  Wonderful collection, great band.  For anyone interested, the FLCL (fooly cooly) anime OST 1, 2, & 3 CDs are available in *.flac at bakabt.com (a place where you really want to go if you're into anime ... trust me!).

If anyone wants to put the rest of these CDs up in *.flac, I'll be a loyal seeder (as I am on this torrent ... until better comes along. ;-) )"
