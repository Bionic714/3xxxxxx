As far as I am aware, this track is due to be released under Angello & Ingrosso's alias 'Buy Now', which is actually one of several aliases they have previously released under.


Of course, I am also keeping a keen eye out for their other forthcoming title, "Body Crash".



Enjoy and please seed.
