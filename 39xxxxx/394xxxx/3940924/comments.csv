,Labwrath,2007-12-20T07:19Z,"""Has the human race finally evolved to a higher reality?"" Yeah right, this is why we are still in an auto-destruction phase and that most humans are always looking to be better than others without thinking of the well-being of the less fortunate. Technology is progressing but we are still as dumb as we were a 100 years ago. The end of the human race won't mean the end of the world. The earth will be there long after we are extinct. The way we act, I guess it won't be that long, maybe 100 -200 years max (I'm being generous, my guess is more 50-100 years before hell hits us in the face). "
,FooSnik,2007-12-22T03:46Z,"I agree.  Evolution will always win against the forces of entropy, even if that means destabilizing, breaking up and wiping out our society which seems to be largely an entropic force.  If they flow with evolution and grow along with it then they will be fine.  If they fight against evolution and hold on to their selfishness then they will wipe themselves out.  But there will be some people left to reorganize things in a higher order.  I bet against us becoming totally extinct."
,duhprane,2007-12-22T17:04Z,"I think all we need to do is hang a few neocons in the US, Britain, France and Australia from the light posts outside their offices, and things will start looking up all 'round. 

The war makers can ignore the people and their silly little peaceful protests forever. What the world needs is some new found mob gusto.

Kill a few of the super wealthy in a furious mob action, and things will start to change, and only a tiny few will have to suffer."
,Broncojoe,2008-05-09T09:31Z,"I know about the ""Indigo's. I have children that are. The concept is propaganda, so that certain prodigal children may be more easily located. Why, because they plan to take them away in the next few years. I do not at all like these super-wealthy, keeping tabs on my kids, and even offering to send them to Berckley."
,Broncojoe,2008-05-09T09:35Z,"Seriously, if you fall for this ""New Age"" spiritual enlightenment Hippie shit, then you are living in LaLa land. The plan is to remove the kids from harms way, while they kill the rest of us off. "
,SeGo4th,2008-08-30T00:46Z,"That is the plan. The only way to make things better. Whether we become extinct or not is not the issue. Humans will run their course eventually, but why let us self destruct to the end? Our children are born in peace. If you spread the awareness of that fact, create acceptance in an assuming world, they might be able to stay in peace. But... I suppose that's too much to ask."
,kpkt22,2010-04-13T15:09Z,"I'm one of these so called 'indigo's' of whom has a multi-dimensional insight into the world and beyond. The proof is not in me stating so, but the evidence of people's reactions throughout Life. The point of all this 'knowledge plagarism' is for the lesser developed people (that presume to have a controlling position in other people's lives, british poms are a fantastic example) to assiduate some stupid 'official position'.
Both my parents are from Berkeley campus and the govt. prevents me from knowing their true identity. Whatever. I know who I am and the Truth outlives any pom'ish opinion. Not all of us (speaking for myself) have beneficent lives, at all. I have come across others in my 50 years, but long term relations are amiss.
I have developed technological projects that do not exist in the world and would help society only to be brushed away, usually by presumptive dust bag idiots like those that make up the masonic 'order'. These ptilian chimps are strangling most everything today so they can have their luciferian world odor.
BOT - To my understanding, I can only see that we have more of the beneficial genes in our chromosomes switched on. This is available to everyone, but in the game of chance in Life there are always variations.
Truly, the qualities that 'we' enjoy (but not so much to the patience of others) can be switched on through a varitety of means. Similar to managing a proper diet in switching off the cancer gene. Proven fact.
A reminder that of the 70,000 genetic codes that are in a regular persons body, only about 30% of the beneficial ones are turned on.
Here's an insight folks, for example: the DNA structure that most people are familiar with is merely the skeleton structure of a more complex system.
Darwin, bite off."

We have Mary Rodwell at our event -  Leeds, UK august 2010.

,BlueShadowGirl,2011-12-13T04:46Z,"I believe I'm also a Indico person (at least I believe I'm one),  my understanding of complex technologies goes beyond the average brain capability especially for my home town when is very remote, with in years of self learning my awareness capability  goes not just to this plane in this dimension but to others very distant from this one.  I believe the lack comprehension for the environment and deep root of socialization will Not allow normal mental standards to fully process and understand a New Era.  This, in order to remove 'the illusion'' from their conciseness.  It will take them years to understand a concept that we just born within.... But!! is nobodies Fault, the lack of information and social system control is most likely the case.   Wake up in the morning to go to a job, war, monetary system, monopolies, brands, perfect family in the eternal A-dream and social standards, even good and evil, time and space is just a concept that we invent ....is just relative.... and is not the true main Purpose of existence, we just Forgot it, simply like that... we just decay every day in a Devolution state that won't last long.    Our job as a Light Beings is to promote and provoke the awareness in others for the sake of evolution and to remember who we really are.   kpkt22 Your awesome by the way! ;)  ... "
