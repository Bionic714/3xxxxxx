,corthew,2008-02-04T13:19Z,"I am having trouble playing this AVI. Do you know the specs for the recording?
Audio/video codecs used, etc?
It plays but the video plays much slower than the audio and the audio doesn't play as fast as it should.
I noticed that its big for an AVI of a normal length movie so I'm guessing you are using some old encoders.
Any help is appreciated. I saw this movie back in the early 90's and when 9/11 happened the first thing I thought of was the two missiles striking New York city, sent by a middle eastern follower of Mohamadan law.
I want my son to see this movie but its impossible at present.

Thanks"

,jengkoil,2008-09-17T19:14Z,"this copy is crap, video played too slow and the audio missing from second quarter to the end"
,MadCecil,2008-12-19T23:09Z,"The file is fine BUT when I tried playing it on severel players I had bad results.  When I used ConvertDVD and made a DVD out of it, it worked fine.  The codec is some sort of mpeg4 but doesn't really work with quicktime either.  My DVD plays great."
,sram959,2009-12-14T06:50Z,This video doesn't work properly. Sound stops in a few minutes. the video quality is poor. This is a useless download.
,Otomachi,2010-02-08T03:44Z,"Video is fine, the audio codec is a bit difficult to get working right, I had to convert it to stereo because its identified as A52 (dolby digital) or codec2000, either of those something make it run wobbly and faster that really it is recorded."
,Menthenow,2010-02-23T04:22Z,"the video and sound are getting hit to first run.
wtf"
