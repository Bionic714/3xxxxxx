Release Notes:

Lucky, the title of Nada Surf?s fifth album, is at
once literal and ironic. Like the songs that
singer-guitarist Matthew Caws, bassist Daniel Lorca
and drummer Ira Elliot crafted for their previous
two albums, let go (2003) and the weight is a gift
(2005), lucky is filled with images of
restlessness, longing and the elusiveness of love.
Yet the band counterbalances the lyrical
bittersweetness with a musical buoyancy. Intimate
songs become in-it-together anthems, thanks to the
chiming guitars, propulsive rhythms, and the
emotional candor in Caws' vocals. A song like
beautiful beat segues from a sparsely arranged,
confessional first verse into a harmony-laden
chorus and reaches multi-layered, canon-like
proportions before the track fades out. If Caws is
often suggesting that romance and resolution may
still be an inch or two out of reach, he's also
proffering immediate musical solace. Turn up the
volume, hit the repeat button, and your troubles,
for a blissful three minutes or so, will disappear.

It has been recorded throughout March and August
2007 at the Robert Lang Studios, in Seattle, under
the direction of producer John Goodmanson.

The band issued an official statement announcing
this album on October 12, 2007. The song "See These
Bones" premiered on the Anti-Hit List Podcast on
October 20, 2007.[1] Due to a misquotation of
Matthew Caws, it was first expected to be called
Time for Plan A.
