IRIS Flight Simulation Software brings you our latest aircraft, the Royal Air Force & Royal Navy F-4 Phantom FG.1. 

The Phantom continues our range of quality products from IRIS and is fully compatible with both Microsoft Flight Simulator X and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight. 

Thanks to our lead product researcher Steve Holland, who was a member of 56 Squadron during the reign of the almighty ?Toom?, our Phantom features enhanced XML coding within the aircraft models to accurately replicate the inner workings of the aircraft. Items of note are working auxillery intake doors on the upper and lower fuselage, pilots that disappear when the engines shut down, plus intake covers and other ancillary items that appear when you shut down the aircraft. 

For the Royal Navy Phantom, we have modeled the aircraft to angle correctly when engaging the extendable nose leg prior to carrier launch. plus displaying the launch shuttle and harness wires for launching! 

We have taken on board comments from FGR.2 customers and improved the virtual cockpit by increasing the resolution of the side consoles. Gone are the old FS98 coded gauges, we have created a whole new suite of gauges in XML format for higher resolution in 2D and VC views. 

Other features include working switches, radios, levers and other effects and silky smooth gauge refresh rates on most systems. Also included is a 2D panel which comes with a VFR view for flying fast down low, and an IFR panel popup with enlarged instruments for ease of use when navigating from place to place! Tour the world with the IRIS Phantom! 

The exterior model has also retained our trademarked quality which has been built from a our established range of aircraft, and the product features a number of different models as has come to be expected from IRIS, including for the FIRST time in Flight Simulator, the EMI reconnaissance pod carried by the RAF Phantom FGR.2 in Germany during the Cold War! 

We have also once again had the privilege to employ the sound genius of Christoffer Petersen who has provided us with some excellent sounds for the Phantom recorded from the real deal which I am sure will have you playing with that volume control! 

And for those of you with the latest version of Microsoft Flight Simulator, FSX, we have optimised and adjusted Chris' excellent soundset for the Phantom to fine form in FSX featuring full 360 degree sound panning! Now hear the roar of the engines from the rear of the aircraft and the turbine jet whine from the front. Those tower flybys will NEVER be the same again! 

Our resident artists have provided you with some new paintschemes of the FG.1 and FGR.2 during its service, from the well known to the unique ones not seen regularly including the famous 'Black Mike' of 111 Squadron.
