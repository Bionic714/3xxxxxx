People, don't download NAB from torrent.
It doesnt work, & its very slow.

There are 3 ways from this site to 100% download the game. Use the 3rd option.

Good Luck !"

,TheFirebird,2011-08-20T05:10Z,"!VIRUS DETECTED!

Sorry to say this, because it's the only torrent of this game, but it contains a Virus. MSE detected it while installing the game. It removed the Virus, and now i can still play this game, but i think there will be some crashes."
