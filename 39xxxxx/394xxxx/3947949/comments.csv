,mike18xx,2007-12-28T10:53Z,"Let me get this straight: It's from a DVD9, the encode is ""untouched"", and yet it's 4.43gb?

Something ain't adding up....."
,Shotor,2008-01-02T07:13Z,"I will download this and post back if it's a faker or real. Personally I prefer to download the VOB file torrents and not compressed as it is prone to CRC code errors and such.    

P.S. This movie is about 90 minutes and has minor extras and the Full screen version is stripped.  So I think it could be untouched.  However when you'd see Pirates or Transformers or SpiderMan3 in a 4.7 size and says untouched, then you know something's up. "
