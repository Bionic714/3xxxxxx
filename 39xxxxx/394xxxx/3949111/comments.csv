,Brad3514,2007-12-27T01:27Z,umm Whats a Mighty Boosh? lol
,gqgqgq,2007-12-27T01:29Z,I'll seed until I see 5 peers.
,gqgqgq,2007-12-29T04:55Z,...err...seeders.
,sebastiane69,2007-12-30T14:38Z,"Please seed - stuck at 32% :(

Thanks"
,natabus,2008-01-04T19:47Z,"Download speed was great at first... now stuck on ~54% because of no seeds available.

I'll seed to at least 500% ratio if someone could get more seeds up for a bit."
,goho,2008-01-05T17:44Z,Seed please!
,gqgqgq,2008-01-05T22:23Z,"comp has been on and off sorry, i will keep seeding, hang in there..."
,LazyD,2008-01-12T13:47Z,"2 questions to the uploader:

1) NTSC, how come? I know you were pretty quick to post this after the 3rd series ended but did this come out on ntsc in the us before pal in uk or something? Or are these dvd video you made yourself from recordings off tv?

2) Over 15 days and still no dice, any chance of actually finishing this and letting us all upload? Is it not uploading properly or something?

Thanks in advance for if it ever finishes."
,wildmandingo,2008-01-17T07:16Z,Please seed! I'm stuck at 85%. If my download ever finishes I will seed this for a month!
,gqgqgq,2008-01-18T04:32Z,"Answers: This was made from good BBC episodes I grabbed online., you'll see intros and the BBC logo for some. I worked up a quick menu for all 3 seasons. Seasons 2 and 3 have only 6 episodes each. 

Be patient. I will finish the seed."
,louiseday,2008-01-20T07:13Z,"Hi, I'm stuck at a very frustrating 93.8% PLEASE SEED!! I""ve been waiting for almost 48hours and I'm getting desperate!! I promise to seed it forever - Thanks!!"
,LazyD,2008-01-20T16:31Z,"Almost 48 hours, you lucky so and so.

I've been waiting 23 days.

gqgqgq: I don't really care about the quality and bbc stuff aslong as it watchable, I'm just wondering why you encoded it in ntsc?

Have you got it on super seed mode? Seriously, how come it's taking this long? I don't mean to complain, I remember the days when I was on 24% for almost a week, at least I'm on 94.1% now. Maybe your pc needs a couple more hamsters?"
,gqgqgq,2008-01-21T22:35Z,"This was a lot of work to put together, its also 13Gigs. I'm trying to seed best I can, but until you all have it, its just me. Did I mention the part about 13 gigs? I get about an avg 20K upload. Sorry but thats as good as it gets. You want I should stop at .99? Just be patient."
,natabus,2008-01-24T23:03Z,"Hey there.

I finally managed to get a complete Copy, and to date have seeded it back at about 500%

 However, I notice a play quality issue. It may be me.

 If I view the VOB files with Windows Media player, everything is fine (it correctly interprets the DVD menus and such)

 However, when I burn and then view the DVD with software specifically for DVD playback (PowerDVD) The menus work fine, but the actual playback is unwatchable from rectangular video artifacts. This was not a burning problem,as I have tried multiples. Nor is it, I think, a Download problem, because it is consistent with both season 1 and 2.

 Ideas?"
,louiseday,2008-01-29T22:49Z,Well it took over a week - but it was well worth the wait! Great quality and no probs at all. Thanks everyone!
,fanaticus,2008-03-09T21:48Z,Is episode six the last in the season? Is any other episodes out?
,richard0474,2008-04-29T14:18Z,"Perfect playback and pretty good quality.

Thanks!"
,Ltp0wer,2008-06-23T11:06Z,"Great torrent, Great Quality, Great Show."
,sciubba,2008-07-17T06:53Z,SEeed it!!!!!
,mnkyseemnkydoo,2008-09-07T20:10Z,"ok say wow.
I started this on July 25th,
It's on 98% on Sept 7...
I am so hoping this is worth it... It's the Boosh so it should be."
,olip74,2008-10-07T12:45Z,gggggg thanks a million for this - must have taken you a wee while but well worth the effort and much appreciated!
,radicalblast,2009-02-11T00:33Z,"hey ive already got season 1 but ill download this for the rest of them anywayz :P..

just wondering, could someone tell me which season has Old Gregg in it ?? xD

""Im the Moon, I dont pay for Dental Fees"" :L :D"
,Djsanz,2009-02-15T12:22Z,"The first series is a dvdrip and the the second and third are tv ones that have been prepared as VOB files for dvd burning. Why, prepare the files to be burnt then tell people to buy it? lol. If i was gonna buy it and download beforehand, i'd rather have avi. that takes less space up. It only takes a fraction of the time to use convertX. Anyway, in a nutshell its a british comedy series in which there was 3 made and yes they are funny, i think so anyway."
,Djsanz,2009-02-15T12:25Z,radicalblast - season 2 episode 5 is old gregg one.
,Djsanz,2009-02-15T12:28Z,"What pisses me off is, i deleted this lot on avi, to download this thinking they would be all rips, yeah i've been waiting weeks for download too, although i've been stopping and starting it to help others download. It's on 99% now and keeps saying there's a disk error??????"
,gqgqgq,2009-03-09T04:34Z,"From the UPLOADER:

I did this before it was out on DVD for us poor saps in the U.S, figured I'd bundle it up as VOBs for burning because a lot of people have grief doing the conversions then spam the comments complaining about the files. I was just trying to make it easy. For the record, and if you can read, these grabs are all from T.V, not DVDRIPS, so don't get your hopes up."
,Greensward_Grey,2009-03-14T06:52Z,"Question, would this work on an iPod?"
,VincentB,2009-04-21T14:37Z,"1. Being NTSC, will this work on a DVD player in Australia if I just burn it?
2. Are these the full DVDs, including the main menu and special features etc.?"
,XBCassidyX,2009-08-22T08:29Z,"Gr8 torrent, no problems. Thanks!"
[T],joskewarez,2009-12-29T13:47Z,"bad bad torrent!
these are self-made dvd's
-> low quality, bad compression"
,-ZEEBEE-,2010-03-03T17:19Z,THANKYOU
