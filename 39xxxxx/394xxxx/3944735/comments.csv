""Unable to load ""(digimob) Student of the Occult Mega-...torrent"": invalid path in torrent!"" 

I have tried everything, googled everything about it, but I just can't figure out how to load this torrent up to my queue, if someone has any idea what I can do please let me know!

Thanks, and great torrents!!!"
