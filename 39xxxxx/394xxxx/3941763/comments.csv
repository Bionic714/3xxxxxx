I am going close my other uploads, and seed this as much as i can!"
,KrabatenX,2008-05-04T22:07Z,okay any viruses?... Whats in the .rar files?
,jameswsparker,2008-08-19T22:08Z,"This is defintely a torrent worth downloading, great videos and good quality. All the videos are in DivX format, and so therefore require DivX to play, or DivX-Avi Compatiable software, e.g. possibly Windows Media Player.

Thanks for uploading."
,sdrhacker,2009-01-19T17:15Z,"Just took a look at my old torrent. I can see your right hiras, the file is only 22,7 mb. I am not sure what went wrong, but unfortunately i haven't got the files anymore. So i am sorry, I can't do anything about it :S

If it makes you feel better, google video has got a low res video of it at: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7933034886088114758&ei=raZ0SYGxNZaWiQKE35TsCg&q=Cracked+Productions+Episode+2"
,SalemdelaPoer,2009-06-01T00:24Z,I've been off-line for over a year. These guys get busted? I can't find their site.
,sdrhacker,2009-06-17T21:59Z,"Don't even have my own torrent anymore. Nice to know that people still are seeding it :D

And yea, they stopped making these movie for some dumb reason i think :S "
