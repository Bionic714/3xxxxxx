This is the second episode that Cracked has made. Itâ??s main goal, or topic, is completely focused around gamez. Itâ??s a bit different then you would normally think when you hear the word â??gamezâ??. Instead of being about playing gamez, itâ??s about hacking/modding game consoles. It has some very simple hacks/mods in it such as the fan mod to the GameCube, or the GameBoy game players for the GameCube or the Super Nintendo. But then, it delves into some deeper, more complicated tasks. Such as modding the Playstation 2 and GameCube case so that both can play burned back up games while gaining a wickedly awesome outer appearance. For more information . . . DOWNLOAD THE VIDEO!
