,mirrorspocks,2008-04-02T04:02Z,"At first I thought, ""No Kirk?!, A travesty!!"". But Boon is right, it was a bad tie-in and definitely not a worthy ending for the Great Kirk. Although as an older guy not up on all the tech, I have a ton of respect for the original uploaders of all the media here. But the fanedit guys blow me away! Obviously a lot of care, respect, hell, even love go into what is essentially making a new movie. Bear with an old dude,I would like to download via rapidshare. How? Once again, Kudos to the faneditors!"
,valerieG,2008-10-02T19:33Z,"Thanks for interesting fan-edit & good a/v quality. I will always seed this one when I am online, so anybody trying to get it, just be patient. I have had problems getting menu to work in dvd player after burning to disc, but that is probably my fault, since it plays in comp dvd fine. "
,csijoe,2008-11-10T10:38Z,figures when I finally find out about this there's no seeders online.  Hopefully some will show up soon :)

die to all fan edit releases. people who do that clearly don't know what a good movie is all about. god damn all 'hollywood director wannabes'!!"
,SCLEMTAK,2009-04-19T00:18Z,"I can see where you are coming from with this fan-edit.But this movie is now pointless.The film is called GENERATIONS for a reason,KIRK Being that reason.generation gap merging both old and new captains together to battle a common enemy from two timelines.It`s rather like making ""STAR TREK 3 THE SEARCH FOR NOTHING"" Just because someone thought that Spock ruined it.I do agree that Kirks death was not fitting for a captain of his kalibre and reputation.but taking Kirk out of this movie is like removing the warp core out of the Enterprise.The whole thing goes nowhere..Nicely done mind you.but ""OH MY!!"""
