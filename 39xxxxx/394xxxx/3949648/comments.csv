Because the Animal Liberation Front, despite its name and claims, is little more than a terrorist group.
They ""liberate"" pets from loving, doting owners. They've assaulted people wearing FAKE leather, feathers and fur.

They're a psychotically fanatic, misguided group who believes in using threats, violence and destruction instead of using the legal system to force better humane-treatment laws.
They also associate heavily with PeTA, the organization that prefers to kill healthy, adoptable pets instead of finding them homes.

I'll snag this with the hopes that it actually shows how corrupt ALF is in comparison to REAL animal-rights groups."
,b5200,2010-02-23T20:33Z,"The ALF is not violent.  There is no formal structure the ALF.  An ALF action is one that does not cause harm to human or non-human animals.  Because you are only a member of the ALF if you are nonviolent.  I have never heard of the ALF taking animals from pet owners, only from exceedingly cruel animal testing laboratories, fur farms,  and other places of animal suffering.  Please cite the claim by of someone doing this in the name of the ALF.

Once again there is no formal organization so there is no way for them to ""associate"" with PETA, and a large number of ALF activists despise PETA.  

There is no leadership in ALF (idiots never can seem to grasp the concept of leaderless resistance) so it can't be corrupt.

I would actually bet you're working for the FBI or some animal testing laboratory trying to turn public opinion against the ALF.  Because if you would actually watch the damn documentary I think your opinion would change.

There is a violent group that believes in using violence to further animal rights, and they are called the Animal Rights Militia.  They are not the Animal Liberation Front."

,nicofiend,2012-02-24T07:28Z,"omg alf is totally a terrorist organization.

claiming that h1vem1nd is working for the FBI to dissuade the public against supporting alf makes no sense (because tpb comments are really hotspots for public opinion, right?)

anyway, i'm going to go rape some baby seals for sport. hope you die in a fire along with the rest of the bleeding heart sycophants comprising your little club"
