Mainstream media has been trying to ridicule the animal/eco movement for such a long time this DVD clearly shows that what Animal Liberation does is so very important. As long as there is major fault in the system we live in that thinks its ok to harm other living creatures, animal liberation front will need all help they can get to oppose this sick disease this animal industry truly is."
