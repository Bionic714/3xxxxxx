A short description of the film:

Plot Synopsis	by Dan Pavlides

\\\\\\\"A former soldier is branded an idiot because of his epileptic seizures caused by wartime experiences. He shows unbridled compassion for people after he moves in with friends of his family as he tries to help a young man ruined by the war and a woman hounded by a wealthy but cruel suitor. All the characters are victims of the war and its devastating emotional aftershocks. Taken from Feodor Dostoyevsky\\\\\\\'s classic novel, the screenplay was written by the film\\\\\\\'s director, Akira Kurosawa.\\\\\\\"

Author: KFL from Bloomington, IN

\\\\\\\"The original _Idiot_ by Dostoyevsky is already a work that demands quite a lot of patience and suspension of disbelief. It has always relied implicitly on the rather obvious Christ metaphor: Myshkin (in this movie, Kameda) is too pure, too selfless to exist in a world as cruel as ours--he is fated to a martyr\\\\\\\'s end.

The failings of the novel are noted with much caustic humor by Vladimir Nabokov in his _Notes on Russian Literature_. Suffice it to say, the original novel strains credulity.

But this situation is exacerbated considerably by bringing the story to Japan. There is really little reason for several main characters here to come to regard Kameda as a saint-like figure. Japanese culture lacks the appropriate religious underpinnings, and the several extreme displays of emotion are far outside the norm in Japanese society.

This was already a fragile flower, so to speak, in its native Russia; in this foreign soil it never really had a chance.

There are some compelling scenes, but they are too far and too few between, IMHO. Perhaps worth watching once if you are a fan of the novel; otherwise I\\\\\\\'d give it a pass.\\\\\\\"
