,merlinakos,2007-12-31T22:45Z,Hi. Is there any way to store the auto drive hellas .img directly in SD  ? ( Garmin MapSource Greece (Auto Drive Hellas v1.20) created from SD card image )
,FatFreddy2,2008-01-01T23:50Z,"merlinakos:
Download the installer directly from manufacturer:
http://autodrivehellas.gr/Auto_Drive_Hellas_v1.25_en.exe
It _only_ supports direct copy to SD cards."
,FatFreddy2,2008-01-01T23:51Z,"Forgot to comment, that the Find function is not working with this (yet), but at least you can see this map not only on your GPS, but also in MapSource."
