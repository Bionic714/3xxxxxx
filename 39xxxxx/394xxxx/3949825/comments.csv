,coronado8,2008-03-10T06:50Z,"Installed and applied the patch to no avail (in different order, later even attempted 3d-party ""no cd"" patches), it is still asking for a cd. Has anybody managed to really go farther? 

And the patch itself seems to be an official 1.1c->1d1d upgrade without any additional magic .."
