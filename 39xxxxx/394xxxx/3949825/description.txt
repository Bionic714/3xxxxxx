Old Flight Sim.
Apache Havoc provides an accurate simulation of both helicopters including realistic flight dynamics, authentic weapons systems and detailed cockpits, displays and instruments. 
There are three huge, real world combat zones, accurately modelled from digital data. The terrain is rugged and covered in dense forest canopy, making 'line of sight' tactics a real part of the game play. The forest is penetrated by roads, rivers and electricity pylons creating a landscape ideally suited to low-level helicopter combat.
Apache Havoc features in excess of 50 different vehicles.
