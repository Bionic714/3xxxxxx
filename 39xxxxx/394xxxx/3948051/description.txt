The only existing video with Eva Cassidy. Unfortunately the DVD is not avaliable anymore - so I will share this .avi:

What a wonderful world
cheek to cheek
people get ready
you've changed
time after time
honeysuckle rose
autumn leaves
stormy monday
tall trees in georgia
over the rainbow	

So sad she is not with us anymore - she made such beautiful music. R.I.P. Eva.

My upload is crap - so please help seed!
