Its not like Im a major uploader that the cops are watching and a gunna bust for recording a concert. lol. I doubt anybody will, but if you just want to say thanks, or hi please do check out my bebo page.

This took me many many hours to enhance, so please seed when you are done so others can enjoy :)"
,meow_cat,2007-12-23T10:29Z,"I would just like to say I was at this very concert, front row for the whole night! Was the best fucken night of my life!"
,meow_cat,2007-12-24T01:06Z,"IF NOBODY IS GOING TO SEED IM GOING TO STOP ASWELL AND NOBODY WILL HAVE THE COMPLETED TORRENT!!! 

SEED WHEN YOU COMPLETE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

DONT BE A FUCKEN PATHETIC LEACHER!"
,meow_cat,2007-12-24T11:52Z,"Ok, im sick of you leachers! I do all this work and everybody is just hit and run.... nobody is going to be able to download this torrent fully because im not seeding anymore! ratio is at 23.576 and still im the only seeder!!!! 

If you are prepared to seed, leave a comment and I will re-seed to help you out... until then all you leachers can go to hell and be stuck with an incomplete torrent!"
,mortalli,2007-12-26T13:09Z,"You were seeding for 90 people, most of whom are still here, waiting to complete. When you're a sole seeder, you WILL upload way more than 1:1, especially with a torrent this popular. Re-up it--I think you'll be pleased with how long this stays seeded."
,meow_cat,2007-12-27T00:29Z,"I have seeded to 59.234 (9.76GB) and that with utorrent set to initial seeding aswell. This is the last time I am going to seed. If everybody keeps doing hit & runs I will not be uploading anymore torrents. I have plenty more concerts and other movies and tv programs and stuff to share, but i am not going to be doing it if everybody is hitting and running. SEED!!! "
,hexan07,2007-12-27T08:30Z,"There is around 20 of us all stuck on 98.8, give us a little and it will be seeded, a few of the other IPs look like NZ as well, so you will be doing it for the country"
,meow_cat,2007-12-31T12:02Z,"Does nobody even apreciate my work? maby I should just go back to private trackers?? hmmm. Ive uploaded 23GB so far for a 165mb file... I mean come on not a single seeder apart from me. thats pathetic. If anybody wants to get their torrent above 99.8%.... send me an email the_entertainment_zone@hotmail.com   Dont boither with my bebo, Ive change the URL"
,MonaroNZ,2008-06-21T08:48Z,"I have asked him to re-up it so I can help get this seeded!
