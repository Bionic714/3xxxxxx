 These are my own drivers made for me after hours and houer of web surfing searching these fucking shit drivers!!!

 Work for my pestilent "Soltech" (hear generic...?) 300k brand new fucking webcam.

                             All stuff working great!!!

Install notes:

 Just unrar in any dir what you want, plug de usb webcam and follow de steps of the appearing automatic (cif single chip..) plug & play window. When it ask for a driver just guide them to location of the unrared files. Finish the install and probe the new camera with the "AMCap.exe" program includded.

 Other way, if the automatic fails, is to go to "Add new hardware" in control panel and follow the same steps above.
