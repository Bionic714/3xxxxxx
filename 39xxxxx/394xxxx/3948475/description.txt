BBC 2 

By 1945 Vichy France had deported 76,000 Jews to Nazi concentration camps.

Told in their own words, these are the hair-raising stories of four children secretly
hidden by ordinary French people.

Today, they look like anyone's grandparents. But their stories are of narrow escapes,
incredible adventures, great heroism, and terrible loss.

Award-winning director Jonathan Hacker awakes powerful emotions as he accompanies these
survivors to the places where, 60 years ago, they played a deadly game of hide-and seek.
