,tomreedtoon,2007-12-24T23:12Z,"So, you decided to create this new ""7 is Heaven"" torrent, and completely abandoned your ""9 is Fine"" torrent which we've been hanging on for five days. Very well. I certainly HOPE that you will eventually seed this torrent completely, JiffyJif. Otherwise, forget the three ghosts; you'll be at a Festivus celebration, and the Airing of Grievances will go on for a long time...not to mention the Feats of Strength."
,JiffyJif,2007-12-25T15:05Z,"tomreedtoon, I have read all of your silly comments & even if you do not know (& it is not hard to figure out), all of this was based on an idea that came to fruition. All of it is (free) hard work, that never had to be here to begin with, & could be gone just as easily. Us releasers do not ask for anymore than a thank you. When I see comments such as yours (especially at this time of the rolling year), I think; what a smug, thankless little fool. It makes me want to delete the torrent &, except for all the others, I would. TPB has a policy against flaming, let alone your ridiculous idle threats. If I see another one, I will report it to a mod, & maybe YOU will be removed from TPB. Believe me, if I could prevent you alone from downloading the torrent, I would. Merry Xmas! "
,randomgeneric,2007-12-25T16:41Z,Won't touch this as I only want one movie out of that whole mess. Please increase the efficiency of your torrents by including SEPARATE files for ech part of the compilation...save the mega-RARs for the newsgroups! I think you'd find more people are able  to take advantage and enjoy  your hard work 
,JiffyJif,2007-12-25T17:19Z,"randomgeneric, while I do not agree that the compilation is a ""mess"", I can somewhat understand your frustration of not being able to get a single avi. However, if I had wanted to torrent each avi seperately, it would not be a, ""pak"". Also, including SEPARATE files for each part of the compilation was something considered but not done for various reasons.
Also: newsgroups do not interest me for various reasons. 

I hope to see more positive comments & seeders, from any that have opened the pak.

Merry Xmas!

,tomreedtoon,2008-01-01T12:37Z,"My complaints are legitimate. I admit to being frustrated and damned angry at the way this matter was handled. But you must admit you were very uncommunicative.

A suggestion for more positive comments; if you're going to abandon a torrent as you did the original one, you should post a comment in the torrent section to let people know what you're doing.

It might also help if you joined the forum so you could be contacted indirectly (without giving out your e-mail, in other words) so that when problems like this occur, we can try to keep it private instead of airing dirty laundry in public, as I was forced to do. I did not enjoy insulting you to get your attention, but what recourse is there when you aren't talking to any of us?

As it is, I completed the second torrent, and will reseed it to 2X as I try to do; currently up to 1.76. I believe in supporting leechers, and I hope you've learned something useful from all the negative comments you've gotten."
,JiffyJif,2008-01-01T15:17Z,"tomreedtoon, whatevever. U assumed too much from the start. As I said b4, there was a system crash at my end, therefore the seed stopped, & I could not communicate which was unfortunate. There were comments about the new torrent posted at the DSRG, my flavor of choice. Nobody did anything on purpose, as u assumed. And in the immortal words of Tony Randall (aka Felix Unger):
""When u assume, u make an ASS out of U & ME."" As far as learning from the FEW negative comments submitted, I did not learn what I already knew: That negative comments are positively made by negative people. Nobody ""forced"" u 2 do anything. Judge Judy would have a field day with someone like u. Nuff said.
Happy friggin New Year 2 u 2."
,finerthingsrfree,2008-03-05T11:41Z,"Thanx JiffyJif for this wonderful torrent. I love Charles Dickens! I never saw the 1913 & 1923 versions. 
Look forward to it! 
May all your Christmases be merry & white!!!"
,Hello-133,2008-09-25T14:34Z,Would anyone know where I could get the 1970 musical version (Albert Finney) only? Most of the others are shown on TV every year but the musical is played rarely. Thanks for any info. 
,scroogenut,2008-11-25T20:12Z,anyone able to seed the 1913 and 1923 version in Scrooge Pak Fix?  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3944477/Scrooge_Pak_Fix  Thanks and Merry Christmas!!h
,Lanham1967,2008-12-08T04:07Z,Thanks for this fabulous torrent. I downloaded this last year and loved it so much I'm downloading it again this year. Actually my backup hard drive with all of my Christmas files on it died. Of course I had deleted the files from my primary drive because I had them backed up. I suppose I needed a backup for my backup. Thanks again and Merry Christmas.
,docsapporo,2008-12-23T22:55Z,"I just finished downloading the SCROOGE PAK 2007 and clicked on the first .rar file. My Mac opens up Stuffit Expander and it asks me for the password. I type in the password from this torrest file page and it begins unstuffing it. Then it stops and ask me for ""Scrooge.Pak.2007.7isHeaven.JiffyJif.DSRG.part001.R00"" There is no file with that name in the Pak! What should I do? I'm at a loss!"
,docsapporo,2008-12-24T00:56Z,"OK, I got it expanded. I downloaded the UnrarX program for the Mac, typed in the password and everything expanded just fine! Hope you all have a Merry Xmas & a Happy New Year! ;-)"
,zombeatle,2008-12-24T23:15Z,I am trying to re-author this now - I have the 1923 Scrooge and 1926 Old Scrooge (a reissue of 1913 Scrooge). I hope to have it up and available by Christmas morning 2008. (I am not the original poster of this)
,zombeatle,2008-12-24T23:16Z,previous comment refers to SCROOGE PAK FIX
