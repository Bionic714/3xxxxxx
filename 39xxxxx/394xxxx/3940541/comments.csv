by doing this_ you do the same as if you pooped in comments.
thanks"
,WorldWthoutMoney,2008-01-02T16:20Z,A movie not worth wasting hours -though the theme of the movie is good - the movie itself is a waste of talent - Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman -are u kidding me -how can someone make such a sad movie with such an awesome cast. NOT WORTH WATCHING ofcourse in my view. Though the quality of video is really gud.

,galdau88,2008-01-07T18:50Z,"Thanks for this one FXG,great quality."
,Loopiie,2008-01-09T22:01Z,"Problem here! It says on VLC media player that the films runtime is 1.02.41, and it stops at 1.09.28. But here it says that the films runtime is 1.39.21, what the fuck??"
,trader08,2008-01-10T22:24Z,"Croise and Hadder just download convertxtodvd, and put it on dvd.  In my experience that program works with most video files."
,FuckCopyrights,2008-01-15T06:17Z,"This movie is a fucking turd.

And the ending... holy fucking shit. The mental midget wrote the script needs to be put to death immediately.

Watch Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) to see a superior product."
,Gixxermartin1,2008-01-17T14:37Z,Ja tyckte den var helt okej. Ingen wow faktor men sevärd är den. 
,sinoxo,2008-01-25T02:59Z,"omg... stuck at 98.5%. is it really so hard to seed? if everyone seeded for a week or two after they downloaded, we wouldn't have these problems. please seed..."
,Raulll87,2008-01-29T05:36Z,"Perfect quality, I love the large and wide screen! Thanks FXG!!"

,mrkinch78,2008-01-31T23:26Z,what is the oint in seeding you numbskulls if you limit the upload!?!  1983 seeders and downloading at 80kb/s  WTF?!?
,yura11,2008-02-02T21:37Z,thanks FXG great job great quality..keep it up
,xElixerx,2008-02-04T07:38Z,"@ all of the whiners above
limits are for the Bandwith! and besides 40 kbs isn't that bad, at least it's not a torrent you have to wait 2 weeks for!"
,xElixerx,2008-02-04T07:39Z,oh yeah and another reason is that it's free. so quit ur whining and have some over night patience. damn!
,ndoftaworld,2008-02-09T00:52Z,"For most residential users, capping the upload while downloading will greatly improve d/l speeds. Around 20k limit for a 5mg cable connection works pretty good. Just be sure to uncap and SEED after d/ling.  

And quit ur bitchin!!!"
,Hei_på-deg,2008-02-17T12:59Z,Generally you should cap your upload to about 80% of max. If that is too high you could try 70%.

,andretw6,2008-03-05T22:16Z,FXG Team 10/10 :D
,lawson_jl,2008-03-09T16:36Z,"First off thanks to the FXG-team! 

Second off to all the people bitching about the seeding. GO OUTISDE!  See the sun, interact with live flesh and blood people.  Get some ice cream.  Talk to a girl (or guy if your into that or are a girl).  Point is take some time to be human and have a life and when you com back from this brave new world your movie will be done and you can watch it.  Then while another one is downloading try going back outside again and you may make a friend, a real friend not just an internet friend.  And remember you bitching because people aren't helping you steal good enough!?!?"
,sam_49style,2008-03-09T19:34Z,It would really be great if anyone could help me...I dont know where to get a avi converter..to burn the dvds. (very new to all of this) thank you bunchs!
,jonny-boy-123,2008-03-13T19:21Z,very nice as per usual form fxg!! sam style look for a program called convertxtodvd!! its a brilliant little program will convert avi to dvd and will burn also!! hope this helps!!
,darorock,2008-03-16T11:45Z,"thanks fxg !!
is  funny  but quick time will  only play 5 seconds of the movie while  vlc  plays the movie  completely /..
great quality!!!!"
,Hider141,2008-03-16T17:50Z,"if you guys complain because of a speed of 40-80kbps, what should i say when i have most of the times only 20-25kbps and even 10kbps.so you shouldn't complain so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,rabba10,2008-03-17T09:03Z,"Sam49,
Try winavi, works pretty fast and does a decent job converting, burns it to dvd too."
,noobsmokindoobs,2008-03-19T03:20Z,I haven't downloaded this torrent - but I rented this the other day and it was GREAT.  Scifi or action buffs will dig it.
,mastershark02,2008-03-19T05:47Z,I'd like to ask all of you to please seed more. There are 19/97 ratio.....PLEASE SEED!!!!!!
,Timekiller666,2008-03-20T06:44Z,"Please seed buddies>>>>>>>
the speed is really very less"
,dan_man82,2008-03-25T23:13Z,"Very good quality as always...

but I seem to have problems when I convert it to dvd... the audio is way to fast (looks like hobbits speaking)...

probably my converting program :P

Overal quality vid/10 audio/10 (when not converted )"
,Mysticum81,2008-03-29T03:30Z,"dan_man: The audio in this rip is 48Khz, whereas a lot of media-related applications seem to think 44.1Khz is the max. This is usually the culprit when helium-like audio occurs.

You need to figure out how to get your DVD software (or sound card or whatever happens to be causing you trouble) to recognize 48Khz audio, and either play it back correctly, or convert it correctly.

Vague answer, I know, but the solution isn't as clear as the problem, which is almost certainly a sampling rate issue."
,clokverkorange,2008-04-06T20:23Z,"Played this back on my PS3. Seemed like the audio loses sync near the end of the movie, around the point Carol is trying to get onto the helicopter. Didn't ruin the movie, but it was slightly annoying as it was fine throughout the rest of the film."
,mukulakivi,2008-06-11T21:54Z,"Actually the movie having 48khz sound would probably sound wound down or pitched down on a dvd-player since they usually use 44.1 khz. But even then, since there are commercial DVD's with 48 khz most players should be able to play it.

I think the problem lies in the dvd-conversion that takes your 48khz and wounds it without resampling to 44.1 khz - hence the distortion or sound falling out of place. Check your converter for settings and look for resample in the audio section..."
,snblguy,2008-10-25T00:15Z,Great movie..

,justinlive,2009-07-16T04:58Z,Can more than 2 people seed please. I appreciate the ones who are but would like other people to seed also. Witch I think is respectful if you already downloaded it. Thank you.
,HD-Troll,2010-12-25T03:18Z,Out of sync - again.
,HD-Troll,2010-12-25T03:22Z,@clokverkorange: How strange. I played this on my PS3 and it was out of sync when they began to speak... I got a dozen movies of FXG but 3 of them are out of sync.
