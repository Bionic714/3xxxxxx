____________________________________________________________________

Insomniac is the fourth studio album from the punk rock band Green 
Day. It was released in 1995 on the Reprise Records label. Though 
it reached #2 in the U.S. and went double Platinum, Insomniac did 
not have the sales endurance of its predecessor, Dookie, largely due
 to its slightly darker lyrical tone and more abrasive sound. Though
 many consider Insomniac to be more consistent than Dookie, it did 
not feature a well-known hit single akin to "Longview" or "Basket 
Case" from Dookie or "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" from Nimrod.
 Before the name 'Insomniac', the band considered the naming the 
album 'Tight Wad Hill' (after the thirteenth track of the album).
