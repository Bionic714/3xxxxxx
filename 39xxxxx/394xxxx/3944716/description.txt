"Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family..."This is the story of Mark Renton and his so-called friends - a bunch of losers, liars, psychos, thieves and junkies. Hilarious but harrowing, the film charts the disintegration of their friendship as they proceed seemingly towards self-destruction. Mark alone has the insight and opportunity to escape his fate - but then again does he really want to "Choose life"?
