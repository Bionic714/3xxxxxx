Powered by multi-megawatt nuclear reactors, an air wing of 85 planes, and next-generation radar and combat capabilities, she has global strike capability. But before the Navy will deploy her to the Persian Gulf, she must prove her worth by winning a grueling, two-week exercise that pits two carrier battle groups - the USS Eisenhower and the USS Roosevelt - against each other. Its a massive war game that involves live ordnance and real bombs. Each carrier will be deployed with a full arsenal of fighter jets, destroyers, battleships, cruisers and submarines.
