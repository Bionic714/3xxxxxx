[FAN EDIT] SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT 2: MERRY F*CKIN' CHRISTMAS!

This version omits all of the flashback footage from part 1. Instead, we open with the emotional climax from the original and then continue "10 Years Later". Richard (Ricky) tells the "Doc" all about his girlfriend and his murderous rampage. When we come back to the institute, the "Doc" is dead, and Ricky has escaped. Ricky then searches for the evil Mother Superior in order to finally give her the "punishment" she so very much deserves.
