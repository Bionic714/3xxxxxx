,pandabat,2009-04-17T00:20Z,"Files sizes for season 3 look similar to other ""dinosaurs all seasons"" torrent in which season 3 quality is very poor. Other seasons are good though."

,froggyt,2010-09-25T22:51Z,"Not all of this is ripped from DVD. Season 3 is very low quality (noise, low res., bad color) and obviously from tape. Other than that, the others are good.    Season 4 has the best quality of all."
,ghostgg,2011-02-08T20:00Z,please seed stuck at 5%
