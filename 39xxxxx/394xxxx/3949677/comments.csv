,bearcy,2007-12-28T11:45Z,"I've just added this fix to the download of WaveLab 5.01b that I got from Demonoid. Since they were shut down, I thought it best to upload the whole program here as well."
,bearcy,2007-12-28T11:46Z,"Since I use it only for non-commercial use, I don't see any problems with using the cracked version of it. If ever I use it to make money, I have to pay the licence. Even I know that! I just try before buy! But even the people who own licences of the program, prefer to use the cracked version; because the copy protection is screwing up the program itself!"
,bearcy,2007-12-28T11:47Z,"WaveLab 5.01b is the best wave file editor I know. It is also the program I use to make all my MP3-pro files.

To edit the ID3-Tags of my MP3-pro files, I prefer using this fabolous freeware program instead:

,Danci92,2008-03-23T02:46Z,"When i start Wavelab it automaticly shuts down after like 1sec.

Når jeg starter wavelab lukker det seg etter 1 sekund.

Help?

Hjelp?

Thanks. Takker."
,UBERLADEN,2008-03-24T00:13Z,"Wow gratitudes to H2o yet again! 
app didNOT ask for ser # or web access???"
,bearcy,2008-04-04T12:53Z,"Like with Nero, this application uses a lot of time during setup. So just be patient; do not reboot, if it seems to be frozen or takes a long time to install. Just let it be, while you find something else to do, to pass your time; and you'll be fine!"
,saxo08,2008-06-14T15:17Z,"Still no progress. Had 5.01a which of course did not work with Vista. Downloaded this one and installed. Opened Wavelab, tried ""Open"" and the app crashed just as before. Realized that 5.01a was still around so I de-installed both, rebooted, reinstalled this fixed 5.01b version and did the same thing. Crash. Same for the ""Save"" option. Running the program as administrator and in the Win XP SP 2 compatibility mode. No difference. I can't see that this version really has the Vista fixes...? Anyone?"
,saxo08,2008-06-14T15:24Z,"Oh, just understood that even if the fixed version of the CommonVcPh.dll is in the package it must anyway be manually be replaced (comdlgxp.dll seems to be the same at least when looking at the timestamp/size data for the file). Now it worx. Hoooray! Tnxalot!"
,saxo08,2008-06-15T00:07Z,"Another thing that might occur as a problem with the combination of Wavelab 5 and Vista, but fortunately seems solvable, is that after the otherwise successful installation and first usage of Wavelab, it could not find any CD/DVD burner devices although other apps do. After some browsing I found the site www.frogaspi.org. Download the file from there, rename it according to instructions and copy to C:\Windows\System32 (you might not have had the WnAspi32.dll there earlier but perhaps in other locations, anyway it seems that it anyway should be in the System32 directory in order to make it work). Restart Wavelab and you might now see your CD/DVD device in the dropdown of the Write CD dialog."
,bearcy,2008-08-23T15:04Z,"Please be sure only to use this application from the profile you installed it. If you run it from another profile, it will implement restrictions, preventing you from using it further. So if you've installed it in one profile, and use another, please menu-click on the shortcut to the program, and select ""Run as..."" and then select the profile where you installed it. Then it will run without fail."
,DLL80,2008-09-09T22:54Z,"Hmmm i can't this working. Runnin Vista, install no problems, reboot ok, exchange the two files, click to start: ""The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000142)"". Re-installed 3 times, even got a separate ""vista fix"". 
Anyone please?"
,Fito33,2008-11-04T10:29Z,"DLL80 Maybe you need to tell the program to run with XP compatibility or some like that, Go to the program execution icon (Start, programs, wavelab start icon), right click on it, choose ""properties"" Compatibility and check the box for ""Run this program in comp, for windos xp sercice pack 2.

I hope this helps. Unfortunately there are some older appz that wont start easily with vista, another solution is to get a settings file from someone, I can try to do that too."
,bearcy,2008-12-15T23:48Z,"When installing under Windows Vista, please enter the folder ""WaveLab 5.01b for Windows Vista FIX"" and read the README.txt-file you find there. If you do exactly as it says, it will work under Vista:

Steinberg Wavelab 5.01b FIX for Windows VISTA

* Warning! Will only work with version 5.01b

Just copy the
comdlgxp.dll
and the
CommonVcPh.dll
to your Wavelab folder: Overwrite existing files!

In order for no problems to arise, you must also be sure to run WaveLab in compatibility mode with windows XP SP 2!

Right-click on Wavelab-app.exe in your WaveLab folder and select Properties. Enter Compatibility. Then set the compatibility mode to Windows XP SP2!"

Nothing ""stops"" here. It just takes AEONS!!! My PC is not very fast, and I was finished after 15 (FIFTEEN) minutes of waiting! Be patient!"

with  well written and good to follow instructions. This saves me a lot of work and time, because I had it running on another PC & on XP!

So: I owe you one, or two ! "
,driver76,2009-04-28T10:00Z,"Wavelab is ay overrated. Its cumbersome, an djust akward. Ut doesnt play back from start cursor position, you always have to manually move the curson as it follows the timeline and starts off from where you stooped. Pathetic for sound design. Its just really shit.

Soundforge blows it out of the water IMO"

In order to mend this problem, enter with your mouse the File-menu at the top of the screen:

1. Select ""Options"".
2. Select ""Scrolling during playback"".
3. Select ""Scroll wave (always).

Then the window will follow the cursor always; just like with any other wave-editor you're used to..."
,tymonstyle,2009-05-12T20:24Z,"Wow, what you mean take a while?
10 minutes max. with putting the wright .dll into the directory.
Works very very good, uping for you guys now.
