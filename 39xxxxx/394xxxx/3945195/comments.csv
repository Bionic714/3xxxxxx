Right click on the CUE file, select OPEN WITH, browse to NERO exe, click ALWAYS OPEN WITH box, insert CD, not a DVD!!!! it will NOT work, click Burn.

Get the beers and some snacks, stick CD into DVD player, relax and enjoy the movie. :-)

That way when you double click on the cue file it will open Nero ready to burn to a CDr, just pick the slowes speed like 8X for some reasons faster speeds can produce a poorer quality on some burners.  :-))"
