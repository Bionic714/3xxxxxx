,bleachxfan,2008-02-29T04:28Z,Will this work with a emulator?
,raedeon,2008-03-25T14:24Z,"Make sure you use PG2. This is being tracked by ESA, who are sending out infringement notices."
,Maurus,2008-03-31T19:54Z,"So no english text in game? Played this game in Thailand, seems like a wicked game!"
,Hatake Kakashi,2008-06-25T23:27Z,"adracamas, JAP or USA = NTSC
If you want this in PAL then convert it."

,newnar2004,2009-03-22T15:12Z,Do we just have to unrar part 1? What about the others? Do I need to do something to my pcsx2 before I can play the game?
,MS000086,2009-05-16T07:19Z,"I haven't downloaded this yet, but I'll answer some questions.

This game, if brought to America, will be most likely called Naruto Shippuuden: Ultimate Ninja 5 because the first Shippuuden game was the 4th. Don't ask me why. I'm just telling how it is.

Since this is a Japanese game, it does not have localization features (no English text or dubbing). Hopefully, it will be in English and in stores soon.

Since the file is split into many pieces, by extracted from the first file it will automatically do all the work for you (the magic of programing). From there burn imagine file that was extracted. Simple."
,MS000086,2009-05-16T07:27Z,"newnar2004, as WIKIDCLOWN mentioned, you'll need to get Magic Swap or mod your PS2. My advice is to get Magic Swap, so you won't have to mod your PS2. Magic Swap is cheap, and it works too without messing with your PS2. Make sure you get the right one though. The old version of Magic Swap won't work with the newer flat PS2."
,MS000086,2009-05-17T11:30Z,"Well, I can?t find my Swap Magic 3 (the DVD one at least), so I?m not sure if it works. I?m an idiot for losing it. I?m assuming it does, and I will post about my experience once I find the disk. Anyhow, my upload speed is pretty good, so all you lechers remember ye? old pirate code and remember to seed."

,MS000086,2009-06-03T09:58Z,"This works! (Yes, I found the Swap Magic...finally.) It gives my trusted seal of approval...whatever that's worth. Make sure you have either a Japanese save file from the third Narutimate (which I bought from Play Asia) or the first Narutimate Accel game; that way you can unlock the characters the characters from the original. I can't wait for this to be localized."
