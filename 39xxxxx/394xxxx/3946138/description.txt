It includes a CD ripper, CD/DVD Burner, and audio converter for saving music, and manual or automated playlist editors for creating music mixes. Its player automatically adjusts volume levels so that you don't have continually fiddle with the volume control and supports hundreds of Winamp plug-ins and visualizations; or if you prefer, it can use Winamp as the default player.It also includes portable audio device synchronization that allows you to synch tracks and play lists with devices such as the iPod and other portable audio devices.

Note:
- To give Norman Malware Cleaner the best working conditions possible, we recommend that you start the computer in Safe mode before running the program. To do this, tap the F8 key on your keyboard during startup, before Windows starts, and select Safe mode from the menu that appears.
- Pressing the F8 key at just the right time may be a little difficult (after the firmware POST process completes, but before Windows displays graphical output). If the F8 method does not work, repeat the procedure, but press the F8 key more quickly, or press it several times.
- On some (older) computers, the F8 key method may not work. In these Windows versions you may also configure your computer to start in Safe mode through the System Configuration Utility (msconfig).
- In some cases Norman Malware Cleaner may require that you restart the computer to completely remove an infection

Supported operating systems are: Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP and 2003

Abexo Registry Cleaner 5.3

RegistryAbexo Registry Cleaner is a utility software to make your computer run smoother and faster, achieving this by cleaning and compressing the registry. By time Windows registry gathers a lot of invalid entries that cause system complications and slow down your computer significantly. Included in Abexo Registry Cleaner is a registry defragmenter also called compressor which removes the empty spaces after a cleanup and thereby reduces registry size. Registry defragmentation increases the performance of your computer dramatically. Supported platforms: Windows Vista and Windows XP.

Abexo Registry Cleaner Features:
- Disk cleanup
- Scan disk
- Disk defrag
- Registry backup
- Registry cleanup
- Registry defrag
- Computer shutdown/restart

Registry is a database where Windows and programs store their data. When data changes i.e. you delete a file, the registry doesn't remove the invalid data, thus in this case a reference to a non-existent file remains in the registry.
As the registry gets filled with invalid data, Windows and programs consume more system resources to search the database for any data. Therefore your computer gets slower and slower. Last but not least, passing invalid data to Windows programs can cause severe system complications resulting in system crash, hang and malfunction.

After a registry cleanup the invalid entries leave empty spaces, which means the size of the registry remains unchanged. It goes without saying that loading a small registry is faster than a big one.

The Auto run feature is a one-click registry backup, registry cleanup and registry defrag.

Furthermore if you own a copy of Abexo defragmenter you can configure them to work together. Just click a button and go to bed. All of the following tasks will be performed while you are asleep.

Changes in Abexo Registry Cleaner 5.3:

Almost everything is done with a couple of clicks â?? adding picture frames, correcting your photos, making greeting cards, collages and slide shows, sharing your pictures on CDs/DVDs or your website and much more.
Ashampoo Photo Commander 6 is a one-stop solution. You organize and view your photo collection, edit and enhance your photos and use creative editing and project tools all in a single program. And it also manages your audio and video files!

New highlights in version 6:

Includes elegant Vista-style buttons in Windows XP and very cool transition effects when you switch between photos in full-screen editing mode.
Quick-Fix Tools
All the common operations you need to perform on your photos are now available in the Quick-Fix Tools tab: One-click color and contrast optimization, photo straightening (if the camera wasnâ??t straight), red eye correction, cropping, rotating and more â?? all with a couple of clicks.
Editable objects
You can add additional photos, text boxes, geometric shapes, arrows and more to your images. And now you can save them in a new file format that lets you go back again edit the objects again later without having to start right from the beginning.

It includes full support for capturing Windows Vistaâ??s transparent Aero Glass effects and capturing on multi-monitor systems. You can also capture free-style shapes as well as the standard rectangular objects and fixed shapes, and apply cool drop shadow, edge and shape effects automatically while capturing.
Quick 5-star rating system
Every photo displayed in the Organizer has a line of 5 stars under it. To rate your photo you just click for between 1 and 5 stars. You can then sort by star ratings to quickly find your favorite photos.
