I just want to thank you for making this torrent available.
And a big thank you to all those generous people that kept seeding for the benefit of others.

,Freaky_one,2008-03-01T15:35Z,what is this????
,busketissen,2008-03-11T21:42Z,"dose anyone know what program i can use to cut out the vocalist? i just wanna lisen to the melody, not the singing... plz help me:(:( sorry my english suck:P"
,barlam,2008-03-12T23:34Z,"Its very difficult to cut out the vocals on a regular music file. The programs that claim to do it don't cut out a piece of file, they just make parts quieter. In reality you need the original files from the recording to have a music track without the vocals. Hope this helps :)"
