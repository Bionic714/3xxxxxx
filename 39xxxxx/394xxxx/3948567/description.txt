CDR rip of bubblegum crisis 1980s anime series.  
Episode 7 Double Vision.

The anime here starts the early 90s trend of sharp angles, kinda lame. This is the last cool BGC flick, the others get too lame.


1980s out of print CDR rip, not much of a japanese copyright here.

I never had the CD to #4 so if you got em let me know.
I have more if you like, experimenting at torrenting and ripping to MP3s.  Enjoy.  Remy.
