,djpsychoinnorfolk,2008-08-10T00:30Z,Great show while it lasted..Thanks!!!!!
,freqazoidiac,2008-11-06T06:31Z,"hey..fabulous torrent.  works fine on my LG dvd combo player. Nice Quality considering it's from VHS tapes... Don't tune out now because of that fact.. you have to know , these episodes have the music intact still..the recent DVD release edits most if not all the original music out and put in Generic anonymous music...lame.  Did the poster of the torrent rip this..if so..what set and year did you rip this from..was it late 80's box set ..or just from TV? "
,huxley_edwards,2008-12-05T06:19Z,"Hey all..I stand corrected,, regarding my previous comment...ok.. Season 1 and 2 work in DIVX mode on my LG player, but season 3 and 4 seem of various quality..not being immediate compatible, and some quality suffering for 3 and 4.    I had to re-encode for DIVX playblack..  but that's all for  now. People..try to keep encoding quality constant if you could..makes life easier and no one has to waste double time. Thanks  for this fab series!"
,toastysausage,2009-03-06T19:24Z,"No complaints.
For those complaining about video, remember, a lot of the ""classics"" are converted from VHS which had dubious quality in itself.

,Biznass,2010-01-18T05:16Z,"Hands down the best ever was the Turkey's can fly ep, that followed by the live remote one from Del's stereo and sound.
Thanks for the upload.
will seed."
,MayarO,2010-02-20T00:24Z,"These are not the best quality on the planet, but they ARE watchable...two eps are missing from season 3, if anyone has them, please share and I'll get several friends to post the ENTIRE collection.

Thanks for this, I recall watching these in the original run, 3rd season ""Daydreams"" was -originally- an hour, syndication chopped out Bailey's dream, and they shortened everyone else's by about 3 mins each.  If someone has the ONLY AIRED ONCE version, lotta fans want it!"
,rococo2000,2011-02-27T21:19Z,"I just want to thank you so very much for putting this up..having the original show is very very cool..this is one of the BEST shows ever put on American TV..and having it intact is rare and very special..shit Im gonna bust out cryin...

merci beaucoup encore mon ami.."
,hashnew,2011-12-31T03:02Z,"Now the torrent has ""invalid data"".  Can it be fixed?"
,paulcx,2012-05-31T15:30Z,"There's another torrent here on TPB that may be based on these: they seem to be the exact same files (from a cursory look), but adds the two missing shows, and makes the titles more readable.  "
