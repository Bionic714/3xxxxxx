,Zeratuhl,2008-01-14T19:44Z,"boegroeff: Noone's holding a gun to your head and forcing you to watch/play this. If you don't like it then move on to something you do like and kindly stfu.

krazy: It's a cd image. Mount it in an application like Daemon Tools or burn it onto a cd with a program capable of handling that filetype."
,krazycro75,2008-01-15T02:58Z,"thnx zeratuhl, much appreciated"
,ildefonso,2008-01-15T16:55Z,I think boegroeff is gay...

,Humle1981,2008-02-14T16:18Z,"davidsolomon83:

Leave scandinavians outta it, if you must insult then atleast have the nerve to do it at your own field, instead of using other nationalities."
,tsArchitin,2008-02-28T13:38Z,"Well, at least donÂ´t forget where this server is at!"

,mother0fall,2008-07-31T06:36Z,"@ ice-ice:
mdf is a compression format better handled by either poweriso or magiciso.
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4302182/PowerISO_v4.2_Incl_Keygen-DIGERATI
or 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4318804/MagicISO.Maker-v5.5.Build.271(with_serial)
hope this helps."

Maybe nuclear radiation has deeper effects than Oppenheimer ever imagined."
,mgdeath02,2008-09-03T13:35Z,Is this game good??
,MattGo74,2008-10-16T20:15Z,"Why can't people just upload these games normal - no weird ""mounting"" whatever the fuck that is, no rar, no zip, no needing special programs?"
,fergulix,2008-10-22T23:28Z,"ty uploader, works fine just mount in daemon tools or w/e. Thou the action is somewhat lame, its alot of clicking and then finally you get to chose some option and then click away again.

Great if you want to learn japanese since they speak in it, thou the ""action"" is kinda just a few pictures.

Not worth playing imo."
,IseeingI2I,2008-10-30T16:26Z,god everyones is SO FUCKTARDED nowadays anywho burn this disc by mounting the .mds THE SAME FUCKING WAY you mount a .ISO or if u wanna burn it think of the .MDS like the .ISO  seriously everyone REEEEEAAAALY needs to learn what google is
,andre2027,2008-11-10T07:53Z,hmm... i've played this game ...and its good ...altough not very good in the storyline in my view ... 
,heavensdescent,2008-12-03T19:26Z,"omg people who dont know the format need to do a little research, if you want free stuff, dont complain about how you get it.  Plus image mounting is like the best way to install anything, it keeps files isolated and discs as a whole.  plus, its so simple anyone can figure it out.  use your brain please.  just go pirate Power ISO or something and mount.  "

help! anybody?"
,rajamolor,2011-08-14T16:02Z,"look like a nice game,,,"
,Rockeee,2012-03-26T17:57Z,"For those of you who are getting the ""Writing the data failed"" and ""AR read failed"" errors, this is because you have renamed the folder that the game was installed with.

Sadly it must stay as ""DISCIPLINE"" or you won't be able to save the game. So just go rename that folder and it should work without needing to change compatiblity."
