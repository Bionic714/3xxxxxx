,mrizzo2,2011-08-14T04:50Z,"Although your torrent description reads 
""Excellent classical music."", it is in fact ""Classy""
music, rather than Classical as that term is understood. A review of the files included show a great range within what is Classic taste of the best stuff on the whole. danke  gracias and merci too for a great upload.
