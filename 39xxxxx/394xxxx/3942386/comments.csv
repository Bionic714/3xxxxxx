,Savestar,2011-03-02T09:35Z,A Clockwork Orange is an overrated piece of shit ... I saw it as a kid and I found it profoundly sick and lacking of sense .. a result of a lunatic LSD raven madman ...I haven't changed my mind ... its CRAP ..CRAP ...CRAP ...and again : UTTER CRAP! -- People may uphold this movie as a masterpiece ..I still uphold it as a piece of utter crap! .You probably cant even tell my why explicitly why this is a masterpiece! Unless your a LSD raven madman .... and even then all your words will be mumbo jumbo ...
