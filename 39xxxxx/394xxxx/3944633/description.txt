This is the last show nirvan played ever. This was recorded in italy the night before Kurt cobain's first attempt to kill himself with Pain killers and champainge. This was briefly released in Italy but pulled from shelves after kurt cobains death two month after this concert.
This was porfessionaly recorded so its comparable to most live albums.
