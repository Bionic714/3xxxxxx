,NativeOne,2007-12-23T13:25Z,"Game looks very cool, kinda HoMM clone, but it crashes very quickly.. The tutorial only give 3 or 4 messages before i crash and campaign I could not even get trough a turn. 
Do the rest of you have same trouble? Any fixes out?"
,holmaren,2007-12-23T14:44Z,Have the same problem as you (NativeOne)... 
,al1984,2007-12-24T01:11Z,Got rid of second monitor and no crash
,Cibba,2007-12-24T15:41Z,"This game is so buggy you cant even play it.
In fights you kill all enemy's, still no win. You cant load games from fights so you need to go to main menu, witch you cant BC your in a fight...
the control panel sucks. 
this feels like a early BETA to me.

THERE ARE NO GRAFIC options(!!!!!)
It would take 5-6 more patches to be playable. 

DON'T BUY THIS CRAP, HELL DON'T EVEN DOWNLOAD IT - JUST A WASTE OF TIME!"
