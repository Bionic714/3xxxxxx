Another lovely bit of production by Leger... he knows exactly what he's doing when it comes to adaptation and stylisation of original works.  Don't forget to check for my previous post of his outstanding remix of "Larry Tee Ft. Princess Superstar - Licky (Work It Out)".


" Leger started out making bigroom house for Defected but over the years he's happily flitted been house, progressive, tech house, techno and electrohouse with 12"s for labels such as Hed Kandi, Pryda Friends, Intec and Pickadoll, as well as poppy rerubs of Justin Timberlake, Dave Gahan and Duran Duran.
