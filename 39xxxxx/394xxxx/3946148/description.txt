Have a Happy Life Day! 
And nothing kicks off a memorable Life Day quite so much as watching the legendary Star Wars Holiday Special receive a fully deserved Rifftrax treatment! 
Yes, all your favorite Wookies are here: there\'s Chewbacca, Malla, Itchy, Lumpy and Art Carney. 
Tony Award Winner and Oscar nominated Diahann Carroll as a singing holographic prostitute who services Grandpa Itchy. 
And Bea Arthur stretches her talent by playing a woman. 
Not only that, there are commercials from 1978 that will come close to convincing you that \"1978\" is fairly synonymous with \"Hell\".

Bill, Mike, and Kevin make this the itchiest, lumpiest Life Day of them all!
