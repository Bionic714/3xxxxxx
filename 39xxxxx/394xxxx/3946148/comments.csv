,JeffJedi,2008-09-11T08:04Z,Why is this a 4.34 GiB JPEG file? Is there a way to convert it back to a movie?
,iamafatguy,2009-02-05T05:23Z,"I don't have the disk space to download at the moment, but this is awesome!

Also, it's not a ""jpeg"". It's an img. Mount, then watch or burn."
,BomarJr,2009-08-18T00:44Z,seed please!
,Roberts_The_Vile,2009-10-23T11:13Z,"4 gigs? Are you fucking serious?

...great, it's the only one I can find of this RIffTrax after scouring every single torrent site I know of. Wonderful.

URRRRGGGHHHHH...this better be worth the tedium..."
,megatrends,2010-01-20T07:28Z,"Thanks for the share, this was so awesome!!!

For those of you having a hard time burning it the thing is an image file so choose burn image in your software."
,Kali_Flower,2010-12-22T13:08Z,"Yes, I know I'm a retard. 
Yes, I know I could piss off and figure it out myself.
But on the off chance that someone could help me out and tell me how to convert and burn this file- I use um...VSO ConvertXtoDVD 3... I would be very, very grateful. Thank you "
,niggerplz,2011-11-19T03:58Z,"There seem to be two versions on here, rifftrax and the 3.4gb one thats includes some extras. rifftrax has a sharper and more contrasted image, and includes all the commercials that aired in between segments. The 3.4gb version doesnt have any of the original commercials, though it features a short ad for the empire strikes back at the end, and it has the muppet star wars special and 30 minutes of star wars toy commercials.  They both seem to be fine editions depending on what you like. "

@every commenter,

V:?
A:?

@niggerplz in particular, it's safe to post links, could you specify which torrents you believe are best for each?  Is this one of any different quality than the 3.4gb version?"
