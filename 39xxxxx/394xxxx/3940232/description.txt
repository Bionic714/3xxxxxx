Overview:	A year before Lo Wei was to direct Bruce Lee?s first major starring role, Fist Of Fury, he wrote and co-starred in this tale of royal evil. He left the directing to Yeh Yung-tsu, who would go on to a notable directing/acting career himself. Here, Pai Yin, the star of King Hu?s classic Dragon Inn, plays the title character, a treacherous devil who wants nothing less than supreme power and doesn?t care if he has to murder the Emperor and use his own daughter as a deadly dupe to get it.
