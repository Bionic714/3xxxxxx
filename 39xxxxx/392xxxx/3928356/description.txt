1956


Classic movie with stop frame Harryhausen effects.



Dr. Russell Marvin heads up Operation Skyhook, which is tasked with sending rockets into the upper atmosphere to probe for future space flights. Unfortunately, all the rockets are somehow disappearing. While investigating this strange occurrence, Russell and his new assistant/wife Carol Marvin are abducted by a flying saucer. The aliens claim to be from Mars and demand to meet with Certain people in order to negotiate. But it was a trick, the Martains only wanted to kill them. The invasion has begun and if Russell and Carol can't find a way to stop these creatures and get past their defenses, it may be the end of the human race.

Even though the picture says colour (from one of many movies that were colourised, blech!), this is the original black and white version.
