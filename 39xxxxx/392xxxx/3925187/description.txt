George Winston - Winter Into Spring - Piano Solos
***************************************************************

In a sense, this second seasonal album follows an opposite direction from Autumn, its hard, isolated notes and stop-and-start style gradually giving way from the stasis of winter to the growth and movement of spring. It's a good album for beginning your day. ~ William Ruhlmann, All Music Guide
