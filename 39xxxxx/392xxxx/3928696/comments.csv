,BuddhaSearch,2008-09-21T18:56Z,"I'm wondering if this torrent is a dud.  On completion when I try to open the last 10 avi's (i.e. 15 - 24) in a variety of applications the applications will not open them.

I have had the p2p-client re-check the files and they come up as okay.  Still they won't open.

Has anyone else experienced these problems?"
,BuddhaSearch,2008-09-21T19:07Z,"WOW!!!!!!!

PLEASE COMPLETELY DISREGARD MY COMMENT ABOVE ON FILES '15 - 24'.

The comment is correct I've just attached it to the wrong torrent.

That said this torrent only has a 'udp' tracker and uTorrent doesn't use 'udp'.  If people who intend downloading this torrent could copy and paste the following lines into their p2p-client it might speed up the swarm a bit:

http://open.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce

http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce

(Well it would speed it up a bit if enough people do the copy and paste.)"
