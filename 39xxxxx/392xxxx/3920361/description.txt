Classic Chrome (1978 - 1983) for all you mutants out there. Finally there's a copy in lossless quality! 

----------------------------------------------
Tech specs:

Ripped the discs in EAC 0.99 prebeta 3 in burst mode. All the tracks that didn't check matching test & copy CRCs got re-ripped in secure mode. Check the logs for more info. Compressed with FLAC 1.2.1b. Disc 1 Track 11 "Mondo Anthem" had several audible errors. Ran that through the DeGlitch (http://members.home.nl/w.speek/deglitch.htm). It sounds fine now.
