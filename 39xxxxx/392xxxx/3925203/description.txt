Ode To Gallantry (Phillip Kwok, 1980) CN, Remastered - DVD/Rmvb

Plot: The second-to-last "Venoms" film. Kuo Chue takes on an amazing dual role and the complications and kung-fu which ensue are wonderful to watch. Even judged by exceptional "Venom" standards, this one stands out. 
 
Overview: After bursting on the kung-fu film scene in the internationally revered "The Five Venoms", and starring in many "bloody good" movies, this is generally considered the "Venoms" second-to-last effort...but what a penultimate adventure it is. Their usual hero, Kuo Chue, takes on an amazing dual role and the complications and kung-fu which ensue are wonderful to watch. Even judged by the exceptional standards of the "Venom" films, this one stands out.
