The Haikuware.com (http://www.haikuware.com) Weekly SuperPack is a preconfigured VMware image of the Haiku Operating System with a whole host of software installed on it for testing. 

Haiku OS (http://haiku-os.org) is inspired by BeOS and is intended to be 100% compatible with BeOS when R1 is released.
