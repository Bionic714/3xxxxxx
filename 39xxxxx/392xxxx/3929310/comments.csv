,grimsland.,2007-12-14T21:18Z,Anyone got an Activation ID for this ?
,jacflash,2007-12-24T14:00Z,"FYI this is a VERSION 3 language disc... it does NOT work with Version 2 of Rosetta Stone (aka most of what is out there).

It's a good torrent but if you don't have V3, don't bother."
,junkie06,2007-12-25T04:36Z,"Activation code, anyone?"
,dklingo,2007-12-27T20:00Z,I believe I may have found a way around the activation but I need level 1 spanish for version 3 can someone post this so I may share my crack with the group?
,addmaus,2007-12-30T11:06Z,"has anybody noticed that the language content is being copied to the harddrive and afterthat you donÂ´t need the emulated cd anymore? V3 told me it would copy the content to my harddrive, but I did not pay attention to the directory as I figured when I add another language it will tell me again... now I have spanish level 2 and level 3 installed, but V3 did not tell me the location, it simply installed level 3 to my harddrive... any ideas which directory? cause this means that every language installed takes up to 300 to 500 mb space..."
,cengaver,2008-01-07T23:52Z,"hey dklingo,
nice to hear that you have found a way around the activation. It would be very gentle when you share your crack with the group. Thanx a lot"

,laskagifts,2008-01-26T08:08Z,Anyone has Rosetta Stone v3 Spanish (latin america)  Level 1? I can't find it anywhere? 
,Eric090585,2008-02-08T18:30Z,Does anyone have Spanish (Latin America) Level 3 for Version 2? Please help! Thanks
,tylerdm,2008-02-12T05:11Z,I wish I could find version 3 of Level 1 somewhere.  It looks a lot nicer than version 2.

,tylerdm,2008-02-18T19:36Z,"gumbyhash, the file this torrent downloads is a rar, so you will need a program like winrar to unzip it. It might make a folder with all of the language files and folders inside, and you want to burn a cd with all of those files and folders. Once you burn those the disc should look just like your other language files discs and Rosetta Stone should give you the option to install it when it is in. Could you tell us where you got Level 1? Is there any way you could make a torrent of it or link to one with it?"
