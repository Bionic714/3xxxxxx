Here is the Rosetta Stone Spanish Level 3. I found this in some files someone posted in the comments section and unzipped and compiled to create the ISO image. I created a CD but have not installed or tested it to make sure it works or if you have to register it. To create your own CD, just unzip and burn the image to a CD.

I can't seed this too long, just at night and maybe over Christmas as the upload interferes with my VOIP.
