A Charming Disc, March 4, 1999
By A Customer
This collection finds Von Otter at top form and paired with a very sympathetic accompanist. (Would that Pinnock did more vocal pieces, his Haydn Mass is also lovely.) While I am not usually a fan of the scattershot recital approach, this one works. If you like either Von Otter (and how could you not?) or Pinnock, this disc is self-recommending.

A real gem on a great recording., February 27, 2007
By "xxx" (Hong Kong)
I have to tell you how horribly upset I was to have this CD stolen from me by my friends (who dared not admit it!)
I bought this together with Ms. Bartoli's "Arie Antique". I love both discs to death.
Ms. von Otter has a very different timbre from Ms. Bartoli. However, in terms of singing, both artists were at their absolute peak in those two discs.
My favorite song on this disc, Gluck's 'Oh, del mio dolce ardor bramato oggetto', though also an Italian 'antique' composition, was NOT on Ms. Bartoli's disc. Ms. von Otter sung it with such soul and voice that I really wonder (increasing more so these days) if Ms. Bartoli could be as good!
I heard both their 'Voi che sapete', and must say that I preferred von Otter's, though Bartoli gave an almost equally good interpretation in her own Mozart album.
Having reacquired this lost album recently, I would add that Ms. von Otter's interpretations in the rarer Mozart operatic works are a real wonder. Compared with Ms. Fleming's Mozart album wherein contained a number of Mozart's rare works, the singing of Anne Sofie von Otter clearly is of a much more convincing standard. As the singer herself puts it: 'On passionate women and moustaches', undoubtedly this disc demonstrates the full musical capability of hers in both genres to a fascinatingly high standard.

AN EXCELLENT VOICE! AND A VERY WELL THINK REPERTORY. I REALLY HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS BEAUTIFUL CD EITHER IF YOU LIKE THE GREAT VOICE OF VON OTTER OR THE CHARMING ARIAS OF MOZART, HAYDN AND GLUCK.
