The Gayatri mantra  S. P. Balasubrahmanyam ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._P._Balasubrahmanyam#Singer) 

The Gayatri mantra is a three line verse from a hymn in RigVeda. RigVeda is the most ancient of the Hindu texts (Vedas) and was composed more than three thousand years before the Common era.
The Gayatri mantra is attributed to sage Vishwamitra. He was born in a family of warriors (the Kshatriya class of the society) in northern India. It is said that by severe penance and meditation he availed the revelation of the Gayatri mantra, bestowed upon him by the Sun-God. Hence, the Gayatri is invocation to Sun-God. It is chanted in all important Hindu religious rites and ceremonies. Gayatri is first taught to youngsters during the sacred thread ceremony or the Upanayana ritual.

The mantra runs like this:

Om Tatsavitur Varenyam
Bhargo devasya dhimahi
dhiyo yo na prachodayat

\"Let us think on the lovely splendor
Of the God Savitr (the Sun)
That He may inspire our intelligence\"
