Then update using Virtualfem247up.exe.
Then update brain by extracting all files from d2.zip into your aiml folder inside install directory (just search a little inside install directory and you will find a folder containing other .aiml files)."

This is my first comment by the way.  Decided I needed to start giving some recognition to those who supply these great programs for our pleasure.  About to try and install add-on 1 now.

,sethamphetamines,2008-10-21T09:16Z,"If you have the black screen problem and are running vista, you need this patch
http://www.badongo.com/file/11199485"
,Thomas_Barger,2008-10-28T02:39Z,"for those that have vista right click the program and click properties, then under the compatability tab tell it to run it using windows xp with service pack 2 and it will work just fine."
,M3rr,2009-06-10T19:46Z,"doesn't run under compatibility xp sp2 
or just run as admin
or a combination of either with or without.

Not for all at least.
However After Patch works fine for me"

,cecilpaladin,2009-07-20T17:50Z,"You do need 2.4.8 patch to run this on vista (dont know about xp) someone should either send a link to the download or make a torrent of the vista and xp patch.

Just my oppinion this program rules."

,Jurosem,2010-03-20T10:13Z,"Hi, I see a lot of people talking about a black screen problem, but I'm having one of another kind. The game loads up fine but when I double click on one of the girls I get ""Runtime error '339': Component comdlg32.ocx or one of its dependencies is not correctly registered: a file is missing or valid."" And then the game shuts down. 
Running Vista 32. Tried both this torrent, and the other torrent of this game on Piratebay and got same problem with both. 
Anyone else? Any help?
Thanks"
