A Christmas Gift For You from Shankly to get you into the festive mood. The first two mixtapes are (almost) exclusively 2007 releases (there are one or two re-releases). The first is the kind of indie/alternative fare that you have come to expect and love from Shankly's mixtapes, the second is a more traditional Christmas mix for those of a different music taste. 

But wait! As if that wasn't enough Shankly has decided to shower us with even more blessings. Three more mixtapes comprising of Shankly's all-time favourite Christmas tunes are packed into this Christmas-Come-Early Musical Christmas Stocking. Forget Santa, beleive in Shankly instead!

This is the first of a load of end-of-year Shankly mixtapes to look out for.
