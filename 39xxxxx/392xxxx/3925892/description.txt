DVD2Xbox

dvd2xbox is a DVD/CD-R to hdd copy program for the xbox which supports the formats UDF/ISO9660/ISO9660/VideoDVD/CDDA (Audio 2 Ogg ripping with freecddb naming, dvd ripping with libdvdread). It provides a simple all at once copy mode and a win commander style disc browser.

Great cd/dvd/game ripping program for the original xbox, not the 360. It even allows for direct ripping to a smb network shared folder, meaning direct rip from xbox to pc. You can rip discs to .iso or in file format. Enjoy!
