Re-post.



All tracks contained here are simply outstanding productions, each a distinctly flavoured style of the excellent original by D. Ramirez & Mark Knight.

Also, I'm always very pleased to see Funkagenda on the case, who works closely with Mark Knight under the umbrella of Toolroom Records. If you haven't already, check out my previous posting of his remix of Robbie Rivera's "One Eye Shut"; you won't be disappointed.

I'm pretty sure we all already know who Gabriel & Dresden are!



Enjoy and please seed.
