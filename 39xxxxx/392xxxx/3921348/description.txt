It's a wonderful little white label jobbie from our esteemed friend, Dirty South... lots of stomping and bit of clapping.... yes we do like that; and, of course, we LOVE The Doors.


I just had a quick check the 'you tube', and this entry seems to be ever so popular.  Well... here's the real deal.



Enjoy and please seed.
