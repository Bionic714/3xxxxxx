MoÃƒÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ Horizons have been there or thereabouts in musical circles for the last eight years. Now itÃƒÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s time for them to break through with their fourth LP, on their own imprint Agogo.

Sunshine Today is a beautiful 13-track masterpiece, including a Latin cover version of the Bill WithersÃƒÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ classic Lovely Day.

The whole album oozes summer vibes - think of lazing by the pool, dipping your toe into the refreshing water, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½re getting somewhere close with this album.

But while the concept of the LP may be summer lazing and early evening shenanigans, the production is anything but laid back.

ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s intricate drum patterns, percussive straight up Latin dance, and groovy cocktails ÃƒÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ all blended together in a rich tapestry of rhythms.

MoÃƒÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ Horizons obviously know their Latin music, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s refreshing to see a group get it so spot on.
