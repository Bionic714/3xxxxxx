Subtitle: \'Rare and Previously Unissued Slices of Funk from the Vaults of Blue Note 67-70\'


Nine soul-jazz cuts from the Blue Note vaults from between 1967 and 1970, all previously unreleased, alternate takes, or (in one case) only released on a single, by major figures such as Grant Green, Lou Donaldson, Lonnie Smith, and John Patton...All of the aforementioned artists have better work in the style available on their own full-length albums, and some of the cuts are...adaptations of late-\'60s soul and pop hits. It\'s a good deal for the collector, though, offering over 70 minutes of material unavailable elsewhere.
