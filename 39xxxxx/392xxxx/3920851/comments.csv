And my second attempt is working but TPB doesn't accept any torrents that doesn't have its tracker in it.
Use this one plz.
And TPB sorry that I need to post a link to a competitor but I'm not going to make another one with just your tracker in it.
I'll make sure the next upload is double checked before it is posted."

Anyone actually got it working reliably?  Mine was fine unless I tried to use sample clips."
,AusGeno,2007-12-08T03:01Z,"At first it wasnt working but then I used the 1.1 exe fix I found posted by $TF at this link:

http://www.rlslog.net/ableton-live-v701-air/ 

I uninstalled all instances of Live, ran the .exe and then reinstalled only the AIR 7.0.1 release and it hasn't shown any problems since, hope this helps others."
,caynick,2007-12-11T10:34Z,"does this have the extra instrument packs included or is it too small?

""Essential Instrument Collection 2
The boxed version of Ableton Live 7 includes the Essential Instrument Collection 2, a multi-gigabyte library of meticulously sampled instruments providing a choice selection of acoustic and electric pianos, guitars, bass, drums, orchestral strings, brass, woodwinds and more."""

,NYCRocker,2008-01-30T11:08Z,Gotta problem. Yes this download installs and works great BUT it doesn't seem to have a preferences file. I jacked up the VST scan and now it's searching my entire drive for VSTs on loadup and crashing. A simple fix for this is go in and erase preferences.cfg but there is no such file with this crack. Uninstalling and deleting everything Ableton and reinstalling is no help. I have to find a way to delete the preferences or reformat my drive. Anybody know what to do? Thanks.
,eArtrash,2008-02-01T20:47Z,"NYCRocker:::I would suggest completely uninstalling ableton (again)

use search to search for ""ableton"" and delete manually, all fragments of it that didnt get removed by the uninstaller(you'd be suprised). then go to ""run"" and type ""regedit"" and search again for ableton and delete all related shit thats there (be careful u dont delete non-ableton shit) then restart ur computer and follow Ausgeno's instructions. Iv had the same problem in the past. as for your vst plugin problem...when u first run ableton it will ask u where u want your plugin folder, just make that in the program files folder, put ALL of your vst .dll files into a new folder (mine is C:/programfiles/myVstPlugins) and go into abletons preferences and set the default folder to ur NEW vst folder (ie C:/programfiles/myVstPlugins) this way ableton will not try and searech your whole system for vsts and crash like a mofo every time u run it. HOPE THIS HELPS!

good luck"
