Thanks for taking the trouble with the album art too."

,{me},2011-02-26T04:23Z,"Zublime, thank you for uploading, however as you have not included any details as to the quality of the contents I will have to pass on this torrent. Another torrent containing the same three albums is available: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4272790
The files in the above mentioned torrent are 320kbps which is what I personally am looking for and as I have downloaded them before I can confirm their quality.
In the future consider providing torrent quality details Zublime, as it helps your peers make a desision as to which torrent best matches their wants.
Thanks again for uploading.
Happy Pirating"
,{me},2011-02-26T04:31Z,"However, it is worth noting to those reading my above comment, that the other torrent is missing one file and this torrent has that song."
,Kasm279,2011-03-15T04:38Z,Anyone know what bitrate the songs are? 320kbit?
,mycurse92,2011-04-22T02:51Z,"@Kasm279
Think dude, 213MB download and 3 albums...
Of course not! xP
I'm guessing they are 160~192kb?"
,damnlian,2011-06-29T19:57Z,where the fck is the album Drowning Pool
,fuckjews,2011-08-07T22:18Z,thanks for the upload
,KiraPhusion,2011-08-14T14:28Z,"Wow, Damnlian, you must be retarded. Seriously. Look at the date this was uploaded. Do you see it? It says 2007. Now when do you suppose the self-titled album was released? I'm going to guess it's not before this torrent was uploaded. So fuck off and stop complaining. ^_^"
