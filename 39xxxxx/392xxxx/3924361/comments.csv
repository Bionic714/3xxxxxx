,TravisLonghorn,2007-12-07T02:04Z,does any one know why when torrenting it keeps going on and off like it is? my ports are forwarded so i dont know why it is doing this.
,TravisLonghorn,2007-12-07T12:11Z,"thanks for the help, i already had utorrent, but did not know about the dht thing. "
,balushyno1,2007-12-07T12:20Z,Hello travis thanx for nice upload plz send it till end bcz don't let great uploads to die soon i promise when i finish it i'll upload till when no peers remain.
,yontah,2007-12-07T12:42Z,"excellent up man!

"
,TravisLonghorn,2007-12-07T13:33Z,"i will seed it tell end and then some, i am glad that you like the upload :)"
,TravisLonghorn,2007-12-08T00:25Z,"sorry guys, i have to stop seeding it for tonight... my parents need to use the internet, but i will have it back up tomorrow with even better speeds. "
,TravisLonghorn,2007-12-08T06:42Z,"ok, i am now seeding again! but please, every one seed. i dont mean this as a theat but just as a way to speed up every thing. If i look down the list and find that no one is seeding or that they have limited there upload amount to 5kbps or somthing, i will cut the torrent... again, i am not trying to be mean i am just trying to keep this torrent going. "
,jorxster,2007-12-14T22:17Z,"I registered to say...
""SEED!"" 
If you would be so kind, Travis- as there really are 90 people waiting for this. You're the only one with the files."
,vdsltk,2007-12-15T22:46Z,How many videos are in this bundle?
,TravisLonghorn,2007-12-16T05:37Z,"sorry for the low seed rate, my parents have been doing there taxes and i am using up too much bandwidth so i cant torrent durring the day that much. sorry :(. but they wil be done soon and i will be back up to seeding as fast as i can. "
,piffi35,2007-12-16T13:55Z,"Please, Travislonghorn ""Seed"" I stuck at 40%.
so, I waiting for this video for a long time, thanks man!!!"
,TravisLonghorn,2007-12-18T11:36Z,"i am very sorry to every one dling this torrent. But your just gonna have to be REALLY pacient... i am seeding to over 40 leechers, so when i seed, download speed is still not high, and i cant seed much durring the day. I swear, i am not going to ditch this torrent, i will make sure every one has it before i leave it. It may take a month or so to transfer, but so what? just set a few of the files on high so that you get them first, and then watch those in the mean time while you are dling. This is not one of those torrents that requires you do dl the whole thing before you can use any of it... no, go in to the files tab and set a few of the movies to high priority... that way you will have them faster than the others and you can watch them now. "
,Arcane56,2007-12-19T08:12Z,"Hey trav, 
try limiting the amount of people you seed to. If ur upload is less then 50/kb try only uploading to something like 5 at a time. If other people are seeding and logging off and all the human stuff. IT SHOULD prove to be alot faster. Because some people are getting pieces faster, at the same time they're seeding pieces that no ones else has and it should grow like that (which is how torrents are meant to work). IF THE PEOPLE LEECHING SEED AT THE SAME TIME THAT IS DAMN IT. Give the guy a break, it's 24 fricken GIGS (rounding up)!!!"
,TravisLonghorn,2007-12-19T20:18Z,"Acran, how do i limit the amount of people i am seedig to? I never knew you could do that...

and Binkles, how do you know my old user name from demonoid??? it seems every one knows my old user name and i have no idea why!

oh, and vdsltk, there are like 40 something videos included in this package... is the digital tuters mega pack..."
,TravisLonghorn,2007-12-19T20:24Z,"ok, i have set the upload slot to 3... i am guessing that means that it will only upload to 3 people at a time. I hope that helps speeds a little"
,steezkraka,2007-12-23T07:31Z,"Yeah thanks Travis, will seed at least 2:1. But I'm stuck right now, PLS SEED EVERYBODY! Thanks :) "
,steezkraka,2007-12-23T18:31Z,"Great Christmas present! If this was all that I got, I would be quite satisfied! Just wish I had room on my Comp to download the whole thing (6 GB left), so I just pick and choose. In the summer though I will be getting a new machine, so I hope it will still be alive then so I can download the entire thing! 
"
,Tastefull,2007-12-24T17:34Z,"Please seed this, i'm on a 10/10mbit connection and can seed for a while after i get it. But the completion level of this is only 0.78 so no one have it."
,BigBobFX,2007-12-26T14:38Z,Don't bother with this.  Most of the videos I have watched from what I have downloaded so far are corrupt (i.e. they cut out half way through the video).  I think this is the same fella who did the nCloth introduction which also have two entire chapters of corrupt video and bust exercise files.
,BigBobFX,2007-12-27T02:49Z,"Um, 100% means complete.  As an example go to the Female Android CD1 and go play the first three video's, fine no problem.  Now play the fourth one, halfway through the lecture its quicks.  The video is DONE downloading, its just a shitty rip.  The problem is there are problems like this is just about ever 'set' included in this bundle.  "
,BigBobFX,2007-12-27T03:01Z,"Good Luck :) in the end why don't you do the rest of us a favor and weed out the shitty videos and make a new torrent of just the stuff that actually works, would save the rest of us a bunch and time."
,Fallout3210,2007-12-27T06:06Z,"The files on the discs work fine for me. If you cant get the CD to work properly try going into the actual CD and loading the file. 

For instance, if youre in Windows go to your disc drive and right click and go to open and go to the media folder. The movie files are all there and work fine for ME. "
,BigBobFX,2007-12-27T08:53Z,"Really? As an example, load up Female Android CD1 and go to video number 6.  I have it at 10,207KB and a running time of 1min 37sec.. The only problem is that at 1min and 37sec he is about 1/4 of the way through the actual lecture.  There are a few more video's that I have ran into this problem. "
,BigBobFX,2007-12-27T08:54Z,"I don't think ""Now what I""m going to do is"" is the end of the video."
,Fallout3210,2007-12-28T01:41Z,"Hey Bob,

I noticed the problem you were talking about. I'm not sure if its an issue with the actual rip of the CD.

I think its a problem with the actual Digital-Tutors CD because on the site you can actually see the full video to that particular chapter in full. Here is the link.

http://www.digitaltutors.com/digital_tutors/display_video_store.php?vid=542

If you see broken videos like this again its always good to check up on the Digital-Tutors website and see if they have the full video.

I hope this helped. Happy learning!"
,vdsltk,2007-12-29T00:05Z,I keep getting file error when i download the torrent and it opens up with shareaza anyone able to help me?
,vdsltk,2007-12-29T00:07Z,"and it says no sources, but on this site there are 36 people seeding so i dont know whats up."
,vdsltk,2008-01-02T00:11Z,"Never mind i downloaded uTorrent and so far it has been downloading, TravisLonghorn thanx for this up and i cant wait to check it out"
,TravisLonghorn,2008-01-02T04:33Z,"wow... i leave for a couple of days to come back and find that some one is spreading false rumors of this torrent being corrupt. Please ignore what BigBobFX is saying... i assure you that each and every video on this torrent works perfectly.... BigBobFX, i suggest you try re downloading them. If you download them with utorrent, unzip them winrar, mount them with poweriso, and watch them with vlc player or quick time, every thing should work fine... "
,BigBobFX,2008-01-02T14:26Z,"Well they are not rumors and they are not false.  Don't get me wrong, its a great torrent lots of good stuff, but not all your video's in this series are 100%, sorry, the data simply isn't there.

As mentioned above, however, you can go to the DT website and pick up a few of the videos that are toasted.  

Going back through them I can't find the series were I came upon corrupt exercise files, but I do know for a fact (and confirmed above) that at least one of the videos in the android series is toast.

Several of the other video's have a weird audio noise... highly annoying but still watchable."
,TravisLonghorn,2008-01-07T12:12Z,"Bigbobfx, exactly which videos dont work for you? I have tried nearly every video in the pack from the folder that i am currently uploading to yall, and it appears that every single video is working. Plus you are the only one who i have heard that these dont work with. Every one else is saying they work fine for them. What i think you should try and do is redownload the files, i dont know exactly why they will not work for you, but it has to do somthing with them becoming corrupt. Downloading them will not take nearly as long as before now that we have more seeders. "
,balushyno1,2008-01-13T11:47Z,Oh Thanx(Y)(Y)
,fullvernian,2008-01-19T13:08Z,"I'm having a problem with videos no. 18 and 19 in the female android cd 2.
The former stops at the 3:00 min. mark
and for the latter I get an error that says it's not a video file.

Am I the only one getting that problem?"
,projectpat,2008-01-20T22:20Z,"im new to all this so if you can help i would greatly appreciate it.  I downloaded this to my mac and now am unable to run the ""start_here_osx"" how do I get it to play.  also all the .mov in the media folder you can here being narrated but has a still image.  What am I doing wrong."
,godofcomics,2008-01-27T01:01Z,"projectpat, its easy to fix, just look inside the Digital Tutors folder, and look for a codec, install it and fly high. If you can't find it, go to digitaltutors dot com and find the codec there. "
,godofcomics,2008-02-02T00:46Z,"I just want to say here, I downloaded and seeded for a few days. I tested almost all the CDs and this package is FLAWLESS, download it its worth it."
,mrhahn530,2008-02-13T06:05Z,"Hey just thought I'd say DON'T STOP SEEDING THIS EPIC TORRENT.

I'm at 42% on my shitty bellsouth connection so it'll be a while...

Must...have...tutorials...;-)

Great job man!"
,littlesilas,2008-02-18T23:57Z,"cant open the iso files, can't burn them to CD? How do I look at these? I downloaded it all, used stuffit expander, but can't do anymore with it.."
,mrhahn530,2008-02-21T17:01Z,"littlesilas,

I unRARed the files with Auto Unpack and mounted the iso's with deamon tools and it works like a charm.  Just make sure you have quick time installed and you should be good...

My only problem is downloading the last 20% of this file...its giving me like 2kbs... "

,Nishua,2008-02-27T01:13Z,"This is a great torrent. I haven't had the opportunity to finish downloading it. Please keep this up. You have no idea how bad I want this. ""TravisLonghorn"" thank you so much."

,TravisLonghorn,2008-02-28T04:20Z,Thank you EVERY ONE! Damn... i had to reinstall my OS like a month ago and i had to ditch the torrent. I thought it would go dead but here i am a month later and it is still spreading! Thank you seeders for keeping this torrent going!
,Viraii,2008-03-05T15:48Z,"We need more seeds, I will seed when done. averaging 0.2-3kbps."

,Bamb1zzle,2008-03-19T04:30Z,"Yo once again Mr. Longhorn has come through for all the aspiring animators out there. Thanks alot TL, this is great. By the way all the videos were 100% flawless. Good looking out TL, keep em coming."
,Nobody315,2008-03-19T09:19Z,For some strange reason all my digital tutors files are now crashing. they were all running perfectly fine but when I went to fire one up today it crashed as I started a lesson. I attempted to run several other digital tutor iso''s and encountered the same problem every time. Anyone else having similar issues?
,ceg.ray,2008-03-21T22:11Z,"Wow.. this list is IMPRESSIVE.  I've been downloading straight for days to get this thing done.  I hope I'm able to finish before everyone quits seeding.  

Awesome job, TL, and I certainly hope to be able to get to that fabled 100% complete! Keep up the good seeding work, guys!"

,victor56517,2008-04-06T08:49Z,"Please seed... I got about 0.1% per day so if I just get 0.1% per day it will take me about 3 years (1000 days) to download and then this torrent XD wont be up to date at all with the latest maya verisions, so for gods sake seed, and dont just hit-and run because then it will take forever. Personally I will seed this great mega-super sized toorent for a long long time...

So please SEED...                     thanks :)"
,vdsltk,2008-04-23T04:13Z,"victor56517 do u use utorrent? if not try it its the best for gettin torrents, it worked for me to get this big a$$ file, and its worth it...."
,w0tness,2008-04-23T23:37Z,"Don't bother downloading this crap torrent. All the tutorials are sabotaged, cut off at some point before completion. Sure you'll learn something, but the annoyance of the vid being shorter is just so fucking .. annoying!
I was doing the android modeling, and the last part of the last video in chapter one was cut off, so now I have no idea how to finish what I spent lots of time doing... crap!"

,Shadow_Jedi,2010-01-02T10:48Z,@ FELLOW PIRATES: I just wanted everyone to know that this torrent is downloading 'extremely' fast even now; contrary to earlier comments about it being slow. This seems like a GREAT download and TravisLonghorn deserves a skull or an entourage of fist pounds for this torrent alone. If you use Maya than you know how extremely valuable these files are; not to mention their price. Many thanks to the uploader and the seeders who have kept this torrent zipping along!
