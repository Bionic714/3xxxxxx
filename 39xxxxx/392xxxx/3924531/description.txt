In today's series of movies from 1988, we find Pee-Wee in a romantic role.
This is not a sequal to Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.  In my humble opinion I liked this one far better than the Burton treatment. Burton seems high on imagery, low on story, sorry.
Kris Kristofferson also stars.

This one has an optional French soundtrack, and English subtitles.
Uncompressed NTSC iso.
