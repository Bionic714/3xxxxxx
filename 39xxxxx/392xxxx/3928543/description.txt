BALI BOMBINGS COVER-UP: New documentary

Released on Youtube and Googlevideo this week, FOOL ME TWICE, exposes the cover-up of the Bali bombings and provides evidence that it was a Falseflag Operation.

The film begins by documenting the Australian governmentÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s prior knowledge of the Indonesian militaryÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s plan to use violence to maintain autonomy over East Timor. Contrary to The Howard Governments claims they argued against peacekeeping forces allowing the Indonesian Special Forces to carry out their campaign of fear and suppression.

Within 24 hours of the 2002 Bali bombings a team of FBI, UK special agents and Australian federal police started arriving in Bali. The investigation team continuously claimed different explosive devices were responsible for the main blast. Days after the attacks, Indonesian Police Chief, General DaiÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ Bachtier, announced that the FBI had discovered C4 pointing the blame towards Jemaah Islamiah, JI (Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½SE Asia wing of Al qaedaÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½). Eventually, investigators concluded that the main explosive device was a potassium chlorate car bomb. C4 was never included in final reports.

The main explosive device was so powerful it seriously damaged buildings in a 2/400 metre radius and left a 1 metre deep, 10 metre wide crater. 202 people perished in the blasts, the majority incinerated from the main explosive device. Investigators quickly excavated the crater contents and dumped the remaining debris off the coast of southern Bali, including completely stripped concrete reinforcing bars. Potassium chlorate is a low velocity explosive and does not have the overpressure force to create a 1 metre deep crater or completely incinerate humans, let alone strip concrete. Only a high-tech explosive device has the power to strip concrete.

FBI claims of C4 announced by General DaiÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ Bachtier, ensured Jemaah Islamiah was immediately blamed for the Bali bombings. All prior intelligence of the Bali bombings came from so called JI leader, Omar Al-Faruq. Omar Al-Faruq was secretly handed over to the US by Indonesia months prior to the bombings under the CIAÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s extraordinary rendition program. Australian intelligence agencies reported that intelligence obtained from captured Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½JI suspectÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½, Omar Al-Faruq, warned of possible terrorist attacks in Bali. After the attacks the Bush administration denied access to Al-Faruq for questioning in the Bali bombing trials. When Omar Al-Faruq was suddenly called by US court to provide evidence in a trial of another terrorist suspect Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ he had Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½escaped high security prisonÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½. No JI leaders have ever been brought to trial.

Prior to the Bali bombings the Indonesian government denied the existence of terrorists within Indonesia and opposed US anti-terror operations in Afghanistan. After the bombings President Megawati signed a joint statement Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Agreeing that terrorism poses a continued threat to international peace and security, and that the two Presidents are committed to enhancing their bilateral cooperation in the fight against terrorismÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½. The Bush administration provided funds to the Indonesian police and military and setup a national terrorism unit under the control of national police chief, General DaiÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ Bachtier.
