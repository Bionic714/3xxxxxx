Team Fortress 2 with 1.0.11 patch and I modified the GameMenu.res to help you play on free server.  No custom background.

Packages create with Innosetup and splitted in 4 file to make it fit on 4 CD

How to burn those files?

On CD:

CD1 = Create a Datacd and put setup.exe and setup-1.bin on it
CD2 = Create a Datacd and put setup-2.bin on it
CD3 = Create a Datacd and put setup-3.bin on it
CD4 = Create a Datacd and put setup-4.bin on it

To install, run setup.exe from CD1, and it will tell you when to change the cd.


On DVD:

DVD1 = Create a DataDVD and put everything on it (setup.exe, setup-1.bin, setup-2.bin, setup3.bin, setup4.bin)

To install, run setup.exe from DVD1.



Have fun
