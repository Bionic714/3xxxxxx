,zippea,2007-12-21T22:51Z,"Works great! Just a question..How do I change my in game name from aCaDiEn? There's nothing in game as far as settings...I've read the name is pulled from the steam Community name...but steam isn't running. I swear I've checked all the Steam Emu files, but I can't find it anywhere. Help?"
,Spawn of Chaos,2007-12-22T00:48Z,"Bring down your console and type name ""name goes here""

THANK YOU FOR THIS!"
,ZQFarnzy,2007-12-22T04:30Z,"It won't run, tells me there's no gameinfo.txt"
,ZQFarnzy,2007-12-22T04:39Z,"Disregard that,I had no idea what I was doing.But... how  do you find servers you can play on with this copy?"
,Spawn of Chaos,2007-12-22T08:18Z,"SEEDERS, WHY ARE YOU NOT UPLOADING?  I have 11 seeders...getting 1 KB/s from ONE of you!

WTF!"
,Spawn of Chaos,2007-12-23T09:36Z,33 seeders...11 KB/s...WTJ?!
,dartb,2007-12-23T15:17Z,"Count yourself lucky, I've peaked at 1.8kb/s -_-"
,Spawn of Chaos,2007-12-25T03:31Z,Ok...so now what do I do to get it to show up on my games list?
,dartb,2007-12-25T14:11Z,"Well, I've seeded this three and a half times over, I'll keep seeding seeing as one guy is getting 50kb/s off of me and I'd feel guilty if I cut him off to plug my DVD burner in (1 IDE controller fucking FAILS).

...or I could just install from the file.  That makes so much more sense -_-"
,Genoc1de,2007-12-29T21:52Z,Good job! Fast download and I already seeded 3.0 ratio!
,Genoc1de,2007-12-29T22:49Z,"But now it says it cannot find the gameinfo.txt

It stays there and eventually it exits by itself. I think it has to do with this -steam -novid -noforcemaccel -noforcemparms -noforcemspd -game tf thing. how do i paste it to the shortcut target!?!??!
,TheElholm,2008-01-31T21:58Z,"What was it i should do with this line....

-steam -novid -noforcemaccel -noforcemparms -noforcemspd -game tf

Was it on the screen shortcut or in the gamefolder?"
