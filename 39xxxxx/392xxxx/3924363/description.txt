Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is an installment of the Grand Theft Auto series, and as of July 2007 is the best selling game so far for the PlayStation Portable.[verification needed] It was released in the United States on October 25, 2005 and in the United Kingdom (UK) on November 4, 2005. The official site credits Take-Two Interactive companies Rockstar Games, Rockstar North, and Rockstar Leeds in the creation of this game.[2] The game has since been followed up by Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories.

A port for the PlayStation 2 was released on June 6, 2006 in North America for a recommended retail price of US$19.99, June 22, 2006 in the UK and the rest of Europe for GBP Ã?Â£19.99 or EUR Ã¢ï¿½Â¬29.99, respectively.[3][4] The pricing of the PS2 port is less than half the typical price of a big name new release title (the first three PS2 installments of GTA debuted at US$49.99 each). The PS2 port does not feature the multiplayer mode or custom soundtrack ripping capability of the original PSP version.

[edit] Setting

The game is set in Liberty City (the same city featured in Grand Theft Auto III). However, it takes place in 1998, three years before the events of GTA III. Toni Cipriani is fresh back in the city after lying low for several years, having offed a made man as a favor for Don Salvatore Leone. The grateful Salvatore puts him straight back to work. During the course of Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, players can accept a variety of missions from many people, including Salvatore, Salvatore\'s wife Maria, JD O\'Toole, wise guy Vincenzo \"Lucky\" Cilli, and even Toni\'s own mother.

Although the game is set in 1998, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, which was set in 1992-1993, featured a club called \"Sex Club Seven\" in The Introduction but the club \"Sex Club Seven\" is named in Liberty City Stories as \"Paulie\'s Revue Bar\". During a mission where you have to dispose the body of \"Paulie\'s Revue Bar\" owner, J.D.O\'Toole, the club gets revamped into \"Sex Club Seven\" when it gets bought by Luigi, one of the characters of the game. This doesn\'t make sense as if the club was \"Sex Club Seven\" in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and \"Paulie\'s Revue Bar\" in Liberty City Stories. This is most likely to be because of a continuity error.

[edit] Gameplay

The ways to get from island to island have also been tweaked. A ferry now runs from Portland Island to Staunton Island, and the tunnel that connects the islands in Grand Theft Auto III has not yet been completed - only the section of the tunnel that runs from north Shoreside Vale to south Shoreside Vale is open. The Callahan Bridge (the bridge that was blown up in Grand Theft Auto III) has also not been fully constructed yet. Only after the mission \"Driving Mr. Leone\", which occurs at around 19% completion, can you actually traverse the bridge as its construction progresses.

In addition, motorcycles were previously permitted in the city. The official Liberty City Stories website reveals that motorbikes were banned by the turn of the 21st century, due to a public ordinance supported by the Maibatsu Corporation (which marketed the over-sized Maibatsu Monstrosity in GTA III) in order to promote the use of automobiles in the city.

Though airplanes and helicopters make appearances in the game, planes normally cannot be piloted. And while helicopters can be piloted, there is no official way to do so aside from stealing one in a specific mission, or with the help of Edison Carter\'s CheatDevice (which is only available for PSPs with the firmwares: 2.50, 2.60 and Dark_Alex\'s Custom Firmware up to 3.40 OE-A). The Dodo plane can be spawned and piloted with the CheatDevice as well.

[edit] Multiplayer

The PSP version of Liberty City Stories has a multiplayer mode, for up to 6 players through WiFi ad-hoc mode (same area). The game features 7 modes of wireless multiplayer gaming, in which various pedestrian and character models from the single player mode are available as player avatars. Rockstar decided not to include these modes in the PS2 version.

[edit] Graphics

As stated in an IGN preview, \"Rockstar dropped Renderware in favor of a brand new in-house engine to best utilize the resolution, texture density and particle effects of the PSP\".[5] RenderWare has been the game engine behind every GTA since GTA III (which includes GTA III, GTA: Vice City and GTA: San Andreas).

[edit] Custom soundtracks

A special feature (only in the PSP version of the game) is the ability to listen to custom soundtracks.[6] Previously, only Grand Theft Auto games on the Xbox and PC were able to implement custom soundtracks. When Liberty City Stories was released, the custom soundtracks option was featured in the \"Audio\" section of the menu (by pressing Start in gameplay) but did not have any use. Many people posted on various internet forums asking how to use the feature. At one time, it was thought that these custom soundtrack abilities had to be unlocked, but this would have been very unusual since previous games did not do this.

A few days after release of the game, Rockstar placed the application called \"Rockstar Custom Tracks v1.0\" on the official site under the \"Downloads\" section. This then gave people the chance to use the custom soundtracks feature. The application appears to be based on Exact Audio Copy.

In the application, songs from a CD are ripped, compressed, and converted to files that can be read by the game. Rockstar Custom Tracks (RCT) only allows the ripping of songs that are from a store-bought CD. However, fans have found a way to compress and convert MP3 files that are not burned onto CDs[1]. RCT can also look up and use the names from the FreeDB server if there are no names for the song(s). There must be at least one save file in order for RCT to work. It is thought that this will be used for other games Rockstar will release on the PSP from the name. More details can be found in the PDF in the file downloaded from the official site.
