to play it on a psp with 3.71m33 you simply connect to the psp through a usb cable and put the game in the ISO folder.

if you dont have this folder you can create it yourself in the root directory or you can format you memory stick which will make the folder for you

to format goto setting>system setting>format memory stick

once the game is in the iso folder turn off you psp all the way and the start it again while holding the ""r"" trigger. this should load recovery mode. 

once in recovery mode go to:
configuration>umd mode and change it to sony NP9660 -NO UMD-
back
cpu speed> speed in UMD/ISO change it to 333

now game should run without lag

if that doesnt work get psp ico compressor 1/4 and convert it to a jso"

,aijiman,2008-01-25T01:12Z,"ok to all the people with questions.  this game is in cso format.  this means you can just drop it in the iso folder.  if you have a psp with a custom firmware all you have to do is plug in your psp, then  open the directory and you should see certain folders such as psp, mproot, i cant remember the others but there should be one that says iso.  its as simple as taking the cso and dropping it straight in that folder.  thats it.  nothing else.

as for the question about downgrading.....a while back it seemed convenient to have an older firmware such as 1.5 so you could run nes games and such, but now its really easier to get something like 3.8 and add the 1.5 kernel.  you should google ""psp custom firmwares"" and download the one you need.  to determine this you should go to system settings, then system information on your psp.  here it should tell you your firmware.  whatever version you have, you should work your way up till you get to 3.8 m33-4.  i beieve thats the newest one out currently."
,Gross14,2008-01-30T16:04Z,what should i do to get the game working on my psp?
,muchus666,2008-02-07T14:29Z,"you should short down the filename, the file didn't show in the xmb before I changed it to GTA.cso that's the solution ;)"

,waipaissi,2008-04-06T19:26Z,"Thanks redman for this awesome game! You are the man :)

,wonderboy52,2008-04-20T19:08Z,i have bullshit jew homemade firmware and it works perfect
,Pickletron,2008-04-23T09:28Z,Is this the USA version or EUR?
,Pickletron,2008-04-23T12:22Z,"This was a really fast download, thanks a lot to all you seeders. The game works fine, just make sure you set your PSP's CPU speed to 333MHz or it can slow up a bit. It also helps if you use one of the many compressor/decompressor programs to decompress the file to a ~1gb ISO file which helps it go a bit faster.

Final note, this is the US version which will effect the way you add custom tracks to the game. (The file names will be different for the US/EUR versions)
If you want to add custom tracks to the game while you're playing just google ""PSP GTA RST"" and find one of the many guides scattered around. (Mine was off a GameSpot forum post)

Thanks again to Redman and the seeders."
,Pickletron,2008-04-23T12:23Z,"Triple post but you google ""PSP GTA RCT"" not ""PSP GTA RST"". Sorry 'bout that."

,clyde.morris0217,2008-07-12T05:17Z,"ATTENTION ALL THAT HAVE TROUBLE WITH THIS!

First, do what redman32191 has instructed in the first comment of this torrent.  Then do what muchus666 said and change the file name so it's shorter.  This worked for me and it runs perfectly!

Also, Kaspersky reported that there were no viruses/malware of any kind!  GREAT TORRENT! 

Thanks!"

,unusingur,2008-08-20T04:18Z,"i think the easyest way to play this game on your psp, if you don't know shit about custom firmwares and umd ISOs and CSOs, is to buy it ;)
i mean lots of people seem to kill theyr brains trying to ""solve"" the mistery of playing a game they crave for, but they won't spend like 30 bucks to buy it, wich is quite idiotic, really :)"
,gravitylb,2008-09-09T22:45Z,"unusingur

i understand what u mean but to most of us, like me, its not only the need to play the game but the need of feeling the accomplishment of being able to make them work.
