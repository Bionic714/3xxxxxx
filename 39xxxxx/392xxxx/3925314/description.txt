Nosfell 1/12/2007 ThÃ©atre de Arras

MZ-NH700->SP-CMC2/SP-SPSB8 (bass roll-off 107hz)->digital transfer on PC->boosted right channel +7Db and 15Db when Nosfell is speaking with Soundforge8->Flac

Sounds a bit distant but overall quite good recording

I tried my best for making separate tracks of the "extra intros" of the songs, the ones which are not originally played on the CD. That way you can either straightly listen to the song more or less like you are used to, or with the complete live special version.

Features a cover of Tom Waits, Chocolate Jesus.
