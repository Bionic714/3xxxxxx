Take an intimate look at college life in the gritty romantic comedy PiGS. Miles (Jefferson Brown) is smooth, smart and attractive - the definitive ladies' man. After returning from yet another successful conquest, Miles' best friend Cleaver (Darryn Lucio) has the idea for Miles to try and "complete" the entire alphabet prior to his graduation. Goaded on by his dorm mates, Miles accepts and the contest begins. The rules are simple: the rarer the first letter of the girl's last name, the higher the odds. Money and pride are on the line, and all is going according to plan, until Miles comes face-to-face with the captivating Gabrielle Xeropolos (Melanie Marden), aka: the "X". She's everything Miles has ever wanted in a girl. Now he's torn between his ever-growing feelings for Gabrielle, and his allegiance to his testosterone-filled dorm buddies. The ultimate question remains - are all guys PiGS?
