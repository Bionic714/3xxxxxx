,Endotech,2008-01-19T16:37Z,When you load this image it tries to access the internet and download content
,tee_m,2008-02-27T14:41Z,"To avoid that something it tries to download or do:
unpack the file (for example) with winrar and launch setup.exe (dont mount or burn)

there is some autorun.exe whichs icon already looks like a some virus, so it can be DELETED setup and game works good without it. i just tested."
,tee_m,2008-02-27T14:47Z,if someone finds the autorun.exe useful to any purpose let us know.
,vnmp1984,2008-03-21T04:05Z,Does anybody know how to get this to work?  The game installs but when I open it and hit play it exits out of the game and back to the windows screen.
