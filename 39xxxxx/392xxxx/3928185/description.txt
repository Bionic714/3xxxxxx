The Bratz are excited about their first year of high school! 
However, Meredith, the conniving school class president, 
formulates a plan that splits up the girls and the entire school
into different cliques. But the Bratz aren't so easy to defeat. 
They decide to collaborate in order to break up the cliques and
teach them that they are more than who they hang out with. The 
Bratz unite all of the students in one fabulous act to compete 
in a talent show that will bring everyone together and help them
to overcome each others differences.
