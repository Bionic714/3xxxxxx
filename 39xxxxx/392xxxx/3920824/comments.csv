,50Guns,2007-12-04T18:24Z,LOL OMG ROFL this is the real FAKE shit the full heroes season 2 hasent even come out yet losers who dawnload this
,jackmase,2007-12-04T19:16Z,if you see the file list it shows that this is the first 11 episodes of season 2 so the title is misleading..
,entropic_soul,2007-12-04T19:48Z,"NBC billed the 11th episode as the end of Season 2 because of the writer's strike. So this is, in fact, the complete Season. The original episodes of 12-24 will be aired as ""season 3"" after the strike is over."
,jackmase,2007-12-04T21:13Z,"series of the same e.g lost,prison break,24 etc have all 23-24 episodes per season as too had season 1 of heroes.this is no different,half way through season 1 of heroes there was a break and then came back with 2nd part of the season.this will happen here again so this is not the complete 2nd series,just part 1 of the second season.."
,pether,2007-12-04T22:26Z,"If you watch episode 11, you will see that they call it the end of volume 2, and then start at volume 3 in the last minutes of the episode."
,possum64,2007-12-08T16:46Z,"It only goes through eleven episodes because of the writer's strike in America, guys."
,xnetx,2007-12-10T01:28Z,"u fol me one u na gonna fol me 2's, It only goes through eleven episodes because of the writer's strike in America, guys. lol, take it eazy people"

Read it and you'll understand

I was wondering too, But at the end of the 11 episode you can see that it says ""End of Volume Two""


Sorry if i didnt wrote it in the Describtion but thats the way it is..."

,Ezekyle,2008-10-01T23:52Z,"This is indeed the complete second season, and a great torrent. Thanks Tukotih.

But just to be an arse, I would like to point out the Heroes' ""Volumes"" is nto equal to seasons - Sure enough, Season one was Volume one, but season two was meant to have both Volume 2 and 3. Due to the writers strike, the original volume 3 (""Exodus"") was cut, though. Instead of letting season 2 ""take a break"" the volume was scrapped, and replaced by a new volume 3 (""Villains""), that kicks off season 3. Season 3 will consist of both Volume 3 and 4 (""Fugitives"").

So, you are right about this being the complete second season, but it's more of a sad(since an entire storyline was cut) coincidence. Coincidence or not, though, this is the complete second season, and thus a complete torrent. Nice upload:)
