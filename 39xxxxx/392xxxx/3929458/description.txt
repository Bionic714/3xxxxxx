Inspired by synth-pop pioneers like Ultravox and New Order, B-Movie wrote catchy songs enveloped in keyboards.The group was signed to the Some Bizarre record label in the early '80s; in 1981, the band appeared on a Some Bizarre compilation album with future '80s synth-pop superstars such as Depeche Mode, Blancmange, and Soft Cell. In 1982, the single 'Nowhere Girl' was a hit in Europe.
