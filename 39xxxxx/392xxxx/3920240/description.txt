BIOGRAPHY

Antonella Ruggiero was born in Genoa, Italy and made her first recording, Io Matia ("I Matia" in English), in 1974. Matia is the stage name under which Antonella Ruggiero officially began her solo career with the first and rare 45 rpm vinyl record, however had already collaborated (unofficially) with the Jet in their LP vinyl record â??Faith, Hope and Charityâ?? lending her leading voice in the choruses. It was from the union of some members of both the Jet and Matia that in 1975 the Matia Bazar were born.

In 1975 with Piero Cassano (Voice and Keyboards), Aldo Stellita (Bass), Giancarlo Golzi (Drums), Carlo Marrale (Voice and Guitars) she gave birth to the historical group of Matia Bazar. The unique voice of Antonella Ruggiero in concert with the innovative ability of the other musicians, led the group to achieve outstanding acknowledgments throughout Europe. Important pop hits followed year after year: â??Ma PerchÃ©â??, â??Solo Tuâ??, â??Per Unâ??ora dâ??Amoreâ??, â??Stasera Che Seraâ??, â??Cavallo Biancoâ??, â??Il Video Sono Ioâ??, â??Mister Mandarinoâ??, â??Ti Sentoâ??, â??Vacanze Romaneâ??. Her partnership with the group lasted for seven years. In 1989, she made her solo debut with the album â??Liberaâ??, the result of a cathartic journey carried out in new cultural and musical atmospheres.

In the 1998 edition of the Sanremo Festival placed second with â??Amore Lontanissimoâ??, which also earned the critic's prize for best arrangement. In 1999 she stood up at the Ariston Theater stage with â??Non Ti Dimentico (Se Non Ci Fossero le Nuvole)â?? written together with her husband Roberto Colombo, and was classified in second place again. This song was dedicated to Aldo Stellita, former stage companion (was founder member/author/bass player of the Matia Bazar) and for many years her friend, who died prematurely in 1998. Immediately after the festival, Antonella released her third CD as soloist, "Sospesa". This album included two memorable participations: the master Ennio Morricone who companied "And Will You Love Me" and Giovanni Lindo Ferretti who co-wrote"Di Perle e Inverni" with Antonella and Roberto Columbo.

Her vocal ductility, the musical taste, her strong emotion with the public confirmed the value of the artist as an important voice of Italian music history. In 2003 she was back in the Sanremo contest with â??Di un Amoreâ?? (was ranked in ninth place), and in 2005 with â??Echi Dâ??Infinitoâ?? which was awarded first prize in the â??Womenâ?? category, and third in overall classification. In 2005, together with both the Chorus S. Ilario Di Rovereto (TN) and the Chorus Valle Dei Laghi di Padergnone (TN) she became the character of the â??Echi dâ??Infinitoâ?? project, a recovery of Alpine pop songs and also of her own songs accompanied only by human voice.

Recently, in addition to the Sanremo Festival where her beautiful songs are performed to the public, she is frequently touring with different kinds of concerts: "Sacrarmonia", a concert dedicated to sacred music of the world; "Tribute to Amalia Rodrigues", a concert committed to the Portuguese fado and its more famous performer, "Four steps for Broadway", a recital devoted to the most popular Broadway musicals (â??Tonightâ??, â??Over The Rainbowâ??, â??Summertimeâ??); and the Stralunato Recital Concert where she performs her most meaningful and famous songs. In 2007 she participated once again in Sanremo with the song "Canzone Fra le Guerre" (written in collaboration with Cristian Carrara), which was ranked in tenth place in the end. During Sanremoâ??s third evening (dedicated to hosts), she performed unaccompanied singing in contest with both the Chorus Valle Dei laghi (TN) and the Chorus S.Ilario (TN).

While maintaining the pop music that made her famous even abroad, Antonella Ruggiero also lends her voice to music of different origins and culture. She has performed many times in English-language countries, including a version of â??Ti Sentoâ?? known in the United Kingdom as â??I Feel Youâ??. On June 4, 2004 she performed a concert in the Brooklyn Museum of New York as a world-wide preview of her CD/DVD entitled â??Sacrarmonia Live (Il Viaggio)â?? with sacred songs of Christian inspiration from several parts of the world. In November 25, 2004 she performed at The Sugar Club in Dublin, accompanied by Mark Harris (Piano), Carlo Cantini (Strings) and Ivan Ciccarelli (Percussions).
