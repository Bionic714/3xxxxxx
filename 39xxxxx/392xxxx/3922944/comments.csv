no description.
no nfo.
but yet there are 28 seeders and 25 peers...

go figure...

Seems to have a couple folders:
/DELL
/HPQ
/IBM

and an executables:
OSCDIMG
BUILD

Anyone know anything? what to do? with these files?"
,todd-h,2007-12-07T00:21Z,"Just run BUILD.CMD or better yet open it in a text editor and see if you can figure out what it does.

If can't figure out what it does then just buy a Mac."
,ir0nw0lf,2007-12-07T00:26Z,"Took a few minutes to scan the .cmd file, but figured it out.  The PID.inf file contains the key.  Installed/setup/activated just fine for me on a actual Dell Poweredge SC420."
,CompTechPro,2007-12-07T06:25Z,"Hey ""todd-h"" thanks for the upload. -BUT- next time include instructions and don't be so ignorant as far as to say: ""if you can't figure it out, buy a Mac""...

IMHO... Macs SUCK!

That is all.."

-Mac"
,todd-h,2007-12-07T07:54Z,I'd like to add another detail about this script. If you create a directory called DRIVERS (at the same level of the brand folders) and place your driver files in it (or 1 additional level of subdirectories) the script will slipstream them.
,Slime_Q_Slimeball,2007-12-07T18:04Z,"Not to crash the party or anything but to use this:
1. copy folder to a drive w/ a couple gigs free
2. choose ""DELL, HPQ, or IBM"" and enter it in the ""set brand="" line 
3. change your DVD drive's letter if it isn't D: on ""set source=""
4. save file
5. insert OEM WHS DVD
6. Double click the script
7. wait for the command box to close and it should have made an ISO in the same folder
8. burn w/ your favorite program

I'm installing this right now and the slipstreamed key wasn't inserted automatically but the key in pid.inf was accepted so... fingers crossed.

this is mostly the same procedure that was outlined by analjuggern4ut for the WHS oem torrent (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3836063/Windows_Home_Server_OEM)"
,todd-h,2007-12-07T21:20Z,"The key in PID.INF is used if you leave the product key blank, that's why I'm replacing that file."
,Slime_Q_Slimeball,2007-12-07T23:02Z,"Maybe I'm doing something wrong here but when the install finishes, it says the key is incorrect and still wants to activate with a valid one. I tried putting the key in manually the first time and did a fresh install without the key and letting the installer do it but the same result...

Pushing the date up to 12/08 trips the mandatory activation upon login.

Does it matter which machine type (dell, hpq, ibm) is chosen? I'm installing on an old HP pavilion 2.8ghz p4."
,todd-h,2007-12-09T22:32Z,"Yes it does matter. The HPQ option will only work if your BIOS has the string ""Hewlett-Packard"". Some Pavilions used the string ""HP PAVILION"" instead. The symptoms you describe are what happens when you install on the wrong brand."
,Slime_Q_Slimeball,2007-12-10T15:09Z,"I just used flash867.exe to dump my bios and I'm going to change the BIOS string with a hex editor in a couple hours when I have more time. I'll either corrupt the BIOS or be able to install WHS.

Right now, if I open it quick in Notepad and search for ""hp pavillion"" the string shows up with lots of white space to the right... hopefully I can swap this and make it work."
,todd-h,2007-12-11T06:55Z,"Just use dmicfg. Also you don't need to reinstall, once you've modded the BIOS it will be activated on the next boot."
,Slime_Q_Slimeball,2007-12-12T15:33Z,"meh... i got tired of screwing with the bios and dmicfg corrupted the DMI information on my bios and then it (dmicfg) refused to load after that - even with a bios reload.

i just gave in and bought the fucking thing... it'll be here tomorrow. 

not to get moralistic but i have a WHS server running and have been using it at home since the beta program started - i figured it was ""time to pay up"". i wish i didn't have to spend $180 for fucking storage pooling, which is really the only feature I use. 

i bought it through my employer so it's really no skin off my nose. :)"
,ezcheeze,2008-02-02T01:21Z,"How can I use the Dmicfg.exe tool to change my BIOS string to be correct? 

I'm using an older Compaq but usually it works with HP OEM installs.  How can I verify that this should work with it?"
,todd-h,2008-02-08T08:53Z,"It depends how old it is. If it was built after the merger and has the string ""Hewlett-Packard"" anywhere in segment F000 if should work. If it was build before the merger it needs to have the string ""COMPAQ"" at F000:FFEA."
,ezcheeze,2008-02-08T21:58Z,"Thanks todd-h

Not sure how to use dmicfg

should I change COMPAQ to Hewlett-Packard?"
,XweAponX,2008-06-30T22:03Z,"I am taking this to mean that it only works for Dell, IBM or HPQ?

I'll try it anyway, it does nto hurt to download ALL of the Activators, one of them usually works."
,todd-h,2008-07-18T04:56Z,There are a few problems with the script. I expect to release a modified version soon.
,XweAponX,2008-07-18T06:12Z,"Hey, you know of any Time-Bomb like TweakNT 1.21 that totally destroyes the Eval 120 Time Bomb on these things?

I have TweakNT 1.21 which works great for a Windows x64 120 eval version that MS mailed to me for free... I got this one sent to me for free too, usually these eval versions are 10 times more solid than the actual releases, so I prefer them actually.

I don't know where to look and it took me about a year to finally find the TweakNT that worked for my XP 64"
,todd-h,2008-07-19T01:01Z,I've updated this script. The updated version can be found at: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4303557/Windows_Home_Server_OEM_Activator_V2
