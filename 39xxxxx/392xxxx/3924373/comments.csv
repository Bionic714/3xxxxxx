,GarminClaus,2007-12-07T06:02Z,"Its only 245k in size because I didn't post the data with it.  The data is available everywhere... The keygen was only available by going to forums and posts in forums never usually last.  I've run the keygen myself.  The reason it doesn't work for everyone is because it is broken.  It will work for some, and that's great.  I've never made a dime selling unlocks.  I used to hose BlueBeaver by giving away unlock codes.  I don't believe in selling unlocks, or just giving away keygens.  I'd personally rather people help out the open source mapping efforts so that the data is freely available to all.  Besides, Tom Tom just bought Navteq recently... Garmin's map supplier.  How long do you think it will be before map prices REALLY go up, or before updates dry up.

At any rate, until open source map data is completely available, I'll have to stick with Navteq, so having a broken keygen running around is just fine.  If it works for the XT stuff, great.  I hear it doesn't work for Mapsource yet.  That's kind of a nuisance.  I have checked the keys it generates, so I do know what's wrong with them... I don't know why they aren't right.  Maybe the XT does things differently.  Garmin has at least two sets of tables already.  Older Units won't benefit at all from this keygen.  But those of you with XT phone units are probably in luck.  Provided your unit ids aren't even.

If you've posted the most ""up-to-date"" keygen here, great.  As far as I know, its broken too, but I'll try yours and see what results it produces.  Like I said, if it works for you, great.  If it doesn't work for someone, I'll help them get a key that does through the end of December.  I've sent my keys out there, and they worked.  ShareAll even got one from me... and didn't pay a dime for it.  That was back when he was hammering BlueBeaver for trying to start up a Garmin hacking business and I was testing my keys.  I probably took many of his customers because I gave them a free solution.  Back then I also asked that people post garmin map data for keys.  was able to store quite a bit of it, but it just got too massive.  Thanks to those that posted it.  This year I'm just pushing for people to contribute to the open source mapping project.  They could really use your input."
,Jako0101,2007-12-07T12:42Z,"Garmin Claus, 

""This keygen wont work for everybody"", you have stated this repeatedly. And you also say that it does not work on older garmin units. 

My garmin unit is maybe 3 yeras old, and I made it work. Is that old enough for you?


Sainta,

Of course you will find this torrent on other torrent sites. Read one more time why I have posted it here. 

Have a nice day....

,GarminClaus,2007-12-07T14:05Z,"Well, eMap would be considered old.  Its about 8 years old, so no, 3 years probably wouldn't do it."

,GarminClaus,2007-12-07T20:42Z,"I'm going to be pulling my torrent soon anyway.  He probably doesn't share his keygen for the same reason I don't share mine (unless he wants to start up a garmin unlock business :O ), because Garmin will just change the lock.  And I might want to buy a new unit someday :D ...

But if you post a keygen somewhere, then you can expect it to spread (its on rapidshare, and several other sites)... 

Glad to hear he has a repaired keygen that actually works.

Finally, so long BlueBeaver :D ... go buy a map.  Better yet, support open source mapping.

One final thought - with Nokia at the Navteq wheel, how long before Garmin DOES change the unlock scheme?  Buy up those old units now :)  ... They've already changed their unlock code policy (and they have changed the unlock mapping scheme at least once since I've been unlocking units).

Support open source mapping."
,Jako0101,2007-12-07T22:35Z,"halo1981 , 

what do you mean when you say ""it""?

It should work with your Garmin eTrex Vista Cx if the map you are trying to install is compatible with your garmin unit and this keygen. 
For map compability for your unit take a look at www.garmin.com

Good luck!

I will no longer post any message regarding you.

,halo1981,2007-12-08T15:24Z,"Hello Jako, 

It says on the garmin site city navigator NT is compatible with garmin etrex vista cx.

i downloaded city navigator NT from shareall and downloaded jetmouses keygen. For using the keygen i need a card id. I have a 2gb sandisk micro sd card in my garmin etrex vista cx. I installed the programs in the keygen and downloaded as well from garmin site but either of these programs installed on my sd card just starts and quits again immediately. These programs are only necessary to find card id. Ive looked crazy for another program to retrieve my card id but don't seem to find it.  So i think if i can get that card id jetmouses keygen should work...

I downloaded metroguide and metrogold and that works ok but is too big for my memory card. I would like combine with unlocked topo (works ok if only topo) and mapsource doesnt want to upload both of them together (or parts of them).  

Thanks a lot, 

Halo"
,halo1981,2007-12-08T18:14Z,"city navigator works ok now, tried it with the id nr of my gps and it works. 
Still struggling though with combination of topo and City navigator, i cant use img2gps because it's bigger than 1gb an city navigtor doesnt work in mapsource. 

Greets and thanks"
,Jako0101,2007-12-08T18:28Z,"halo1981 , 

I now realize that your only problem is that you can't find your units id number. I dont realy have any experience with your type of garmin unit, but it should not be that difficult. In my garmin unit this is very easy. 

I did not use the programs for retrieving unit id  that comes with this torrent, but I know that you should not putt them on your SD card like you say you do. You are of course suppose to install them on your PC and then connect your garmin unit through usb connection. 

I suggest that you read the manual for your unit and see if it says anything about how to find unit id, you will probably find this on garmins' webpage. You can also try to contact them by email. 

Metroguide (with metrgold)  was not impressing on my garmin nuvi 300. So I suggest that you  try to make it work with City Navigator first.

Once again, good luck."
,Jako0101,2007-12-08T18:31Z,"Ok, it seems that we were writting on same time. 
Of course you should use the id of your garmin unit, I am just glad that it finally worked for you. 
"
,jjng,2007-12-08T21:13Z,"Halo,

Just to be clear on how you got City Navigator Maps onto your eTrex:
(1) You used your unit id from your Garmin eTrex
(2) Entered the unit id into the keygen along with the mapset id and generated the keys
(3) Created your City Navigator Map from MapSource and transfered it to your microSD \Garmin.
(4) You created the two files (mentionned in the solution.txt) that contain the keys from the keygen and also placed them in \Garmin.

I'm trying to get it working on the GPS60Cx with BlueChart maps, but no luck so far.

Thanks

,makattack1,2007-12-09T01:15Z,"Can someone Pls help me understand how to install City Navigtor Middle East on my phone with mobile xt. I am a complete newbie with garmin xt and city navigator. 

So l have downloaded city navigator middle east from the internet and right now the maps are locked and require a 25 digit key. To use the keygen how do i find my unit Id for the mobile xt software on my phone and how do i find my mapset id. 

Also once i have the key generated, how do i transfer the maps onto my device. 

Help with this would be really very much appreciated"
,halo1981,2007-12-09T12:56Z,"here is what i did: 

downloaded city navigator nt 2008 from shareall.

got the unit id of my gps in mapsource: when you try to transfer a map to your gps you have to select  a device and the unit ID is in brackets after the name of your gps. 

the rest is as described guide.txt, so:

I put this in the keygen in the ""card id"" place. push generate and you get the device unlock code. put this in the file sw.unl and copy it to your sd card in directory garmin\

Select custom mapset and nr = 284(for city navigator nt 2008). Push generate to get map unlock code. Put this in a file gmapsupp.unl and copy it to your garmin directory on your sd card. 

then i renamed the file downloaded to gmapsupp.img and copied it to same garmin\ on sd card.  Takes about an hour. 

I copied the files through usb cable and micro sd card in my gps. Select usb mass storage in your gps when connected to pc (then it appears as a usb mass storage unit in windows explorer). 

I disconnected gps and it worked!

Anyone advice on how to put multiple maps bigger than 1gb on your sd card? 
City navigator nt 2008 doesnt work in mapsource and img2gps doesnt support files bigger than 1gb. I would like to combine city navigator  with topo map (this one works ok if installed alone). 

Greetings and good luck, 

Halo"

I am having trouble to complete step 2 in your attached guide in the torrent. Where do I find the ""card id""?  GMXT is that on the computer or on the GPS? (dont really get what it is) I have a garmin nüvi 760.   New to everything about gps....  would appreciate it very much"
,jjng,2007-12-09T17:42Z,"Halo,

Thanks a lot for the info! It sure does clear things up.
I'm using City Navigator NT North America and not Europe, but I'm able to select the maps in MapSource and send to the device.  I installed CityNav using the CNNANT2008Update_ENU.MSI file located in the install directory.  The install asked for a location to place the files, I placed it in C:\Garmin and the installed finished.  The installer placed a MapInstall icon on the desktop and when I opened MapSource it asked for a serial key for CityNavNT North America.  Once I entered it, I was able to transfer the maps onto the microSD card using the ""send to device"" in MapSource.

Thanks again!

,Jako0101,2007-12-10T01:13Z,"carl_aj, 

You and I have similar garmin unit so it is very easy to make it work. 

The only thing you need from this torrent is the keygen, nothing else. Do NOT follow the text ""Guide"". 

Just follow the descreption I wrote above and you will soon find out that is very simpel. 

Good luck!"

,dracpmurt,2007-12-11T11:37Z,"Halo --

Lots of help and useful information from both you and jako. However, I'm having just the worst problems getting this to work with my Etrex Vista HCx. jjing seems to have gotten the (obvious) solution to work via mapsource and the program that mapsource calls (Garmin\UpdateWizard.exe) -- how he did that is beyond me. Grabbed my device ID from the tool in Mapsource, etc etc, no luck.

I've followed the written instructions for the .UWL files, but apparently they don't unlock the maps as far as the Etrex series / Mapsource is concerned.

I used 'DEMO' as the unlock key and checked out the registry, apparently it throws 'DEMO' as a string in HKEY_CURRENT_USER -> Software -> Garmin -> MapSource -> Codes

What are the limitations with the demo mode, anyway? Is this a viable alternative to actually giving the thing a valid unlock code?

I'm certainly at a speed bump; have been working on this for a couple of days now. I'm going for City Navigator North America NT 2008. (Which, by the way, when it installs, does so to a folder called CNNANT2008, with a multitude of numbered .img files, one large(r) file called CNNANT2008_mdr.img, and some other various files of similar naming conventions that end with .tbd, .mdx and .trf)

Any suggestions? Other than contributing to open mapping? (I do this already! I want proprietary goodness!)"
,jdeath,2007-12-11T14:59Z,"Anyone have any luck? I am trying to upload this to a Garmin Streetpilot i2.

NOTE: This keygen is not yet compatible with Garmin MapSource application. To see maps in the MapSource, use the key provided with the map.  To unlock the maps on the PC use: type  VE76V-AXVLW-9CQTA-4ADB8-8DQZ9 into unlock wizard.

1. Get JetMouse Kg v.1.1 http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3924373/Garmin_Keygen__made_by_JetMouse_
2. In Nuvi go to -> Settings -> System -> About -> Unit ID (10 digits or so)
3. Enter the ID in keygen to get Device Code.
4. Select Map Product or Select ""custom mapset"" in keygen and enter 284 to get unlock code for City Navigator Europe NT 2008.

Option 1 - saving mapset on a SD Card
--------------------------------------------------
1. Once you get your Map Unlock Code, save it into a file called GMAPSUPP.UNL (using Notepad)
2. Rename your downloaded gmapprom.img to gmapsupp.img. 
3. Create a directory called Garmin on your the root directory of the SD card
4. Put both GMAPSUPP.IMG and GMAPSUPP.UNL to \Garmin\ directory.
5. Insert the SD Card into the Nuvi and restart GPS unit.

Option 2 - overwriting existing preloaded mapset within the Nuvi
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Once you get your Map Unlock Code , save it into a file called GMAPPROM.UNL (using Notepad)
1. Connect your GPS Unit to the PC and go to \Garmin\ directory.
2. Make a backup copy of your current GMAPPROM.IMG mapset file to some place safe on  your computer.
3. Delete GMAPPROM.IMG mapset file from your GPS unit.
4. Upload the new GMAPPROM.IMG mapset to your GPS unit (same directory) along with GMAPPROM.UNL and restart GPS unit

NOTE: This keygen is not yet compatible with Garmin MapSource application. To see maps in the MapSource, use the key provided with the map.  To unlock the maps on the PC use: type  VE76V-AXVLW-9CQTA-4ADB8-8DQZ9 into unlock wizard.

,dracpmurt,2007-12-14T09:24Z,"Ah, I get it now.

I got things (City Navigator North America NT) working with my Garmin eTrex Vista HCx. This is how:

I got this guy over here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3809600/garmin__city_navigator_north_america_NT_2008

Which is the _update_ DVD. That doesn't affect what we're about to do though, for all intents and purposes, this is the the software we want.

This is to be downloaded, installed on your PC, and you /will/ need to unlock it _IN MAPSOURCE_ using the serial # provided in these comments (I'm too chicken sh1t to post things like that...)

Once you've done this, you can navigate your map on your computer. Select the states in which you are interested in downloading the detailed maps of using the Map Tool within Mapsource. Make sure City Navigator North America NT 2008 is selected in the upper left hand corner of the program's drop down menu.

You should see a list of the states you've selected on the left hand side of the screen. But at any rate, after you get what you want selected, you'll click the button that has a little GPS unit on its side with a down arrow on top of it, if your hold your mouse over it the tooltip should say ""Send To Device."" You're going to want to do this, you're going to want to crack a beer or smoke a bowl or sip your seltzer water, whatever it is you do, because this is going to take a couple of years... data transfer is /not/ true to USB 2.0 speeds.

This should load your maps to the SD card in your device, it did in mine. If you don't have an SD card in your device, go buy one from supermediastore.com or something. They're cheap now. Spend $$$ on your hardware, not your software.

Alright. So after your transfer, brush the cobwebs off of your device and go in to its settings. You're going to want to put it in to ""Mass Storage Mode"" -- just basically uses the thing as a USB key to transfer data to and from the MicroSD card in it.

The maps that you've created in MapSource should be there in all of their one-file-listing-glory called, as the comments before me have suggested, gmapsupp.img. This file will be pretty big, depending on how many states (maps) you selected to transfer to the device.

Now this is where you get to use the keygen. Same rules as the previous comments apply. After you verify the file gmapsupp.img is in /Garmin on the MicroSD card, turn the device off and back on again, plug it up normally and open MapSource to get the device ID. This goes into the keygen, generate your device key and save it to a file called SW.UNL.

Next, generate your map key for whatever map you're using (Again, I'm doing this with City Navigator North America NT 2008) and save it to a file that you're going to name GMAPSUPP.UNL (Case does not matter here. We should all know how to use notepad, or whatever flavor text editor suits your tastes.)

Change your device over to mass storage mode again in its settings, browse to the /Garmin directory and copy the two files we just made over to here.

Enjoy your maps. I sure am. Many thanks to everyone who helped me along the way."
,Stainless1169,2007-12-14T11:35Z,"Hey dracpmurt,

How do you put the 60CSx in ""Mass Storage Mode""?"
,horacehump,2007-12-14T13:21Z,"City Navigator Europe V9 to Garmin 60Csx

Note: The keygen would not produce a working 25 character unlock code for Mapsource so I used a legitimate one I have.

It did produce a working unlock code for my 60Csx


Open Mapsource and create mapset required (my Mapsource is unlocked with a legitimate unlock code)

Put blank MicroSD card in card reader

Save mapset to card

This will create a folder on the card called ?garmin? with a file in it called ?gmapsupp.img? this is the mapset you just created and saved to the card.


Obtain Unit ID
Plug in GPS to PC and switch on GPS, In Mapsource> Utilities>Get unit ID, copy/save given code.

Open Keygen
Paste unit ID in to top field marked ?Enter your unit ID here?
Select City Navigator Europe NT v9 in drop down box 
Click upper ?Generate? button
Copy/save 25 character code generated

Create bank txt file (right click on PC desktop and select >new>text document)

Open document and paste in it the 25 charter code, nothing more.

Name file created ?gmapsupp.unl?

Copy file and save to the MicroSD card in the garmin folder with ?gmapsupp.img?

You should now have in the garmin folder two items
gmapsupp.img & gmapsupp.unl

Put card in GPS, switch on, 

Please report back if this works for you or any comments please"

,kazafog,2007-12-16T08:21Z, hey has anyone tried loading multiple maps using this fantastic keygen.  Everything i read says that mapsource can send multiple maps to the gps even though it can not display it.  I'm just wondering if the extremely smart lads that came up with this keygen know what happens with two or more maps.  For instance i have city nav v7 australia and blue chart pacific v9.5 and would like to have all info at once.  therefore i could drive to a fishing spot and boat to it and have all the detail necessary.  i presume you probably require another 'gmapsupp.unl' and 'sw.unl' file or maybe just other unlock codes saved in the files.  Unfortunately i don't have my gps as yet i just ordered a 60csX yesterday.  Thanks again to the clever people that came up with this.

,ChazInMT,2007-12-29T00:43Z,"Hey everyone, I have a Street Pilot c330 and was having a terrible time trying to get Europe NT 2008 (Map ID 284) to run on a 2GB SD card. You need a 2GB card cause Europe NT 2008 is 1.4 GB in size.

The Unit ID which you access through ""system/about"" on the touch screen of the GPS unit is WORTHLESS if you're trying to get the GPS unit to read the map on an SD card.

It turns out you need the SD Internal Serial Number in order to unlock the maps!! The serial number printed on the outside, if you find it, is worthless. If you look for how to get the SD's Internal Serial online, it is daunting, you need some high powered custom software to hack this out of the card. However, Garmin has made it easy for us!!!

Just put the SD card into the c330, acknowledge that it doesn't work...(YET!), then press and hold the top right of the screen for maybe 10 seconds to access the ""Service Menus"", scroll over to the menu ""Data Card Test Page"" it contains the SD card info on it and the SD Serial is printed right there. It is a 10 digit number. This SD ID is the number you need to enter into the JetMouse KG as the ""Unit ID"" along with your Map ID. I couldn't figure out how to leave the ""Service Mode"" on my c330 so I did a ""Gross Reset"" by shutting it off, when it restarts it's back to it's normal simple self. 

Now, I put the ""Device Code"" into an SW.unl file and the ""Map Code"" into a GMAPSUPP.unl file. I have these files in a Garmin directory on my SD card along with the GMAPSUPP.img file, when I put this SD card into my Street Pilot c330, it Fookin Works Great!!!! I don't know if it needed the Device Code in the SW.unl file or not, I got it to work with the SW file in there and I ain't gonna experiment now by removing it just to see what happens.

I have Done it! Not guessing anymore! I can see street level details in Berlin and Chicago both. Life is Good!

Can't guarantee this will work with anything else, but if you're having trouble trying to get this to work otherwise, it's worth a shot!

All you guy's out there helping, try to refer users to this post if they can't seem to get their units to work.

I used the 010 editor though as it took too long to open the file using other editors. I used the unlocked MapSource to transfer the maps to my GPS. I loaded the whole map. Once done, I moved the microSD card to a reader, then open the gmapsupp.img file using the 010 editor. CTRL-F to find the unlock string used (i just searched for the first 5 chars just in case they do not store the dashes). It took a bit of time to run until it found the unlock string (and it didn't have the dashes). Replaced it with the unlock string from the keygen, and VOILA!"

is there a way to do this on a Mac without using mapsource?  Also jetmouse's instructions seem that they are for a mobile device.
any help you can give?

,mickey1971,2008-01-27T12:56Z,"I am new to this, so I have a question.  I actually have a legitimate DVD of the City Navigator NT North America v8 (Garmin used to mail out the DVDs for free and then charge you like $60 for the unlock code), so I just need an unlock code.  I have a Garmin StreetPilot 7200.  I am wondering if I can skip the downloads in step 1 since I have the DVD.  Also, do I need to use an SD card to get this keygen process to work?  Because the codes from the keygen aren't working for me.  Did I miss a step?  Thanks in advance for your help."
,mickey1971,2008-01-27T13:35Z,"Sorry about this second post, but I have some additional information.  I went to the link you provided in your original post and found a key that appeared to work.  I entered the key and it allowed me to continue.  Then, it told me to attach my unit and turn it on, which I did.  When I clicked the update link in the software, it says ""The map update on the Garmin GPS has failed.""  Then I got another message that said ""You do not have a vaild unlock code for the maps being sent to your GPS"".  From these messages, I am guessing that the key that I entered only unlocked the MapSource software that I installed on my computer from the DVD rather than umlocking the actual City Navigator software.  Can you help me please?  I am really frustrated with this!"
