,OrpheusDude,2011-02-20T02:34Z,"Dude!  You include 20 minutes of DVD bonus material, some of which is very interesting, particularly the scene-by-scene differences between the pre-release and initial release versions of the movie BUT THERE IS NO AUDIO!!!!  Can you possibly correct this?  I'd really love to have those extras!"
