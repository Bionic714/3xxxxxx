Or maybe it's some special format?"

,JJCHM,2012-05-30T14:36Z,"The Gekisai Dai video is indeed recorded using a different codec than the rest. If anybody else has the same problem, this tip helped me:

open a 'command prompt' using a rightclick, select, 'Run as Administrtor'
type: cd C:WindowsSysWOW64 (32bit users can skip this step) - press enter
type: regsvr32 ir50_32.dll - press enter

to undo what you have done, type: regsvr32 /u ir50_32.dll
there is an error during unregistration, but it does remove it from being active"
