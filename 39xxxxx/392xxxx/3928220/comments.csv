,jonnti,2008-11-14T16:57Z,"If you are using Daemon tools do like this:

1. Download the Torrent.

2. Open daemon tools.

3. Right Click on the icon for Daemon tools and click Virtuell CD/DVD ROM, then you can see ""Unit [F], [G]"" etc.
click on one of them who are empty and click on mount ISO file, then find the ISO files and mount them.

4. Open ""My Computer"" and click on the ""Install_Disc.ISO"" and install it.

5. When you have completed the installation you should open ""My Computer"" again and click on the second image ""Play_Disc.ISO"".

6. PLAY!"

,Emplehod,2009-06-01T03:24Z,"@ mrtester123

You can't play most cracked games online except via Direct IP or using something like Hamachi, then it is usually with people you know."
,Emplehod,2009-06-01T03:30Z,"@ shadowdark

RAR is an archiving format, similar to ZIP, 7Z, LZH, etc.  It is a compressed format usually containing many different files.  You need to extract the RAR first.

There is a totally free suite of tools from ALTools available with a RAR utility, video player, FTP client, etc. from:

,TheBrazenHead,2009-08-18T00:31Z,"jonnti, 

I want to play this off of my computer so I am using your step by step instructions but I am stuck on #4.

It starts to install it but then before the last couple green bars are complete a pop up box appears and states ""Setup needs the next disc"", ""Please insert the following disc: Play Disc"".

I can't seem to locate the Play Disc when browsing my c:/

A window pops up:

""Setup cannot find a file on a specific path or disk, please check that the proper disk is inserted or specify a new file path.

What am I missing?  Please help.

TBH"
,TheBrazenHead,2009-08-18T01:01Z,"Nevermind, I figured it out.

Thanks for the upload!  I got bored of Risk!  :)  "
