,darehardi,2007-12-10T06:29Z,does this work on x32 ?
,Svenstaro,2007-12-16T01:56Z,Works well.
,project6,2008-01-16T23:48Z,The keygen is not a virus. Your firewall is probably set to delete inappropriate files such as keygenerators and cracked .exe files.
,BBQAB,2008-02-17T19:23Z,"How about a x86 version, is there any out yet?"
,spidertim,2008-03-22T00:34Z,"svenstaro don't lie, this version doesn't work on x32..."
,spidertim,2008-03-22T00:36Z,anyone has vray 1.5 rc4x32 or vray 1.5 sp1 for 3dsmax 2008
,Draelren,2008-04-04T19:25Z,"When will anyone upload a good x86 version of this? Which is what people mean when they say x32, not realizing x32 is nothing, and x86 means 32 bit processors. 

I'm being held up until I can get my computer with max 08 able to render as well. "
,nicedice,2008-04-09T11:36Z,cant get this to work - fails on install. any hints? where do i choose the folders to install into etc.
,Wagner24,2008-05-03T14:12Z,"If running Vista, run as an admin.  If running Avg uninstall it, this keymaker has a trojan.  If you have never worked with a throw away key don't bother.  Otherwise set it up, remove the key, reinstall avg.  I have major anti-viris if it gets through all 3 I quit.  You only need the keymaker 1 time."
,IvanDuke,2008-06-15T17:07Z,"It really works with Max 2008!! There are trojans or viruses in it (using the latest NOD32) :)

Thanks for the up!"
,project6,2008-06-17T19:49Z,"The keygen is NOT a virus/trojan. It uses a similar behaviour, like most keygenerators, that's why antivirus triggers on it. It's safe to use."
,Wagner24,2008-06-28T19:16Z,Avg is the only one that doesn't like  the keygen.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with it like project 6 said.  For some reason about 6 months ago avg started sending all keygens to the viris bank.  I had this same one for almost a year before it started giving me grief.  NO harm..
,hITOz,2008-10-16T17:32Z,i was here!
,Draelren,2008-10-27T07:09Z,x86 version coming? 32 bit systems are still out here...
,sp33dygtx,2009-02-05T07:49Z,IS NOT WORKING .. wHAT SHOULD I REPLACE?
,h4rl3qu1n,2010-02-03T15:01Z,You would want the SP4 and not the RC4 for 3ds Max 2010. This SP4 was uploaded 2007-12-05.
,freeforlife,2010-06-24T15:05Z,"Works fine in max 2008,thanks."
