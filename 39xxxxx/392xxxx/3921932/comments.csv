,TaxiTitan,2008-02-11T15:58Z,please seed this anyone.
,TaxiTitan,2008-02-17T08:00Z,"opensubtitles dot org has eng subs for the dvdrip version that also works with this one.
Ive watched the 1st episode in 720p with subs.

the bitrate was poor but looks good if you use coreavc with deblocking and 0-255 input.

I wanna watch the rest in 720p.
please seed the rest.
I have 72.5% complete"
