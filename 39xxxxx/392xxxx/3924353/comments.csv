[V],Lindoff41,2007-12-07T08:44Z,"Mork_26: Jag hoppas du förstår min svenska (är dålig på engelska) Du kan om du vill ta ner filerna en och en. Ta ner torrenten, klicka på den så att den öppnar sig, avmarkera och markera sedan vilken fil du vill ladda ner."

not that im complaining or anything but isent this going a bit slow.. i have only downloaded 2 gb total.. dont get me wrong i dont mind the upload and i get the film when it is down so no negativity here :-) just wondering "
[T],wormman,2007-12-12T13:22Z,"I understand you Mork_26. The Availability right now is 10.999, and (one) of the  problem with slow download speed is to slow upload speed from you or the other dowloaders.  We all have to remember that this is ""file sharing"" not ""file taking""."
,Mork_26,2007-12-12T13:26Z,im seeding with a 1 mbit upload.. so i think that im giving something back

,V4Friend,2008-01-24T17:19Z,"A question for all you fellow Trekfans: does anyone have Disc 6 from season 6 of Star Trek Deep Space 9?

The torrent that is present on the Pirate Bay is dead (it's stuck at 98% and has been for 3 weeks :-(

We (30 of us) would appreciate it very much if anyone would reseed or re-upload this DVD (if possible: the DVD content i.e. VIDEO_TS folder).

Thanks in advance!
"

,kovvan,2008-02-18T16:04Z,"How do I burn this? I tried Nero and MagicIso, but it seems the file is too big for my DVD-discs. 7gig, do I have to convert it or something? 

Very thankful for answers."
,V4Friend,2008-02-18T21:12Z,Try a double layer DVD ;-)
,levdr,2008-03-11T10:56Z,"Right, I have finally finished my download only to find that half of the iso files are damaged in some way and will not play. "

,dkfy77,2008-08-30T09:38Z,"great work !!! very good series,but why no greek subtitle?can you help ???"
,foreverflash,2009-07-07T23:16Z,"I see that in the torrent details the format is listed as PAL, but can you verify this wormman? I live in Eastern USA and I can't play PAL on my xbox 360.

Is this also NTSC or can it be converted into such?"
