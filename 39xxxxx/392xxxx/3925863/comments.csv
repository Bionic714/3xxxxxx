,BRB-BBS,2007-12-08T12:57Z,"I know.
It is resleased  by M$ in 2007.
Not tested it so much yet, but it looks like ERD commander 5.0 with some minor Vista adjustments.
It works.
Uploaded as I found it on the net."
,jmillay,2007-12-22T17:24Z,Everyone downloading this but leaving no comment.  I have use this before and yours works great.  Good job.
,sukidesu,2008-01-17T23:46Z,"I can't get it to work with my Vista Home Premium machine...any ideas? It says at logon ""Unsupported OS"", even though it knows it's Vista Home Premium...?"
,fabribek,2008-01-28T15:37Z,"Does this have Winternals Defrag Manager?
I just want that program...."
,webShock,2008-02-04T13:50Z,"what is this? There is no such thing as ERD Commander 2007 as M$ has assimilated this prog (yes, very borg-like) into something bigger (probably a technet product)

I would really take heed in using this to recover something as there is no such thing as ERD 2007"
,coppermine20,2008-02-09T12:34Z,does this have crash analyzer? coz the crash analyer in erd commander 2005 doesnt work coz it needs a licence.
,SamuraiX11,2008-02-21T09:54Z,"Not sure at 100% but seems like this version broken. Its smaller by size than 2005, and constantly reboots on mashine, where I tried it. ERD 2005 works there flawlessly, so..."
,albama,2008-09-14T13:06Z,"thx a lot for this program, i try it on win xp"
,LeSet,2009-01-02T12:31Z,"Best fucking program by a longshot, i work as a deejay and most of my files on my old crashed computer was locked, and ERD fixed it, i made a backup of everything and now i'm very happy.

Merry new year!

,rocketero,2010-02-08T23:13Z,"To anyone using erd commander I find out that this is a great software, but compared to the Windows-PE-builder software (called Winbuilder) is not that great after all.

I just built a Windows7 PE (Boot-able Windows 7 with Many Tools) using Winbuilder-078-SP6, just google it and you'll see what this is.

You can have this bootable cd (after building it takes around 350 to 400 MB space), with network support and tools like disk imaging, antivirus, antispyware, Internet, and much more.

Just take a look at screenshot I took:

as this is a CD, you can make as many changes while working with it and once is shutdown no changes are made to your apps or tools.

Hope this helps, Winbuilder has a forum with many users eager to help you.

they have builds for LiveXP, VistaPE, Win7PE, BartPE and a few others.
regards."
