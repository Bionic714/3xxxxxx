,Zykure,2008-06-23T18:17Z,"MP3? You mean this obsolete format for audio data? Since OGG is better than MP3 in almost all cases, I use OGG for new cd rips.

btw,  ""NEXT TIME MAKE SURE"" you (a) buy the CD (b) get a cd ripper (c) rip the cd to your preferred format and (d)  don't whine about the lower quality or the bigger files that are wasting your disk space ;)

And now for something completely different...
If you don't like it, just don't download it, okay?"
