,topher27,2007-12-16T23:59Z,"Cams are only bad quality when the person camming them doesn't know what they are doing. I've seen some people take really good cams, and pretty much any 300$ or so camera can make some pretty good cams. people forget to turn off all the extra processing features in cameras which can lead to blurry, out of focus films, with faded coloring. cams extra features are for the 3d world, not a 2d screen. I've seen quite a few cams where it focus's in and out automatically, which doesn't help with picture quality or compression.

the bad thing about the cam scene is that they are more worried about getting it out ASAP than they are with the quality of their recording. they only care about being labeled as 'cool' and being praised for their backward efforts, when with just a bit of knowledge and effort, they could put out very decent cams. decent cams exist, we all know it, we've all seen it, and it doesn't take expensive hardware to do. sure these people took the risk so everyone else can watch the movie to, but why risk yourself for such a low quality film that won't even be liked.

cams like this are what ruins movies for the impatient, because the quality is so bad they end up watching a dvdrip, and of course by then they've already seen the movie, which makes it less enjoyable even with higher quality. so please, if you want to put out cams, do it right. it is possible, and it isn't hard. I AM ungrateful for these peoples efforts. I'm tired of seeing people defend crappy quality cams, because without people pushing the envelope, they won't bother to put the extra effort into a decent cam.

I challenge all bootleggers to come out with decent cams, prove me wrong and make everything right, give us some decent cams.

and don't give me that 'well if you can do better...' crap. I can do many things better than other people, doesn't mean I have to actually do it. and it doesn't mean that I can't criticize. it is funny how people love to hear positive feedback about their work, but when someone gives them the truth that is blunt and not sugar coated, they act like you've done something unspeakable. grow up. deal with it."
,Pyatin,2007-12-17T10:30Z,"Private viewing and viewing rooms are also a trick of the trade.  Until I moved, I used to do nice cams.  Now there isn't a theater nearby for me to do it.  You want to be cool with movie cams, get good quality from a private viewing session.  

If you want to be cool with the cams, get a private viewing session."
,Zombster,2007-12-17T16:28Z,"Well, unless you have a serious post-production, you´ll never be able to provide your audience with good quality. 
The conversion of the 24 fps (cinema) to the 25 fps (digital cam) will always lead to blurry pans. You´ll also have problems getting the colours right, if you start your recording in the darkness of a movies theatre. And the laughter/screams of the audience will probably mess up the audio.
If you enjoy watching movies in a private viewing session at your favorite theatre (and that sounds like a real joy), then let others have the chance to enjoy it as well, by uploading the real stuff not cam-crap."

,cybergen,2008-01-05T18:54Z,"If it wasn't for the risks that people take filming with their cams, everyone would have to wait a lot longer to see all these new releases, yes some cam jobs are better than others, there are so many different contributing factors to the quality of a cam job outside of the control of the person risking their arse filming it. They can't exactly set up a tripod, get the audience to strategicaly position themselves, so as not to get in the way or keep them quiet so as not to spoil the audio can they. Big respect to the risk takers who bring us these new releases, regardless of quality."

,projektdeth,2008-01-08T05:55Z,"I can't believe this is still in the top 100 with this type of quality.  Download at your own risk.  Not worth the hard-drive space.  Quality is terrible.

V=2.5/10
A=2.5/10

We would be better off if people didn't upload this junk."
