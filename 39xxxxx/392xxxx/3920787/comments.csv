I wil seed 10x when it completes :)"
,Ozintaos,2007-12-14T18:37Z,Network  wont allow bandwidth to seed two seasons at once. When someone has all S1 and seeds I will move on
,Ozintaos,2007-12-15T02:50Z,S2 now seeding...2 Seeders...sould be faster than S1 :-)
,Ozintaos,2007-12-15T07:00Z,"S2 running well most ""peers"" at 75+% We may be done before the weekend is over.....If we see seeds for 2 and peers for 3 at 80-90% season 4 will start in the morning. "
