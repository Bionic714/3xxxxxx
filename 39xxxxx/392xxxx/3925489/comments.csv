,JohnTheMutt,2008-01-07T06:20Z,"LOL! :) I remember seeing this movie in the drive-in for the 1st time way back when it first came out in San Diego. A friend and I were walking through the cars to the concession stand when the orgy seen came on and you heard all the mothers screaming and putting their hands over their childrens eyes. I guess that they thought it was a ""Flash Gordon"" movie and whole families went. Most drive-ins pulled it right away but some stilled showed it for quite a while!! ROFLMAO...the 70's what a funny decade...:)"
