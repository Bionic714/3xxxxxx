,skoumoun,2007-12-07T19:38Z,"everyone should know that there is apparently a few video glitches during the movie.

A proper might be released."
,stateofdreaming,2007-12-08T08:03Z,"Shitty, I guess I'll wait unless sailo says otherwise. "
,stateofdreaming,2007-12-09T06:15Z,"Dude, if you post a torrent at least seed it. Please."
[V],sailo,2007-12-09T11:58Z,"been away, line was disconnected.

3 very minor video glitches reported by a few, out of 750 that snatched it from HDBits so far.
timecodes:
30:06
51:45
1:00:39

so if you're after a 100% perfect copy, this is not it. 
But if you can live with 1 second of 3 different glitches out of 1:57:38, this is a great copy."
,stateofdreaming,2007-12-10T03:21Z,I've lived with worse. Looks to be ever so slightly better video quality than the other copy upped on demonoid. The audio is definitely better.
,ihorses,2007-12-13T02:04Z,"Demonoid? I thought demonoid is down? Let me check...
Yep, still down, unless I missing something?"
,stateofdreaming,2007-12-13T15:28Z,"upped=past tense, as in the file was upped not currently being upped, as opposed to upping=present tense"
,scumnutz,2007-12-14T05:24Z,is this the new releasse FINAL CUT with new ending?
,petgru,2007-12-15T19:10Z,Could someone please seed. I've uploaded almost 30 GB of this and still I've only been able to download 88% of it.
,stateofdreaming,2007-12-16T04:16Z,There's no use asking for more seeding. Sailo seems to have a really slow connection or only comes on for brief periods to seed. You'll just have to be patient.
,stateofdreaming,2007-12-16T04:24Z,"And actually this way of seeding is probably better than simply superseeding to a few in hopes they don't hit and run. This way assures everyone gets the file, eventually."
,Kuvvet,2007-12-19T21:42Z,where can i finde hd-dvd image? so i can burn to a hddvd dvd? any 1?

,walakiaki,2008-01-02T14:21Z,"Sajnos akad benne két három helyen egy-egy tömörítési hiba. Mármint kikockásodik a kép egy pillanatra.
De azért köszi!"
,8x8,2008-01-02T14:22Z,"First, Thanks 4 the uploader!
Then.. I am not familiar with matroska (my comp says this is .mkv) ,  and x264.. so is there any easy way to make dvd out of this release??? I tried total video converter and tmpgenc but both do something wrong or leave something out...."
,8x8,2008-01-04T13:50Z,AArgh to hell with .mkv and x264 and all who invented those....
,plau,2008-01-10T13:44Z,Anyone else having problems with the sound? Only commentary sounds work:( Before all others hd and   mkv files have been working... Did download two times this torrent... Looks like that I have to DL another version.
,plau,2008-01-10T13:56Z,"Solved the problem, looks like KMPlayer doesn't like  this file, with Media Player did work but now subtitles doesn't work, very weird."
,plau,2008-01-10T20:35Z,Problems solved again:D Working now:) First time had to change option things from SetCenter in final codecs pack....
,Rynier,2008-02-04T12:39Z,"woah thanks dude, there are like 10 different subs in it and other audio tracks, i love you.. :D"

,maxkill,2008-03-12T18:19Z,Can't believe how much trouble I've had with this backround sound.. always used the gom cause vlc wouldn't play sound normally ;D
,kokaiinum,2008-03-21T23:28Z,My god this shit goes slow 3-7Kbs
,Tenche,2008-03-29T22:31Z,"Not worth the download unless you want to watch it on your computer. It wont burn with convertxtodvd it just crashes the program. 
Looks great tho :P"
,ceriale,2008-04-05T00:44Z,"@Tenche
I've had succes with running large (>4,6 gb) DVD files through dvdshrink. This compresses the file to norman 4,6 gb discs. Sure the picture will suffer a tiny bit, but imho its virtually unnoticable. "
,maxkill,2008-04-09T17:30Z,it worked great from my comp..! 
,blackhog42,2008-04-27T13:13Z,perfect quality!!! thanks so much!!
,got_me_our_urs,2008-05-19T19:50Z,"Downloading very speedy, will def. seed this."
,krbo,2008-05-20T01:08Z,"beware , there is a REPACK version !!!

I have a sound problem with this one.

Damned incompetent groups !"
,skadeb87,2008-06-03T23:22Z,not 720p but still really good video and sound! DTS!
,maxkill,2008-06-13T23:20Z,this is beautiful to watch
,xanderxine,2008-07-16T00:44Z,"To all those crying pricks on here...

This is an MKV container for an AVCHD movie file!!! not a DIVX or a DVD you fuckwitted wankstains!!

you can play this on your PC if you grab any MKV codecs or download ""SMPLAYER"" free (google it) or if you are intelligent enough to have purchased a Blu-Ray player/ps3 you can grab a copy of the free app ""ts-muxer"" and convert it back to a Blu-Ray movie that will fit on a standard DVD and play on any Blu-Ray player/ps3 so you dont even need a Blu-Ray writer to do it!!!"
,3261dan,2008-08-21T16:42Z,"xanderxine, whos cryin'?  

 Anyway.. AWESOME, thnaks for a HD version of this awesome film....."
,nonamedood,2008-09-06T16:13Z,This is fucking rarred shit. Why the fuck do you fucking assholes do this fucking shit? You are a fucking idiot!
,s3x.m4ch1n3,2008-10-03T09:44Z,"if you want to use a good mkv/avi to dvd use dvd flick. easy to use and it's fast.

throw that shit ass convertxtodvd in the recycle bin!!"
,s3x.m4ch1n3,2008-10-03T09:46Z,"rar?
you call mkv a rar-file?
i guees u call avi a rar file too ?
do a wiki search before u start typing nonsens."
,souti2006,2008-10-07T07:35Z,Thanks for this release.
,Genewitch,2009-01-06T05:17Z,"yeah this is 1080i (540p)

But still, better than dvd (which is 480i/p, depending on if you have a progressive scan TV and player)"
,bitnode,2009-03-30T16:57Z,Damn. Very nice rip. Better than dvd quality from what I can tell. 
,elektronik_supersonik,2010-06-22T07:44Z,"Time to correct some misinformation:

Though the vertical resolution is ""only"" 532 pixels, this is considered 720p, because there are enough pixels to fill a native 720p screen  horizontally. Increasing vertical resolution would only mess up the aspect ratio.

1080i means two sets of 540p fields (odd lines and even lines) per frame. PAL 1080i is 50 fields per second, while PAL 1080p is 25 FPS. Interlacing was originally intended to reduce flicker on the now-obsolete Cathode Ray Tube displays.

By the way, nice upload! Good to finally see a release that subtitles are part of :)"
,simanic,2011-01-02T13:01Z,this is not worth downloading guys.....the effort is good but the end result is not
