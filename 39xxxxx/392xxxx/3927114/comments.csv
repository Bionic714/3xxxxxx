Any preactivated copy from the manufacturing like DELL, IBM, etc .... will not be reversible i.e it's genuine so any service pack that try to alter this activation scheme will run the risk of deactivating millions of existing copies of Vista already on the market and you know Bill Gates is a smart guy"
,arthurz,2007-12-09T10:20Z,"Thanks!

So what we need to do is just install it and we can use the windows update as well? Can we install the sp1 without applying any crack?"
,coolvince981,2007-12-09T13:53Z,I have been running this copy for several months now and the only updates i had problem with was the language packs which i don't need anyway. I always use nero to burn ISO but you should be able to use and dvd writing software. MagicISO will work also.

Make sure all files requied for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error code: 0x80070450"". I burned the image with nero, no errors during the burning proces. Anyone can help me out ?"
,noos,2008-01-02T08:22Z,"I too can confirm that this works and updates fine.
Did a fresh install two weeks ago on my 3-4 year old Inspiron 8600, updates all work. 
Thanks for this! Happy new year an' shit "
,felz,2008-01-16T08:44Z,"this is not real oem, just cracked to look like dell oem using vista bootloader."
,XSYLUS,2008-03-04T23:35Z,"You can remove DELL logos.  It's stored in C:\Windows\System32\oobe\
"
,kennyl10,2008-06-22T18:52Z,we needs a seeder or two thx....
,cgvgw,2008-07-23T07:23Z,"Felz

Your right.  I am using this on a Dell, an older D600, and its activated right up to the service pack 1 install, then prompts you to activate.

Works up to that point though."
,marflo,2009-04-01T19:41Z,"Hi,
I tested on dell dimension 4300.
Works flawless but it's starts like ubuntu with some cmd lines.
Takes all updates.
It is not worh for my sistem because is working like XP.Veru slow.
I like the chess game you can play what level you like can do upturn to study different options.
I will test on my laptop after my windows 7 ultimate will expire.Btw do you know whether or not I can override the expiration on august.Version 7022.
It is so fast in comparison with the vista home basic that came with laptop.I never got stuck or freeze.

,marflo,2009-04-25T18:22Z,"Hey,today vista got crazy, told me to go on microsoft site because found some exploit that override windows activation than when I told to find whether or not is genuine got ok.
Any ideas what happened, or why was happening?"
