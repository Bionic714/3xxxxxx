Franz Joseph Haydn 1732-1809

Theresienmesse, Hob.XXII-12 - Missa in tempore belli, Hob.XXII-9 'Paukenmesse'

(CD3/3)

with  Brindley Sherratt,  Topi Lehtipuu,  Sara Mingardo,  Joanne Lunn,

English Baroque Soloists

Conducted by John Eliot Gardiner 

The Theresienmesse,is an intimate piece, with clarinets to soften the scoring and extended roles for the soloists. 

Eliot Gardiner brings his usual refreshingly astringent approach to these works, driving the music hard and pushing his singers to clarify every nuance. The result will sound a little acerbic for some ears, especially those not yet accustomed to period performance, but there's no doubting the conductor's commitment to seeking out the very heart of this repertoire
The band, choir, and soloists are impeccable, of course. 

The Paukenmesse, also known as the "Mass in Time of War" was composed when the Napoleonic War was at its peak; Haydn's wild use of tympani in the Agnus Dei movement and the trumpets and drums elsewhere are a sort-of Viennese answer to the menace.Both are wonderfully symphonic. Gardiner and his period-instrument band, soloists, and chorus approach both works head on, with great energy and ideal voice-instrument balance.These are the versions of these masses which should be in your collection.
