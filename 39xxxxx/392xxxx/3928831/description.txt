    Tidal waves, tsunamis and earthquakes are often triggered by the eruption 
    of underwater volcanoes. Such eruptions were the probable cause of past 
    tragedies and are still as destructive today. But now scientists know about 
    the presence of active underwater volcanoes, and are studying ways to 
    predict their behaviour in order to prevent future tragedies on a grand 
    scale. Far from the Indonesian coast that was recently devastated by a 
    tsunami, the coastline of Sicily is alive with many active volcanoes, not 
    all of which are on dry land.
