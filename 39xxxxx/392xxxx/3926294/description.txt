In Pursuit Force: Extreme Justice, the gangs, hoodlums and ruffians of Capital City are out of control. Needless to say, it's up to you to, literally, drive them out of town. However, that's trickier than it sounds, thanks to the introduction of new gangs specialising in their own forms of chaos. Plus, you've now got to deal with a rival squad of "heavy-handed" police called the Viper division. Thankfully, you've got a string of vehicles at your disposal and can leap between planes, hovercraft, jet skis, tanks, trains and helicopters in your pursuit of justice. Other new features include a a "Justice Bar" that helps you to regain strength and prolong missions and a four-player wireless mode for multiplayer pursuits.
