,Cvalin,2007-12-07T06:53Z,"I really hope we keep hearing that every week!

Just know, that if you leave, the e-comic viewers across the world will be devastated, and the kingdom of torrenting comics will forever be in ruins.

Thanks for all the comics you ever provided."
,Deznaj,2007-12-07T10:19Z,"Don't overreact Cvalin, there's always the (much superior) DCP-pack that still comes out twice a week. Now if THAT stops, we e-comic fans will have a real problem!"
,Deznaj,2007-12-07T10:21Z,"But of course, thanks for all the trouble!"
,gaajiin,2007-12-07T19:10Z,"I'll just give my deeply felt ""thank you"" and hope you change your mind man."

That depends. If you're a Windows user, then CDisplay works quite nicely.
