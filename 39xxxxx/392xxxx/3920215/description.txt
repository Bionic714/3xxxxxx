Located in the northernmost part of Alaska, the town of Barrow 
experiences a complete lack of sunshine for an entire month 
once a year. The town is populated with tough, hardworking, and 
generally law-abiding citizens, so there hasnâ??t been much for 
Sheriff Eben Olesen (Josh Hartnett) to do except brood over his 
separation from his fire marshall wife, Stella (Melissa George). 
As darkness descends for its annual 30-day day, though, a series 
of bizarre discoveries rocks the town--and very soon Marlow (Danny Huston) 
and his minions arrive. Eben, his little brother Jake (Mark Rendall), 
Stella, and a handful of others are forced to hide and fight for 
their lives until the sun returns.

Cast: Josh Hartnett, Melissa George, Megan Franich, Danny Huston, Mark Rendall.

Shot in the Middle East with unsettling immediacy, the hand-held 
ameras put viewers right inside the action, while the tension 
between American FBI agents and their Saudi counterparts maintains 
an interesting uncertainty about whoâ??s "right" and whoâ??s "wrong. 
The bad guys, however, are unmistakable. The film opens with a 
brutal terrorist attack on an oil company compound in Saudi Arabia, 
where a visiting FBI agent is killed. Back home in Washington, fellow 
agents Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) and Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), 
will do whatever it takes to gain access to the investigation. Once there, 
they encounter the resistance of a Saudi government more interested in 
getting the Americans safely out of the country and avoiding conflict, 
rather than in solving the crime.

Cast: Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Jeremy Piven,	 Ali Suliman.
