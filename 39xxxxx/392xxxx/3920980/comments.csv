,fetterey,2009-03-14T22:46Z,"I can not play heroes 3, when I open the file, so it comes up 2 ISO files, one is at 536 mb and the other is at 408 mb.
one file called heroes3 and the other H3_disk2, when I open the file I have to choose between many applications, for example: Windows media player, VLC media player, Internet, paint and so on ....
How can I play Heroes and Might and Magic 3?"
,Kihoro,2009-12-20T11:47Z,"Thanks alot for seeding, i'm getting 50/mbit atm :)"

,kaptenmange,2010-02-10T09:18Z,To install just just power iso or smothing... but there is no real crak for this game so the best way is to burn it
,DramaTiqq,2010-04-22T21:43Z,"Downloading speed is average/good atm (1.3MB/s) but I will seed afterwards so it'll be up at about 4-6.5 MB/s.

So if you wanna DL, do it in like an hour! :D
Gr8 game btw!"
,Persekarva,2010-06-05T19:59Z,"I see that alot of people are unfamiliar with how to access ISO and other CD-image files, so i decided to post some instructions :)

You need to download an application called Daemon Tools from the URL below:

http://www.disk-tools.com/download/daemon

This program creates a virtual CD-ROM drive, and lets you access image files just like if they were a real CD in a real drive.

When you have the program installed, run it and then right-click the icon in the lower right corner of your taskbar. Select ""Mount image"" and then find and select the image file you want to mount.

Once you have done this, the virtual CD will be accessible just like if it was a real one."
,Persekarva,2010-06-05T20:00Z,Testing...
,Gods.username,2010-06-21T15:40Z,Sweet hastighet dude (y)

,lgh,2010-06-26T00:04Z,480 kB/s.. really nice
,The_Punisher911,2010-08-10T16:41Z,"Apparently no crack is needed, just mount Heroes3 iso file to install. Then mount H3_disk2 iso file to play the game and its expansions.

Piece of cake!"
,malone33,2010-09-03T12:36Z,"Be sure and download the stereo music fix for the game.  All the Heroes games have FANTASTIC music (IV prolly being the best).  Originally it was thought the game's mp3 decoder was faulty, now come to find out the game's call for the ""waveout"" device asks to make the sound 22kHz/mono instead of 44kHz/stereo.  Here's the forum where you can read about and download it:

or the direct link:

http://www.celestialheavens.com/homm3/patches/h3sndfix.zip

Also, be sure and get the lesser known '8 Chronicles' for HOMM3 as well.  They were little mini-episodes the creator (Jon Van Caneghem) made for the game.  Here's the PBay link for them:
