	1. Hard Copy 'Down in it' investigation-
		Another request. 
		Audio quality a little dodgy. 
		Many thanks again to Slaytez for this footage. 
		10 minutes

	2. Various MTV interviews from the 90's-
		Various interviews and news stories that didn't make it onto part 1. 
		Includes all the Kennedy interviews that heaps of people have asked for.
		Bowie/Trent 1995 interviews, Superock, Alternative Nation, 120 minutes with Lewis Sargent, etc.
		Props again to Slaytez for supplying the bulk of this footage. 
		80 minutes.

	3. Japanese 'Garageheadz' interview/clips 2000 -
		Very nice little special. 
		30 minutes.
