,Rekuza,2008-02-03T15:01Z,"what a load of shit, spent 2-3 days downloading thanks to shit-house seeders only for it to not work.. 

dont download this, doesn't work on your PS2 i tried burning with multiple DVD's and different programs, always the same result.. and no, it's not my mod chip..

wasted my bloody time downloading and uploading with a high upload rate, thanks for nothing.."
