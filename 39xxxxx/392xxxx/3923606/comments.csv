,gamemusta,2008-09-07T11:54Z,"yalls better off gettin it from ms direct java download.
means you'll get more consistent speed >_>
and you wont have to wait for any seeding :D
this is from me and JAKEhp55 >:D

Key for Visual Studio 8 Professional (NOT TEAM): XMQ2Y4T3V6XJ48YD3K2V6C4WT

Download from Microsoft's site
http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7701859 (direct)
OR
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/bb655861.aspx (indirect)
OR
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vs2008/products/cc268305.aspx (indirect)

Install then reboot, rerun setup and it should say maintenance mode. Continue until you get the screen to choose what to do. At the bottom is upgrade. Just put in key and hit upgrade. No torrenting necessary :D

Though you can still seed it ;) "
,Trublu0,2008-09-07T23:32Z,"The MS download link is a wreck. It's 'resume' feature does not work.
Another link http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=83c3a1ec-ed72-4a79-8961-25635db0192b&DisplayLang=en
does not seem to work with other download mgrs."
[T],xybrite,2008-09-16T05:21Z,"Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This download ROCKS!"
,CaptainPicard,2008-11-10T16:56Z,Stupid idiot that gave the links to get it from Microsoft did not bother to tell anyone that they had no control over the dowload once it started or that it installed a java download manager that could not be stopped or shut down.  If I wanted Microsoft to have access to everything on my system I wouldn't have disabled all their gargage to start with.
,kvartns,2008-11-21T15:45Z,"Hi guys,
Can anybody help me with download speed of this torrent?

,redtulip,2008-12-08T06:33Z,trying to download. Please increase seeds....
,nucklearknight,2008-12-14T19:58Z,Just download Firefox. It has a built in download manager.

,rhyno02,2009-02-21T01:37Z,"Thanks for this, very much.
Patches are required for this installation to get the forms showing (otherwise there is an error). They are as follows:
http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/d/1/4d177439-44ba-46b2-98b3-a4d581589668/Windows6.0-KB930264-x86.msu

Once installed, it works a treat.
Thanks again."
,brian420,2009-02-27T17:13Z,"Great quality movie?  Fantastic quality film?

Am I imagining things, but isn't Microsoft Visual Studio an integrated development environment allowing for coding of applications and services, and *not* a movie/video?

Those commenting such must be high."
,Deathball101,2009-03-18T04:40Z,"@brian420
You're correct, Visual Studio is a programming development environment. However, None of the comments I'm seeing have anything to do with movies, just programming, seeding, and download managers. Which comments are you referring to?"
,JUHA3x,2009-03-22T10:31Z,Vista x64 ?
,tannhausser,2009-03-22T15:16Z,"@brian420
WTF?"
,caseyfw,2009-04-03T23:30Z,"@slutface90

Cheers! You just saved me from this completely useless torrent! Why torrent when you can abuse MS bandwidth?"

,jabunk20,2009-12-08T00:15Z,yaep thats it dude i always keep seeding 
,ice_bat,2010-05-03T21:07Z,"this torrent didn't work for me.

i had a win xp sp3 fresh install, then i installed this visual studio and then i got error messages for everything i tried to do, not to mention it slowed down my computer.

uninstalled it, but speed was still slow and pc was buggy so i had to reinstall windows again..."
