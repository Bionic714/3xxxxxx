,angelblake20,2009-04-07T01:07Z,is there any way you can upload this without the commentary? i downloaded it and there's no way to turn it off
,keroppifrog,2009-05-27T16:02Z,"as angelblake20 said, this video has the directors commentary overtop of the entire movie rendering it unwatchable for anyone who just wants to see the normal movie.
however, it is a great quality upload of trekkies2 for anyone who wants to watch the movie with the directors commentary."
,Necros_21,2009-07-02T12:55Z,"There's only one audio stream? Can't we choose? Anyway, thanks for uploading."
,BudJonze,2009-09-25T11:13Z,"I've played this file on both VLC and KMPLayer and there are indeed TWO AUDIO TRACKS -- Track 1 being the regular, non-commentary audio and Track 2 is w/ filmmakers' commentary.   As long as you're using a decent media player such as KMPlayer, VLC, SMPlayer, etc., you should have no problems choosing which audio to play.

Again, THERE ARE TWO AUDIO TRACKS IN THIS FILE.
