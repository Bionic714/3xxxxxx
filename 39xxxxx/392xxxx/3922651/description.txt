[PSX] King's Field(CCD) + manual(PDF) [US] [NTSC]

back cover:
Prepare yourself for an epic action-adventure never before imaginable.  Only 
now, with the gaming power made possible by the Playstation is a world as 
vast and detailed as King's Field a reality.  This first-person game is 
completely rendered in beautiful 3D polygon graphics, with texture mapping 
and fully controllable 360 degree viewing.

Imagine a universe where you can travel freely - being able to look up and 
down, climb ancient ruins, traverse across oceans, jump off ridges, and duel 
enemies - all in real time non-linear play.  This visual world will not only 
astound you, but pull you right into its universe.  You will embark on a 
journey to an island of evil-ridden dungeons, villages, and castles as you 
seek the Moonlight Sword, which had been stolen by a cult of insidious 
worshippers of evil.

And now your journey begins...
