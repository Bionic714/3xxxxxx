,starwind291,2008-03-13T08:10Z,dude somethings wrong with your torrent when i open it it dont download 
,007ace,2008-06-04T08:39Z,"Ever think that since well over 100 people have downloaded this torrent, that maybe its your computer/program thats the problem.
If you want help ask. Don't blame the uploader."
,NoSoup4you22,2008-06-13T23:56Z,Thanks for these man. Good show.
,ladyniko,2008-07-27T22:18Z,Thanks for the upload!
,fakebest,2009-12-24T06:25Z,"Yay useless comments well time for a worth while one.  Season 3 is 13 episodes not 26 yet there is 26 files in this torrent so pick the 13 of season that are in order and uncheck the other 13.  Good job 2crazy4u on uploading bloated, out of order, pointless extra files to this torrent but besides the huge screw up thanks for the 13 final episodes of season 3.  BTW when I say bloated it's because it's 2009, h.264 encoded mp4 files should be chosen instead of old bad codecs google it instead of commenting."
,QborT,2010-07-26T00:50Z,"Ignore fakebest's comment... This is not season 3 this is VOLUME 3 ....

the uploader has made 3 VOLUMES not seasons

Thanks 2Crazy4u"
,GeekHillbilly,2010-10-24T15:53Z,Thanks.I've been looking for these for a long time.
,bukiluverboy,2010-12-17T10:29Z,thanks keep seeding i havent seen this since i was a kid 
,oprahb747,2011-05-30T05:41Z,"Thanks for the great uploads 2Crazy4u. This is the final season that I am downloading, and I'll probably download Return of the Joker just to finish the collection. Batman Beyond truly is a work of its own, in that it separates itself from all the other animated Batman series'. Again I'd like to personally give you thanks for the work you put into sharing these and all your other files to TPB. God Bless"
