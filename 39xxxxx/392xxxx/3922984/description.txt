These are my rips of Batman Beyond, which I created using the original DVDs
as the source for these rips. These are ripped that same way my JLU rips were
done, so I am pleased with them.

I have made 3 volumes that all fit on a DVD for ease of upload and storage.
A fourth upload will include my rip of Return of the Joker. I will upload each
one at a time until I have seeders and then move to the next one.

As a special treat from MahBoff are 4 JPEG files that he created for DVD covers
that I thought looked good. They are not professional, but they are better
than what I would have created. Like them or not, they are there.

This is Volume 3 of 3

Note: It will take at least 2-3 days for me to finish to the first seed. Just bear with me please.
