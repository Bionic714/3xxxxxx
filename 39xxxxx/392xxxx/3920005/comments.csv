Had this file for sometime, it works good on my system, however my friend had to use DosBox to get the sound to work. Either way its pretty simple to do"
,firecatcher,2007-12-06T06:29Z,"well cool.cheerz!
Played the shit out of these 2 on my amiga 500, forgot how great they are, played with sound and everthing when i ran it thru daemon tools, gonna burn it on disk now and sent it to my dad coz he got it (pirated) for me originally!"

,FridgeBoy,2008-02-09T22:47Z,"Hi, Having trouble running in Vista Home Prem x64. Any help greatly appreciated, thankyou please."
,Fallcore,2008-02-15T01:28Z,"FridgeBoy, have not tested in vista. But you could try ScummVM which you can get here http://www.scummvm.org/ . or DosBox whitch you can get here http://www.dosbox.com/.

Both are emulators, ScummVM particularly designed for Lucas games, and DosBox for general Dos Games."
,treviz,2008-02-17T19:21Z,"I get this message every time I try to ""start"" the file with Deamon Tools : 
 Mokey
 NTVDM CPU got a wrong instruction.
 CS:c000 ip:00ac OP: ff ff ff ff ff press close to cancel the program.  (something like that :P)

what to do??"
,Fallcore,2008-04-05T04:15Z,Try a different mounting tool.
,nekochan52,2008-04-27T06:00Z,"Hi, I'm fairly new with torrents.  I downloaded the files, but I apparently don't have the proper programs to read the CCD, CUE, SUB, or IMG files (I'm using XP).  Is there a program I need?  I really have no idea what to do from here >."
,mrackham,2008-04-28T01:41Z,".img is a CloneCD file. In windows you can use MagicISO to burn it or convert it to an ISO. In Linux you can use ccd2iso...

Just an FYI for others, I wasn't able to get the sound to work with SCUMMvm since they appear to be audio tracks on the CD image"
,fishyfishybill,2008-06-06T19:33Z,"to get the sound in ScummVM, mount the image with daemon tools, use windows media player to rip the audio as mp3 from the disk. name them as track1.mp3 track2.mp3 etc. copy the files from the monkey island one folder on the disk into a folder on your hard drive, put the mp3s in this directory and tell scummvm that all of the game data is in this folder

how to get the audio working using DOSbox is puzzling me though"
,fluxx__,2008-07-24T15:09Z,"this probably sounds so stupid. but i can't figure out how to get these two working. i've got scummvm and dosbox, and i just don't understand. i've got daemon tools too. but no matter what i do or try, i can't seem to get them working? i've downloaded curse of monkey island and grim fandango from you, and they both work perfectly. i've also tried to download other MI1+2s but they don't work either. can someone please help me out???"
,fluxx__,2008-07-24T15:10Z,"oh and thanks for any help anyone can give me? 

please i really wanna play these games!! "
,xeontech,2008-10-13T15:04Z,has anyone else had a problem with the sound coming out as white noise? I burnt the .img with K3B in Linux and it seems to be fine - it runs okay in ScummVM except the sound played is white noise. I played the tracks straight off the CD in my audio player and its the same thing. Any ideas?
,Laith_88,2009-11-08T23:31Z,"I'm stuck at 67%. Seed, people, seed. I've uploaded 46MB of the file already and I'm still a peer, even though my connection is 128 kb/s. That is the pirate spirit!"
,Laith_88,2009-11-15T14:02Z,"It works perfectly with ScummV on Vista. Ripped the audio files into mp3's and named them track1, track2 etc... and sound works as well. Thanks."
