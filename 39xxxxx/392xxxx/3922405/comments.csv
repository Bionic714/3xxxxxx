,Win2Kuser,2008-01-04T01:00Z,"Well I downloaded it, and I'm sure as hell not dumb you freaking jackass!

Wearing your disk out would be dumb, this is the smart thing to do.

Tested on 32bit and 64bit, works perfectly on 32, not on 64 though.

Rename the crysis.exe file to crysis-old.exe or something, and copy this extracted file into the bin32 folder.

Job done, I can now keep my shiny disk looking that way safe and sound in it's case.

Cheers for sharing dude :)"

Works fine on 32bit, even fixed a few problems with the crysis startup!"
