Racism: A History: The 20th Century (Pt. 3/3) BBC  2007.04.04 avi


The third and final episode of Racism: A History examines the impact of racism
in the 20th Century. By 1900, European colonial expansion had reached deep into the
heart of Africa. Under the rule of King Leopold II, The Belgian Congo was turned
into a vast rubber plantation.

Men, women and children who failed to gather their
latex quotas would have their limbs dismembered. The country became the scene of
one of the century's greatest racial genocides, as an estimated 10 million Africans
perished under colonial rule.
