SmartWhois is a useful network information utility that allows you to find out all available information about an IP address, host name, or domain, including country, state, city, name of the network provider, and administrator and technical support contact information. Unlike standard Whois utilities, SmartWhois can find the information about a computer located in any part of the world, intelligently querying the right database and delivering all the related records within a few seconds. SmartWhois can save obtained information to an archive file, cache obtained information, process lists of IP addresses or domains, work in batch mode, and export data in different formats. It has plug-ins for MS Internet Explorer, MS Outlook, Maxthon Browser, Mozilla/SeaMonkey Navigator, Netscape Browser and Flock.
