It seems to miss a few trojans here and there.
The program that found the trojans and a few ad-ware was called...ad-aware or something...I need a program that is an all in one Spyware, adware, trajon, worm and a virus scanner. Anyone know where I might find such a program?"

The only thing that you can do to be a 100% safe is to stop downloading and turn off your computer :)"
