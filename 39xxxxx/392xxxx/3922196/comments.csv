,zalowishus,2008-08-17T05:25Z,"The MOST proFoND movie I've EVER SEEN, I can't EVER get that one guys pain out of my mind - ever -ever -ever. 
I never knew him but I cry for him everyday, I just wish I could have hugged him. Maybe that's all he needed. Maybe that's alll any of any of these people needed. "

,Zinklo,2009-08-19T18:58Z,"Appears to me that you, zalowishus haven't ever been depressed?
Not being able to enjoy anything, feeling as if you're a very expendable being is what real depression is. Something that can not be cured by a simple hug."
,headies420,2010-09-14T05:25Z,"true thing Zinklo, very accurately said..."
,Philonetic,2010-12-14T22:33Z,"it appears that you Zinklo have no idea what real hardship is.  REAL people dont have time to get ""depressed"".  Heres an idea, use your brain and get over it.  Whatever you think is bad for you, MANY other people are MUCH worse off.  Youre like a child that thinks, if you cry long enough, somebody will help you.  Get REAL."
,Philonetic,2010-12-14T22:36Z,"Just IMO, but first of all, these people live in CALIFORNIA, not the hills of Thailand, not Eastern Europe, not South Africa.  If they're ignorant enough to kill themselves, great, clean out the gene pool.  Some people would rather FIGHT for LIFE, no matter how hard it gets.  This is not a game and there is no reset button."
,jengiscan,2011-06-27T18:21Z,"I f only it was that simple Philonetic but depression is an illness affecting both rich and poor and it sometimes defies understanding.
Now get back to your Ayn Rand books."
,lattari,2012-03-11T01:54Z,"@jengiscan agreed. Depression is the ultimate mindfuck and people who haven't been swimming where the sun doesn't shine should just be grateful and go easy on the judging. Besides, poverty exists all around the world. Thanks for the up."
,lattari,2012-03-11T01:56Z,Finland for example is second in the per capita suicide listings every year after Japan.
