,keon110,2008-08-16T21:21Z,Hey when I have a problem.The MDF file I had burn it on a dvd by the DVD Decrypter and since now is all good.But when inserting the dvd it comes the icon of the game on my computer and when pressing on it nothing happen PLEASE HELP PLEASE!!! what is wrong
,keon110,2008-08-16T22:51Z,OWW I do it all you have to do to install it is first burn it on a dvd by clicking on the MDF file (download this software if you do not have a software http://www.filehippo.com/download_imgburn/ ) Then you want to right click on the disk on My Computer/explore and there you can find a.exe run it and it begins its installation then there is the crack too in the explore 
,keon110,2008-08-16T23:31Z,If you want to play online and with your friends you can just download xfire from www.xfire.com make an account and you will have your own website to that will be in how much you played games and the time an example of this is www.xfire.com/profile/luca100 .then when downloading xfire search on xfire.com/downloads and search for the patch not the server because they have the patch of the server too.then when you install it you can search the servers from the client and the part of the servers because there are more parts because you can chat with others.For any problem contact me on xfire just add me with that + sign and search for luca100 and I will help you.

,gabriel1475,2009-12-20T09:45Z,"Umm....it's $9.99 on Steam, Ubi, and at various online stores. No patching, hacking, searching, mounting, cursing, and stress. Plus, you wont have to worry about trying to find countless fixes to countless problems. Some people are not only cheap, but dont value their own invested time. If it takes you even just two hours to get this up and running vs. about $10 to buy it, then you are pretty comically motivated to save a whopping ten bucks. Nobody can possibly be that poor. Have some self respect. After reading all of the problems everyone is having, I'm buying it! Have fun troubleshooting it, while others are playing it."
,Zenit33,2009-12-31T13:35Z,"Lads, its $4.99 now on Steam.

plus better graphics, is: IL-2 1946. For 5 USD.

,.BlackIce,2010-01-20T23:30Z,"Ok, both of you above me need to shut the fuck up.  First off, don't spam shit about buying it on Steam because it's 5 bucks.  This is a TORRENT WEBSITE, and incase your brain dead retards that don't understand what that means, we want this for free, 5 bucks or not.

For anyone who has installed this and has only gotten German language, after you mount the file, open up the folder in the directory of the mounted DVD file, and go to the folder called 1033 and run the autorun.exe file from there.  That is English, the others are German."
,tdctop,2010-01-23T22:36Z,"I agree with .BlackIce
If you want to use your money on supporting the pile of software feces called steam, go ahead, be my guest!

We are not pirating really, people just say that, in fact its a person that brought the game and is simply sharing it with us, what a kind person.

,justin56606,2010-12-29T13:30Z,"Yeah...No. This torrent is a little convoluted and you have to do a lot of work to get around it, but perhaps its because I'm using Vista...Microsoft bastards. The dodgy instructions don't help either unless you speak Spanglench, or whatever combination of languages uncalfesta is speaking. Props for the torrent dude but its a little confusing.
As for the hearty conversation about Steam, fuck Steam. It's nice for people like zegga who like condoms. We all know its on sale but I'm not about to pay $5 for something unless I know its diamond encrusted shit. As for us pirates, fuck the dodgy instructions, I didn't go to computer academy (Frisky Dingo) to be beaten by some Spaniard (or Hispanic). I, and the rest of the pirates, will find a way to play this game for free."

,austingulick,2011-05-14T21:54Z,"Ok, so I encountered just about every problem listed here. Luckily, I did eventually make it work. Here's how:

1. Dowload the Torrent (obviously).
2. Use Daemon Tools (or other Imaging software) to mount the .mds file.
3. Do not AUTORUN!
4. Go to ""My Computer"" and right click on the disk drive (image should be mounted showing the icon for the game).
5. Open folder to view contents.
6. Run a.exe (setup program)
7. Once installed, the game will not run. (it will tell you to use original game disc and not back-up)
8. Go to google and search il2fb.exe (I wont post the link as the last image posted was taken down, but I will give you a hint... its the first one :D)
9. Download il2fb.exe 
10. Find the file you downloaded (it wont be in the Sturmovik folder, probably Documents/downloads)
11. Cut file and paste it into the game file. (C:/Program Files(x86)/Ubisoft/Il-2 Sturmovik 1946 by default)
12. It will ask you if you want to replace the existing file. You definitely want to, if you the old one their it wont work properly.
13. Once pasted, just double-click il2fb.exe and the game should run.

Hope this Helps!"
