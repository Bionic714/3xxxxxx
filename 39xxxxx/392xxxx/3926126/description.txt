S p e c i a l   I n f o   N o t e :

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of a packed exe 

( juicy2-start.exe )

as a lame virus, (coz its thebyte by byte check error of em!.) 

Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics

you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!.

(heuristics).    >>>  thank you for reading!.
