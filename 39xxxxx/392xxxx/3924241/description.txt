History tells us that these Masses were Haydn's last major compositions, written by an old and tired man in times of war. The music itself, especially in performances of such warmth and brilliance as these, reveals no trace of the waning of mental or physical powers that Haydn himself lamented; where there are shadows, they are cast not by external circumstance but by the composer's vivid response to the words of the Ordinary. Although the rich and colourful orchestration justifies the familiar name of the 'Wind-band Mass', the 'Creation' Mass too rejoices in Haydn's imaginative scoring. One of the pleasures of Gardiner's performances is that the orchestral detail is so clearly and affectionately projected, without the listener ever feeling that attention is being distracted from the grand design.
