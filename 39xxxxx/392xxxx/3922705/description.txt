this is a bootleg i picked up in a used video store for a couple bucks.  it features most every music video meth and red have been in, including guest spots.  there is a lot of their solo stuff (from docs da name 2000 to dare iz a darkside and tical 2000 to tical), videos from the blackout, wu tang clan, EPMD, etc.  no menu just back to back videos, unfortunately whoever put this together normalized all the sound so the audio is not so great.  it is begging for a remaster.  but still cool to watch these videos through your dvd player, a must for your next blunt session.
