,jkillah1,2008-06-06T00:37Z,"OK, for those of you who are kind of confused about what this download is, I'll give you the REAL simple explanation:

There are 100 separate NES files.
Then there is one GBA file, which has been hacked to contain 100 NES games.  It's like a collection of games on one cart.  It works well on my PSP's GBA emulator, so that's good; means I don't have to get a NES emulator now!"
