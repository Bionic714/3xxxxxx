I really appreciate this torrent, and I will seed. But please take note that RARing mp3's is useless, as they are already compressed. The RAR file you made is actually larger than the sum of the files after extracting.
In the future, I suggest you not RAR your large uploads, you'll get more seeders, because then your seeders won't have to use up 2x as much space on their harddrive if they want to seed and listen."
,spopt36,2008-02-06T00:46Z,"sorry, its not larger, but it's still only compressed by .02 GB"

,beverbeverbever,2008-12-31T15:30Z,"Please, don't ever put albums in 1 rar file again..."
,DBAW95060,2009-05-08T05:12Z,"""Please, don't ever put albums in 1 rar file again...""

The only problem I've ever noticed with rar'd files is the tendency towards audio glitches which are simple to ameliorate by simply shutting down all unnecessary processes... A/V programs, windows etc while packing or unpacking them, as compressing/decompressing files is very cpu intensive.

The other drawback is one can't pick and choose which files in the archive they'd like, but thats a *personal* problem. "
