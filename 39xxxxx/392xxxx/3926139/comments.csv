Capacitor."
,pikkie001,2007-12-14T19:23Z,"Pikkie001 did never shut down...
Pikkie001 had to seed to 578 leechers at the same time... Because it's porn, of course...
So, well... everyone has to be patient at these hard times, capacitor"
,pikkie001,2007-12-14T19:30Z,"Seems you NEVER uploaded ANYTHING, Capacitor46"

,pikkie001,2010-04-05T15:00Z,"Ok, people. I get loads of questions about not working trackers. Because of several international lawsuits the old Piratebay trackers aren't up anymore. Here's a list of trackers that are up and running:

http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce

http://tracker.publicbt.com/announce

http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce

Of course you keep using DHT combined with Peer Exchange."
