Avg. Rating:  4.4 / 5 (based on 11 ratings). What did you think of it?  

Plot: A tale about Cheung (Hung), a cuckolded husband, sent on a wild roller-coaster ride of spooky encounters when his wife's wealthy lover tries to do away with him with the help of a Taoist monk's black magic. 
 
Overview: The film that was thought to have revolutionized the Hong Kong horror genre, this Sammo Hung film evenly blends fantastic, acrobatic action, light hearted comedy, and some genuine scares. Hung stars as Courageous Cheung, a coward whose reputation proves otherwise. Cheung is dared to spend the night in a haunted house. However, he has been set up by his wife's rich lover, who has paid a Taoist priest to kill him with his magic (controlling vampires). However, he survives and teams up with the Taoist priest's brother to get revenge. A wonderful all around martial arts/horror piece that is yet another superb film by Sammo Hung. One of the best of it's kind, this film mixes suspense, mild horror, comedy, and kung-fu. The end fight is a showstopper with some of the best non-wire fighting you'll ever see. 
The final duel in Spooky Encounters is rated by Hong Kong Action Cinema as the great Samo Hung' second best fight scene ever, only next to his historically famous encounter with Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon.
