[T],kef71,2007-12-07T22:06Z,"wormman: I was downloading Enterprise with the intention to help seed. Instead I managed to delete the incomplete files when making room for TNG S5.  So I actually wasted an unknown number of GB's instead. Sorry for the fxxkup... 

Lession number #49152 in life learned:

Don't drink and do computer stuff.
