,Had3swar,2007-12-27T23:07Z,Hello. Can you tell me if this Leopard Mac OS X works on a Compaq Presario C551NR Notebook PC? Will I need to look for drivers?
,evan2121,2008-01-28T13:10Z,"I'm sorry, I don't know where else to ask..... It's not safe to receive updates from the Mac Website if you have a copy of Leopard from a different source other than the company right? Can they track that?"
