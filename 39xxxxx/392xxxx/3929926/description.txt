Discordance Axis/Corrupted/324 split
This was a split that came out just around the same time as The Inalienable Dreamless. For some reason, the 2nd DxAx song is, well, just a few minutes of silence or something...

Discordance Axis 
1. Ikaruga   
2. Berserk   
Corrupted (Jpn) 
3. Bloodscape   
4. Bougyaku No Basyo   
324 
5. Terminal Chamber   
6. Prismrider   
7. Just Sit There 


Discordance Axis - Our Last Day
This one is only kind of a DxAx release as it contains 2 original DxAx songs, 17 covers of DxAx by other bands, a complete noise remix of The Inalienable Dreamless by Merzbow and a single track from Jon Chang (DxAx vocalist) new band Gridlink. It's worth it for the originals, the remix, Gridlink and the Melt Banana cover, but otherwise this is prolly just for collectors & die hards...

Bands are as follows:
1-2: Discordance Axis, 3-12: Cide Projeckt, 13-14: Gate, 15-17: Mortalized, 18: Melt Banana, 19: Noiseear, 20: Merzbow, 21: Gridlink
