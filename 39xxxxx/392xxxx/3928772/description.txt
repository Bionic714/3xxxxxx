|  	How did it all begin? How come the name Hero In Action? 	     |
|		Maybe you'll find an answer here?                            |
|                                                                            |
|HERO in action had a different name in the beginning, the name was          | 
|Stoneville. They started to rock in 2001. The place was Kungsbacka, a small |
|town south of GÃ¶teborg. The two guitarists, Tomas and Daniel, had played    |
|together before but they wanted to start a band that really had the         |
|potential to become something special. And with Robin behind the drums they | 
|contacted the former hardcore screamer Rickard and asked him if he was      |
|interested in doing some singing. Rickard who had bin playing heavy music   |
|for a long time felt that this could be a fresh restart. After a few        |
|rehearsals with Rickard behind the mic Stoneville was formed. Stoneville    |
|had two different bassists before DG joined the band in March 2004.         |
|After have bin playing over 50 gigs the band was contacted by a record      |
|lable called Sunday music. They wanted to sign a contract. Not long after,  |
|the band went into the studio and started the recordings for their          |
|coming album. During that time the band felt that they wanted a namechange. |
|HERO in action was now born!                                                |
