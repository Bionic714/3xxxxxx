,joybringer,2007-12-09T21:02Z,"I have downloaded that movie and now I remember why I got so upset with Duras'productions, as well as suppa-intellectuals' ones like Robert Wilson, people who got so fashionable for doing 'intelligent' stuff in Paris. In reality empty and despicable products, full of contempt for the spectator (which wouldnt be a problem as he deserves it) but overall highly self sufficent and barely stupid. I had to escape several times somnolent crowds merely falling asleep at Bob Wilson's shows... furious.
the author Duras is just a cunt, in french or in translation as well, like many others she grabbed that so called brainy trend because that was the best to get the money at the time.
Those miserable fakers opened the way for nowadays worst productions, cause you rather stare at pink monsters with glittering yellow eyes for hours than being adressed in such a boring way about non-existent matters forever. Duras and alike are getting forgotten like fashionable artists of their times with no long-time interest.
May they rest in piss."

Can someone tell me what's up with the subs though ? I'll not bother with it if they're fucked up."
,joybringer,2007-12-23T15:42Z,"You'll love it with or without the subs. Or just have a look at the back of your computer for a while, all the same."
