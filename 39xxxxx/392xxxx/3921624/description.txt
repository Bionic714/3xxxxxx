Third full length from Thinking Machines.  Due out in a couple weeks.  http://www.myspace.com/thinkingmachines

Newly a 3 piece, Thinking Machines latest album incorporates heavier elements of post-punk, krautrock and math-rock with their usual indie, shoegaze, dream pop and space rock elements to great effect.  The most rhythmically driving and rocking album from these guys yet.
