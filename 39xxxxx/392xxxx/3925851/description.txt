The Mighty Boosh

Series 3

Episodes 1, 2, 3 and 4

As broadcast in the UK on BBC Three.  DVB signal captured from \\\"Freeview\\\" broadcast using a Miglia TV card and EyeTV software: then turned into VOBs and burnt to DVD using Toast software.

Should be identical quality to original broadcast, and certainly appears to be so to my eyes!  Though this is not brilliant in the UK! - 2 hours MPEG2 video and MPEG1 audio (at 256 kbps) coming in at 3.25 Gb. 

And the fairly unobtrusive BBC3 logo is present.

Absolutely bloody hilarious telly anyway.

And have included custom cover in psd and epson printCD formats.

Hope you enjoy.

Thanks.
