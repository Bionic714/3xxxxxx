,RollinsB,2007-12-13T04:25Z,What is .flac? I've never heard of the file format.
,mikesum32,2007-12-18T02:50Z,"FLAC is Free Lossless Audio Codec, like shn (shorten) or .ape (Monkey's Audio), it compresses wav files losslessly. This mean you get the exact audio that was ripped from the cd. Think of it as zip for audio.

,Sanicle,2007-12-19T06:23Z,whereas those of us who don't have superhuman hearing and prefer hard disk space will still choose MP3. think of it as JPEG for audio :) http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3290448/Donnie_Darko_SoundTrack
,Sanicle,2007-12-19T06:31Z,PS - not saying anything against this torrent. Just providing an alternative.
,logan993,2008-08-11T10:59Z,Tnx Sanicle :-))
,DAnisbril,2008-10-22T08:34Z,"Guys, be aware, this is the film score NOT the soundtrack, so you're getting all the atmospheric stuff that backs up the scenes in the film, not the pop stuff from the time the film is set in (ie, duran duran, the church, echo & the bunny men)"
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2009-04-23T17:46Z,Nice. Thanks.
