I hope that the title is indeed the movie. From the work Eisenstein did in Mexico, there will never exist the real movie. A lot of pseudo-attempts have been made : JAY LEYDA, MARIE SETON, and even GRICHA : GRIGORI ALEXANDROV, the latest version in France, made in 1980, and now considered as official release. I'm glad to have the opportunity to look at this one !"
