Shystie's debut album, Diamond In The Dirt was released in the UK Only under record label Polydor, Universal.

The record consists of 15 tracks including bonus tracks all written by herself (aside from collborations where other artist wrote their own lyrics), She named her album this title as she felt the what she was doing was different and stood out amongst the rest.

This went on to sell 55,000 copies across the UK, Shystie's first single was 'ONE WISH' and the B-Side was a 'One Wish Remix' produced my Terror Danja which featured Kano and entered the charts at 40, having no main stream radio or music channels support aside Channel U and MTV Base.

Her second single was 'MAKE IT EASY' and the b-side was 'JUICED' unfortunately all major record stores did not get copies of this single in time during its week of release leaving it to chart poorly but regardless of this Shystie was still Nominated for 'Best Newcomer' at the MOBO awards
