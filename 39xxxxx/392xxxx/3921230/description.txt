David Guetta - Baby When The Light (Dirty South Remix 2007) [Electro House]


There still isn't a discogs entry for this particular remix or the promo release from whence this comes...



David Guetta - Baby When The Light (Dirty South Remix).mp3 [8:53]

20.3MB

320KBps.


Re-post.

The previous entry on my schedule was the entire promotional CD single in VBR with the exception of this remix which I posted as it is here in clean crispy 320KBps.

I see no pragmatic reason to re-post the entire release, since the Dirty South remix is, and will always be, the ONE.


Enjoy and please seed.
