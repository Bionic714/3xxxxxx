-Scott"
,Bill73,2007-12-08T02:47Z,"Nothing weird for me! Works like a charm! 

Many thanks"
,pejos,2007-12-08T14:51Z,serial not working?

,superbad1,2007-12-09T04:08Z,worked for me.
,Silverbird0000,2007-12-09T10:01Z,I just downloaded build 5582 (Leopard Compatible) from the Parallels website and used the Serial here and it worked awesome!  Thank you so much!  I needed this since the upgrade to Leopard.
,Apple_freak,2007-12-09T10:45Z,Works great.

,bubastisbastet,2007-12-16T06:29Z,"had build 5160; upgraded to 5582 but then it asked for a new serial! 

1S7V8-A916B-VWMGL-RNLH3-QN6SA

as below worked a charm

Thx!"
,kocoman,2007-12-16T09:38Z,Is this the final release of 3.0?
,Nightwatch,2007-12-18T18:31Z,Problably not.... The last version before V4 is likely to be the final V3 version ;-)
,Vertiphon25,2007-12-18T22:39Z,"Appreciate the upload, Timdorr.  However, whilst it installs and runs fine... I tried starting an XP VM, installed XP (albeit from an old 2002 upgrade copy, only one I have), and I regularly got crashes.  It seems Parallels isn't worth the hassle any more, it's just not stable enough.

So, I'll be trying VMWare Fusion next..."
[V],joshua13,2007-12-24T02:57Z,"On the contrary I find it extremely stable and hassle free. Parallels with XP (installed from a version with SP2 slip streamed in) and another VM with Vista has NEVER crashed for me. I use it daily. I have seen no wide-spread reports of instability or usability problems - except temporary ones the publisher quickly fixed - but no stream of repeated problems without fully stable versions or anything like that. This program is widely acclaimed as excellent and the publisher is very good, communicative and responsive. So if you try it and like it - pay for a copy! I did."
,Wolver212,2007-12-30T16:45Z,"Downloaded from the Parallels website, and the key worked just fine...THX, timdorr"
,Ulfaslak,2008-01-04T12:03Z,Do i actually need a f*ing windows installation cd to use this ? Or does it work if I just download it - Windows?
,italicus,2008-01-08T17:40Z,Thanks really a lot for sharing this.   Thanks to the great programmers of Parallels!!
,kgulaalex,2008-01-09T20:07Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL
i have succesfully installed leopard on 
Sempron64 2600 2x512 ram ati9550 256mb
IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR HARD DRIVE
IT HAPPENED TO ME. IT IS NOT A JOKE. THIS WILL CRIPPLE YOUR BOOT FILES:
""invalid partition table""
WITH LUCK YOU CAN INSTALL VISTA BUT NO XP
if you have already installed... leopard is stuck on 60hz refresh rate with no ati drivers and it is IMPOSSIBLE OT RUN WINDOWS APPS ON IT. You will get error.
.
.
.
YOU RISK PERMANENT DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER WITH ANY LEOPARD INSTALLATION.
I am not a n00b and i will not touch os x again after what happened. I AM STILL UNABLE TO INSTALL XP and writing from vista

""invalid partition table"" at boot. BEWARE AND DO NOT DOWNLOAD. i had a perfect case install and still...

DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL ON YOUR OWN RISK. COMPUTER PERMANENTLY DAMAGED WITH ANY LEOPARD NOT JUST THIS ONE. it`s because of hfs.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
i wrote this to prevent otherf from experiencing what i have gone through."
,Mac_PPC,2008-01-11T02:01Z,"Rambling on about how OSX86 broke your PC in the comments to a torrent about Parallels proves you are a n00b.

And if you can't fix an ""invalid partition table"", then you're an idiot too.  Stop playing with mommy's 'puter.

,Olphus,2008-01-11T20:01Z,"wtf, when I try to download I get a video 700mb file called The Evil Below??
Can someone check?"
,Jerk990,2008-01-12T23:02Z,Stop telling everyone how leopard broke your PC if your too stupid to run it on a pc then go buy a mac and shut the fuck up
,bizzyb0t,2008-01-15T11:05Z,"@Jerk990

Thanks, that made me LOL.

This version of Parallels works great! The serial someone posted was accepted with no problems. I love this program, it makes using Windows fun again. "
,marcus_mark,2008-01-16T10:51Z,"Downloaded and got it installed without a single problem. Thanks and keep up the good work!
Always glad making the choice of swtching from Win to Mac."
,genesisDK,2008-01-18T12:26Z,Works great for me! Thanks a bunch!

,Macboyleopard,2008-03-17T21:15Z,does this work on a power book G4 without intel but with leopard???
,caseyw,2008-09-12T00:51Z,Thanks. I got a iso image for XP too. Hope it works. I'm guessing I can use my external Hard Drive with this.
,caseyw,2008-09-12T00:55Z,"I'll tell you though, definitely needs more seeding."
,caseyw,2008-09-12T00:57Z,"I'm getting a constant 0.1 kb/s with little change. Still, thanks."
,caseyw,2008-09-12T00:58Z,"@kokonradXD

Look for a torrent called 'Stripped XP.sitx'. It's completely setup for launching a tiny version of windows. All ready for this build of Parallels might I add."
,caseyw,2008-09-12T00:59Z,"But seriously, seeding would be nice. I'm .05% from finishing."
