Hornblower in the West Indies is of a poorer quality. I don't recall who does the narration, but it is none of the two mentioned. Thanks a bunch. Hope it stays alive for some time for these are great books especially if you are into the whole napoleonic / navy deal. Ha-h'm. Call all hands to weigh anchor and make sail."
