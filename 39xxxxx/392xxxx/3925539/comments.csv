Therefore I had to manually edit out the long silence, which I did using the Nero editor with the appropriate plug-in, to make it fit an ordinary cd-r. "

,mojave.productions,2007-12-17T15:38Z,"I had to use nero to convert the iso file to a nrg and then used UltraISO to unpack the nrg into individual dts wav files so I could shave off the extra 2 sec from the last track using nero. (it has an extra 2 sec on it which makes it too big for a standard CD-R without overburning).  Plays fine... 

Thanks for very much for this - Sinead O'Connor on the last track is added bonus :)"
,captaink1,2008-01-11T16:52Z,"Mojave, can you detail how you converted the file in Nero?  I am having NO luck with this file and UltraISO won't touch it (calls it invalid file).  Thanks in advance..."
,Drosselschlichte,2009-03-06T06:56Z,"Am I understood it correctly - I have NO chance to play it by software, without any hw-implementations (or proprietary players like WinDVD)? Looks like DTS, Inc. doesn't share their codecs - googling doesn't help, and no stuff from codec packs seem able to play this.
A pity, then, as I have no digital hardware :(((

captaink1: Had the same problem, WinXP said ""Cannot read from the disk"" when tried to access mounted ISO. Open Nero, choose Recorder \ Burn Image..., and then flow its contents into .NRG file (write to Nero Image Recorder). This way, the resulting image becomes, at least, recognisable by system."
