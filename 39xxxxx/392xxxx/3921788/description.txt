This is by far the best recording of this wonderful mass that I have heard (and I think I've heard every recording on the market by now). The soloists do a very (and sometimes almost perfect work). The choir and orchestra are excellent (as always) and the tempi seem to be right . I would really recommend this recording to everyone that would like to have this mass and also to everyone that would like to know a very pleasing recording of one of Haydn's most wonderful works!
