[T],spotswood,2008-02-21T09:40Z,"?Elements of Life? not only became a huge hit, but was also recently nominated for a Grammy. That's why Tiesto is the best DJ.  Also top notch on the DJ Mag top 100! undeniably the best.  this sat (23rd of Feb) he will be leading the party at the annual ""Trance Energy"" mega party (30,000 strong) in The Netherlands.  If somebody can put that vid up will get his dick sucked!"
