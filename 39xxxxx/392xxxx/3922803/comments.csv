,judasmyguide,2007-12-11T14:19Z,Oh its for fsx i see.. is it compatible with fs2004? Is there any military traffic out for fs2004 beside tantris?
,judasmyguide,2007-12-12T13:39Z,"I visited Just Flight's website and found the following: 

System Requirements

Flight Simulator X or Flight Simulator 2004 
Pentium IV 1.7GHz PC equivalent or higher 
512Mb RAM 
64Mb DirectX 8.1 graphics card for FS9 (64Mb DirectX 9.0c graphics card for FSX) 
Windows 2000/XP 
400Mb hard drive space

So I asume that its for fs2004 as well :-)"
