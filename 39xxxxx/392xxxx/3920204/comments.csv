,hdemiurge,2007-12-04T07:22Z,"Many many many many Thanks to you guys at DCP. I got back into comics because of you guys. And i not only DL, but i actually buy the books too. What the big two are doing is exactly like what the Music industry is doing: not listening to the customers and/or refusing to work with them."

,dingbatty,2007-12-04T08:50Z,It's cool to see Gargoyles in the pack.  Is there anyone out there with any of the other slave labor graphics Disney stuff like Wonderland or Haunted Mansion?

,boilingpointuk,2007-12-06T18:29Z,"I see some numpty has hacked DCPSearch
How stupid do you get... I tell you these so called hackers should be hung up by their buster browns and tared and feathered.
Anyone know if DCPSearch has a mirror site?

p.s. Thanks to PirateBay for supplying DCP when all around are bending to the law."
,fpoitr,2007-12-06T20:21Z,"Stay way from any Ori - DCP. Their always bunk. You get the comic cover and the next page is a screen shot from the zombie in Pet Semetary, with a  junk message "" Like it, Buy it!"" Get off your soapbox buddy. "
