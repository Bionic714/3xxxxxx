,Ultron,2008-02-15T12:55Z,"Anyone else having trouble running this on Vista? It runs, but its extremely choppy and pretty much impossible to play. Anyone know how to fix this?"
,poelman,2008-02-18T22:08Z,"Im new at this, i got it full 100% what do i need to do now?"
,Schwinus,2008-05-01T20:02Z,"ultron: you may have to right click the .exe-icon and choose compadability settings. Dunno if thats the correct term, but that's how you do it i figure."
,Schwinus,2008-05-01T20:08Z,"ultron: i take it back, its a fucking piece of shit that doesnt work. If anyone comes up with a solution, please inform me. Or at best, seed the other torrents with this game - hopefully one will work!"

,iiiratep,2010-03-09T15:04Z,"Doesn't work under Win7, even with all sorts of compatibility settings. Graphics are extremely laggy, sound is choppy and colors are all messed up. Shutting down explorer.exe fixes the color problem I think, but the game is still unplayable. Better keep an XP partition around for games like these. :)"
,jackppp,2010-05-08T22:47Z,"To everyone having trouble playing this due to lags/sound problems:
DISABLE YOUR DIRECT 3D ACCELERATION.
Open->dxdiag"
