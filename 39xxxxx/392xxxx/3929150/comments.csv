,AbuHol,2007-12-13T18:35Z,Video and audio quality is excellent.  10/10.  And the movie is a great kidnapping thriller which actually keeps you guessing each minute as the plot thickens.  Lot of suspense and twists in this film.  Worth watching in my opinion.  Glad I downloaded it.
,BigDickBubba,2007-12-15T06:38Z,"this movie sucks ! 

it's so fake. no one would drive around with the childs kidnapper and not attack them or call the cops !   

all they had to do was attack Pierce Brosnan and take his cell phone so he couldn't call the lady who was holding the kid. pffft ! how hard is that ? 


instead they watch their lives get ruined ?? this movie sucks I could only watch 30 minutes before I had to turn it off because even for Hollywood it was too fake. "
