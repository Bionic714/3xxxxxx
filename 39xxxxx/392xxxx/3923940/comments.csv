,Dan7712,2007-12-06T21:05Z,What's the quality like on this?
,daffy14,2007-12-06T21:18Z,Thanks M8
,Dan7712,2007-12-06T21:32Z,"*Based on cam quality*

Audio: 6.5 / 10 - Not the best a bit muffled but is alright for a cam.

Video: 7/10 - Not the best I have seen but is watchable.

Worth the download. Probs going to be one of the best quality copies for awhile."
,pilkjaer,2007-12-06T22:01Z,"quality suxx!

,MONEYOVERBIITCHES,2007-12-08T00:41Z,When does this movie with swe sub and Good qvalitet come out ?... 2-3 weeks ?
,thadinator,2007-12-08T05:19Z,"the sound is slightly muttled, and the video a bit grainy. some of the film appears to be cropped out. But for a pre-release copy it can't be beat. I will seed this one for awhile."
,notrelevant,2007-12-08T08:50Z,"Thank You very much! This IS the correct movie, it IS NOT passworded, and it downloaded fairly fast (less than 4 Â˝ hours). I only skipped through it so far, but it seems complete except for the credits, which given that it is a cam recording is quite normal. While the quality is not that of a DVD, (who would realistically expect that it was?) it is quite watchable. Now I have to keep seeding for at least 500Mb to get my ratio up to 1, so come and get it please.
In conclusion, it was everything I'd hoped for with no problems, so once again THANK YOU! to HeOn."
,ask412,2007-12-09T00:41Z,poor quality. Looks like a hand held camera version from the Bali market stalls. But it is early days! No complaints.
,michaelrwatson,2007-12-09T04:19Z,"Download this sucker and then try the following:  get a hold of virtualdub (a great open source video editing program) as well as the deflicker, fx deghost, and unsharp mask filters, then re-export this thing adding the filters in this order:
1. unsharp mask
2. de-ghost
3. resize to 484x260
4. crop to 480x256
5. deflicker
6. unsharp mask again (less strong)
7. up the saturation and brightness a bit

You have to play around with the settings, but you will end up with a video that is noticeably better quality. If only the cammer had done all that.  Oh yeah, also add a highpass filter to the audio (cutoff at 25 Hz) to remove some of the low base/echoes. Virtualdub does this. 

Hey, there's a foot of snow on the ground here and i'm bored outta my skull."
,michaelrwatson,2007-12-09T06:02Z,"WHOOPS.... NEVER MIND. The dumbfucks who cammed this piece of shite cut off the subtitles. They're spekin Norwegian (or something) in parts--obviously key to the plot. Thanks mVs, you pathetic dumbasses."
,ZZ_00_ZZ,2007-12-11T20:57Z,Looking at comments and screenshots i think i'll wait until someone brings out a good one....
,marlicone,2007-12-12T13:29Z,"English subtitle for this release @ MoTechSubs:

,michaelrwatson,2007-12-14T02:44Z,"Um, thanks, but those are subtitles for the WHOLE movie. Who wants to be reading English subtitles *while they're speakin English*...? 

You only want them for the Norwegian parts. duh."
,gurgel,2007-12-31T16:35Z,michael: We - who are hearing impaired - do.
,kermitblink,2008-01-01T21:39Z,"thanx anyway ill seed but the quality isnt good enough for me , really fast torrent it took less than an hour ."
,kelvin01,2008-01-02T17:12Z,"OMFG SEED THIS BITCH. SEED IT.

,xjuliiax,2008-01-04T14:18Z,"I need this movie in high quality, can sum1 tell me the quality, not based on cam ?"
