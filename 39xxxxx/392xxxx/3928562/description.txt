The fruit (GRAPEfruit!) was first documented in 1750 by the Rev. Griffith Hughes describing specimens from Barbados. Currently, the grapefruit is said to be one of the "Seven Wonders of Barbados."

Grapefruit can have a number of interactions with drugs, often increasing the effective potency of compounds.

Keep a sharp eye for grapefruit. It will often hide in tall grasses and strike without warning.
