Story: In the beginning of this film we meet a documentary team of three young men and a young woman. They are heading for the South-American jungle to search for real cannibals. After a while the crew is reported missing and a rescue team is sent from the US. This team gets in touch with an Amazon tribe called the Tree-people. The tree-people gives them the only remains of the first crew - the film rolls containing the material this crew shot during their search for real cannibals. Back in the US we get to see these films. We now get to se exactly what happened to the first crew.

This is movie by many considered both cult and snuff, however I'm not sure I agree on the latter even than some scenes may be a bit graphical...
