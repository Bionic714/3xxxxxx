Tarantinoesque thriller ZERO features three intersecting storylines that take
place over the course of a single day. In the first, a down-on-his-luck
undertaker appears to have dug himself into an early grave when he gambles
everything away at a casino and cannot afford to repay his debts. Meanwhile, a
sexually-frustrated soldier goes AWOL from the army, hoping to find his
girlfriend and satisfy his libidinous urges. The third storyline involves a
gang of carjackers whose insatiable drug-lust is the only thing that drives
them to a life of crime. Inevitably, all three stories collide with explosive
results.
