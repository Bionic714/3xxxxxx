,tgsf2012,2011-10-16T12:56Z,"Lol, 6.66GB its a Devil File!"
,michaelrwatson,2011-12-21T07:18Z,"Why is this only 6.66 GB while the other torrent is 7.51 GB?? They both say OS X 10.5... See:

,stevenone,2012-02-06T11:46Z,"If you dont want to burn it on disk, and use Image restore from Disk Utility, you must try to convert the ISO into a DMG.
you can try using this DMG converter, for example: http://sunsky3s.s41.xrea.com/dmgconverter/index.html"
,Mr.Buddha,2012-04-16T02:41Z,"Unfortunately this file is 7.5GB not 6.66
This was just barely too large to fit on my 8gb NANO that I was using to install this on a macbook pro... & an 8GB thumb drive I just purchased only had 7.25, gay! "
,Mr.Buddha,2012-04-16T02:46Z,Does anyone know if I can maybe get rid of some of the packages in the optional install folder?
