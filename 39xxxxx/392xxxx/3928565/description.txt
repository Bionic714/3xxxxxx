"Tim Wilson is "a wonderful" artist to see live, his performance is something you will never forget. Shy at first, as the show progress's on he becomes more friendly, just like his songs. Starting off as something very simple, and progress within a short period of time to something beautiful and nothing short of genius.

His most recent release Uncorked Understandings was a progression from his previous release, a split with local The Salt. My suggestion for listening from that CD is the whole CD from start to finish.... in one word, beautiful."
