,bamboomba,2008-01-24T18:33Z,get an error during last mission loading script error? any advice
,Shaz!,2008-02-18T00:05Z,"@MiszAnne

i haven't had a look at the files... but i think you might have to access the image file using some virtual drive software like daemon tools or alcohol soft, etc.
Usually the file types are iso, cso, img, etc.

Hope helps somewhat"
,PhreedomX,2008-05-03T14:31Z,"Installation went smoothly and copied the crack over the original .exe and .dir files as per normal but when I try to play, a first error pops up -

Entry Point Not Found
binkw32.dll 

This pops up twice. Then it continues to load the game but I get stuck again before the intro even launches with ANOTHER error box popup - 

Director Player Error
Object Expected

And it just keeps popping up even if I click Ok or Cancel.

I Googled this issue quite a bit and it seems to be a rampant bug or perhaps incompatibility with my video card (256MB nVidia GeForce 7800GTX). 

Either the torrent files were incomplete in the first place or it's a bug that Ubisoft has yet to address since even their patch WEBSITE is down so it looks pretty dim now.

Try your luck and see how it goes for you guys but I've surveyed several CSI games forums and it's all the same. 

Was really looking forward to playing this one. Hope a crew like RELOADED or RAZOR1911 will upload a more reliable torrent in the future.

,PhreedomX,2008-05-03T15:05Z,"SOLVED THE ISSUE! 

I copied the binkw32.dll file from my CSI 4: Hard Evidence folder on my PC and pasted it in this folder -

C:\CSI Miami\xtras\Licensed\

and replaced the original binkw32.dll which came with the installation. 

Works fine now. Can anyone reseed the first CSI game and CSI: Dark Motives please?"

,xiIix,2009-07-14T18:59Z,"Chances are you still have CD2 or 3 mounted. You probably need CD1 mounted for the game to work.

Seriously guys, I've never seen so many new people having so much trouble learning how to download illegally.

All you do is mount the cd images with daemon tools. Then you install the game, when it asks for another cd you just mount that one and click ok. After that you throw the crack in whatever directory you installed the game in. Screw where the instructions are telling you to put it, just find where the game was installed, and replace the main executable.

And also try to Google things before you ask them here, or you might find yourself getting flamed. Even I'm not usually this nice."
,LIZAKEY04,2009-10-14T14:55Z,"have downloaded this game from 2 different torrents, and its the same result, it will play the background music, but you can not hear the characters talk.
