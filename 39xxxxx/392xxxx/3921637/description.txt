MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. 125 Never-Never Affair
The innocent this time is Mandy Stevenson (Barbara Feldon), an UNCLE translator who yearns for excitement. NS sends her on a fictious mission (in reality she's getting Waverly more pipe tobacco). By mistake, she's given a microdot with key information about Thrush. French Thrush leader Victor Gervais (Cesar Romero) is in hot pursuit.
