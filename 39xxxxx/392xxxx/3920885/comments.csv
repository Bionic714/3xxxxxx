,DR_ZAXXON,2008-10-30T14:45Z,"Hello, Sorry for the long delay I am seeding all my sets again , however I will need some good dedicated seeders to help push the songs around.  I have seen some comments / questions regarding the sets.  I would like to re-irradiate that this is my collection I have toted with me and picked up many songs from different sources.  I personally recorded a few but mostly are not my recording.  I have noticed there are a couple of songs duplicated in some of the years.  I guess they re played them at a later date to fill air time.  I do not have a good depth of knowledge regarding to the history and set up and such.  Im just a fan who enjoys the different mixes. (In fact there are many I have not even listened to yet).  So please enjoy and seed.  I m looking for all of 2008 and 2006.  ICQ @ 2144080 if you can help!"

,fnagelsc,2012-04-18T05:35Z,"I downloaded this to get the David Holmes 1997-06-15 mix (which is amazing btw), however i encountered 2 issues (one very strange).  

Firstly, it is not the entire mix.  
Secondly, it says it is 1h33m34s long however the music actually goes ona couple of minutes from there.

I love this mix and was intending to split the songs and re-post it so f I could somehow get the full mix it would be AwESoMe"
