CoBall is a simple puzzle game in which the aim is to make all the balls dissapear. By matching three or more balls of the same colour together, you eliminate those balls. 

This can be quite challenging, since you don't get to pick what colour ball you get. The gameplay is quite similar to other popular titles such as bust-a-move.
