E.g. if I try to open Install_USB.txt by double-clicking in Windows Explorer, Windows Explorer crashes. Same happens if I mount the ISO using Demon Tools. I'm on Win XP Home."

Try re-downloading and re-burning."
,daddycakes242,2008-01-15T10:58Z,"I tried mounting the ISO with MagicISO and it came up with Setup being an invalid Win32 Application.

Can you try reripping the CD with Winimage or something?"
