,julleost,2007-12-06T07:26Z,alltså varför ladda upp detta sååå jäkla onödig sak då man kan använda hotswap för att softmodda sin box. ladda ner xplorer360 installera. sätt xbox1 konsolen vid datorn  starta upp xboxen  presis då man får microsoft loggan drar man ur ide kabeln från hd i xboxen och kopplar den i datorn och kör xplorer360 så full tillgång till hela xbox hd bara kopiera dashboard  till den osv
,haggvik,2007-12-07T15:48Z,"I'll translate for you hermy_productions:

Why upload such an unecessary thing when you can use hotswap to softmod your xbox. Download xplorer360 and install it. Put the Xbox1 console next to the computer and start it up, and just when you get the Microsoft logo, you pull the IDE cable out from the Xbox, plug it into the computer, run xplorer360 and you'll have full access to the whole Xbox HD, just copy it to the dashboard and so on."
,unrar,2007-12-07T23:07Z,"i am a modder with more than 3 years experience. this is by far the easiest, safest mod i have ever found. hotswaps are inherantly very dangerous. even a tsop flash or installing a mod chip are pretty dangerous to someone who is unexperienced. this is very straightforward. copy this gamesave to an xbox memory card using a modified xbox or connect an xbox controller to a pc and use the action replay software. you then copy this gamesave to the xbox's hard drive, insert the mechassault disc, and load the hacked gamesave from the campaign menu. from there on a small child could figure this out. for someone with a lot of experience this might be ""unecessary"", but it still makes modding a lot easier for me. you don't even have to open the box, leaving you free to remove the softmod at any time and still be able to sell the xbox anywhere. most shops will not buy consoles that have been opened."
,unrar,2007-12-10T03:42Z,"I think this exploit does not have the clock loop problem you talked about. i've heard of it before, but i've never seen it. I've used this on countless boxes. works great on all versions. And all of my uploads are coming directly from ""the source"". I just wanted to share with this community too."
,haggvik,2007-12-14T16:36Z,Does this work with 1.6 machines?
,unrar,2007-12-22T23:03Z,yes! this mod works on all versions!
,Electronburn,2008-05-06T01:39Z,Do i need the game to get this to work?
,punkfreak73,2008-06-30T04:05Z,"what is ""the source""  lol"
,Idelpenquin,2009-01-06T23:30Z,"I know about splinter cell, mechassault and 007 A.U.F but are there any other games you can do it with i don't have any of those :( 

and also i have modded a controller to use a usb stick as memory but i cant seem to get saves from the comp tried modding AR to work like some of the tutorials say and tried ozXmemory but that just takes up space and renames the memory chip! plz any help would be appreciated"
