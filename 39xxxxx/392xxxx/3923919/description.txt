"OH SCHUCKS... HERE COMES UNTAG!" is Leon Schuster's first full-length comedy and tells the story of Kwagga Robertse, a rugged bachelor farmer living in the fictitious African country Nambabwe. The film boasts a bit of romance some action and adventure and lots and lots of that beloved Schuster humour - though this time in a more polished and sophisticated version.
