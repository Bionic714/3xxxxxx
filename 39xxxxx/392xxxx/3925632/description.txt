JLA: The Nail is a three-issue comic book limited series published by DC Comics. It is a self-contained story by Alan Davis which stands outside of the mainstream continuity. In this universe, the truck of Martha and Jonathan Kent has a tire puncture which is caused by a nail. This prevents them from discovering the spaceship containing the baby Kal-El, and so, there is no Superman.

The theme of the story is set by its first paragraph:

For want of a nail the shoe was lost,
for want of a shoe the horse was lost,
for want of a horse the knight was lost,
for want of a knight the battle was lost.
So it was a kingdom was lost - all for want of a nail.
