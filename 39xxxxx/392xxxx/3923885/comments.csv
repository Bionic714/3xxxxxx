,anothergoofyone,2008-01-20T04:13Z,"this is very simple to load onto your psp. 
first you need to format your card
step 1  save file (iso game) on your desktop
step 2  sync your psp up to your computer by using your usb connection Or by directly inserting memory card into card port on computer
step 3 drag file/game to your memory card in PSP/ISO
then disconnect and launch the storage card on your psp and start the game. HOPE THAT HELPS"
,kebabman86,2008-01-21T02:56Z,"Thanks to anothergoofyone for the answer --- Ok, so i did evrything you said. I connected my psp, and i got to the ""D"", then i went in to ""PsP"" but there was no map called ""ISO"" so i created one, then i draged the winrar file into it, but it does not work. My firmware version is ""3.71 m33.2"" (a company installed it for me for 30 bucks becouse i was to nooblet and bricked my psp when i was trying to hack it xD) So, what is wrong? Do i need to unrar some file, or is the firmware version fucked up? Anyone got a tip? Would be extremly helpful, been tyring for hours without succes >< Thanks in advance!"
,edo08,2008-03-02T00:39Z,"i also have custom firmware 3.71 m33 on the psp slim and had the same problem but i found out it was the memory card that was fuking things up because the memory card i bought was second hand and had been formated from a pc, so then i formated it from my psp and tryed again and it worked."
,edo08,2008-03-10T23:57Z,"your supposed to unzip the file and then copy to your iso folder, a hacked psp can run isos and csos."
,edo08,2008-03-11T03:02Z,when i get to the new campaign menu and press on veteran or any difficulty the psp just freezes and then shuts off. i am running on fw 3.90 m33-2 and all isos should work on this fw so i think it is a bad download.
,edo08,2008-03-11T16:00Z,anothergoofyone is a goof and your downloads are s**t.
,conager,2008-03-14T00:24Z,will it work on firmware 1.0 or 1.5 work plz answer
,anothergoofyone,2008-03-27T17:53Z,"certainly I don't want a bad torrent, Ican't understand why so many are having problems with this. today is 03/22/2008 i'll repost another torrent and remove this. My apologies to all who have had trouble with this file."
,Pro_Pirate,2008-04-01T18:47Z,"you have to put the iso file in x:/ISO/xxxxx
x is the folder of the memory stick.
You must have custom firmware.
Firmwares 1.0 and 1.5 use eboot which is not included in this download."
,daemonen,2008-08-18T01:48Z,"To play this game on your PSP, you must have a custom firmware. In my case I have a 4.01 m33-2. Then connect your PSP to your computer and put on USB mode. Check if you have a ISO folder on your root directory on your memory stick. If you dont see any ISO folder, you need to format your memory stick from your PSP. If you have now the ISO folder on the root directory on memory stick, copy the file onto ISO folder then back to PSP. If you got an error message, here's the trick. Press hold on SELECT button on you PSP and you will see a MENU. M33 VSH MENU. Under the UMD ISO MODE, you need to set to M33 driver, then exit. Now you can play ISO file on your PSP now. Hope this will solve your problem."
,Cross_the_border731,2008-08-25T00:32Z,"to play on psp,
extract the iso/cso.
copy the file to the ""\ISO\"" folder on the root of the psp.

You can try daemonen's select but if you dont have that menu (versions b 4 3.71 m33)
now, hold the ""R"" button (right rear button) and turn on the PSP.
a screen should come up with the title ""M33 Recovery Menu"".
go to ""Configuration"", and change the setting ""UMD Mode"" to ""M33 driver -NO UMD-"" with the ""X"" button.
select ""back"", then ""exit"".

Go to the memory stick under ""Game"".
The game should now come up. "
