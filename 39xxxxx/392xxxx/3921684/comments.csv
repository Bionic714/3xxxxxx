[V],dohduhdah,2008-01-03T06:00Z,"Yeah, it's always a hassle to obtain the proper codecs for video. Try a different player... usually there is some player that will play back the files properly. I suggest trying out videolan, bs player pro or nero showtime. Otherwise you will have to find the proper codecs for your favorite player. They can be downloaded online sometimes or sometimes you can obtain a packages of codecs on p2p."

,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:22Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.
