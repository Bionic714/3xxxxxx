,hectorbandido,2008-01-01T13:58Z,"Subzero,

Thanks for the download. Similar to Masterboro's comments after I clicked on the launcher.exe file, I attempted to run the fifa08.exe but am receiving the rror that it did not install properly and to try again. Tried to run a few times but always receiving the same error message.

Any obvious ideas other than having to uninstall and try again?

Best regards."

I am having a BIG problem with the launcher.exe file. I have unrar the fifa08 with winrar and 7zip (which is 100% ok) and from that point nothing works. As subzero! said

2.: double click: launcher.exe ( must be done 1st )

I HAVE double clicked it and it gives me this message 
* Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item. *

I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I HAVE DONE WRONG!!! All my specs are ok for the game and i have alot of HD space! Can YOU subzero! plz help me out or anyone else. I would be really greatfull!"
