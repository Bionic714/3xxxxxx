"This is sort of the last of an era before Tinyfolk turned into the bastard mutant it is today.

These are rainy-day pop songs and the production is all pretty rough and lo-fi (though nowhere near as lo-fi as my early early tape stuff. if you want to hear it, send me an e-mail at tinyfolk[at]gmaildotcom and i'll send some to you).

There are some nice guest spots by Tony Presley of Real Live Tigers, Adam Coppess of Jenny is a Boy and Meghan Lamb of Iron Like Nylon, who was more or less a full-fledged member of Tinyfolk when this one came out."
