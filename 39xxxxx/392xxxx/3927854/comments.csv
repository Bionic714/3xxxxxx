,zkalos,2007-12-10T14:57Z,"Thx , but not all working for me. In the cockpit displays not alphabets and numbers, but the plane can fly. Voronoi.dat problem ? Help me if you can."
,rhadamantys,2007-12-11T23:03Z,"Hello! La france en force sur les torrents ;-)

Sinon, anybody k,now if this fucking version of PSS 757 reslved the fucking problem of very poor FPS! Because PSS make a the biggest FPS Killer! It is the worst nightmare for my FS. Thus PSS defeated PMDG with their fucking 737 great FPS eater too!

Well I hope PSS guy's make something to increase FPS like a very good Level D 767!"
,zkalos,2007-12-13T19:43Z,"Help me please.
On the FMS and all panel CRT screens not seen  numbers, caracters and letters, nothing.The dials working.Any idea? I installed older v1.2, and the result black screen too, but the plane can fly perfectly. The two fonts are in the perfect place in the Windows\Font mappa."
,artkor3,2007-12-14T01:32Z,to zkalos: My be placed fonts into FS9-folder?... I have folder Fonts in FS9 folder ( :\FS9\Fonts\[here Baloo.ttf & IRS__.ttf])... Work perfectl...
,zkalos,2007-12-15T11:12Z,"Sorry, but not working again. I put the fonts to the good place and nothing. I shall install other pss boeing(B777). Maybe I have other problem  with my system.With other addons i have not problems.
Thanx"
,zkalos,2007-12-15T15:27Z,"THX to arthor3!
It works perfectly now. I installed the old v1.1, and uninstall it. Install this v1.3 and works. I dont understand why, but everything OK now. The framerate a little better or equal than PMDG B747. Again thank you!"
,B737NGW,2007-12-15T21:20Z,"Works great, thanks! :)

REQ: v1.3 liveries"
,Capt.Jambo,2007-12-20T22:47Z,"Hi, does anyone know what's the difference between this one and the 1.2 version?"
,airman123,2008-01-17T15:54Z,"If you have downloaded this torrent, then you have helped put PSS out of buissness. That means they will make no more addons. For proof, go to ""http://www.phoenix-simulation.co.uk"" and see for your self. I hope your happy!"
,Panodilo,2008-01-19T11:56Z,Their demise is not because of The Pirate Bay. It's because they suck at running a business. If PSS built real 757s they would be falling out of the sky six times before lunch every day. You don't sell unfinished products to people.
,a380person,2008-02-11T21:25Z,Thanks u ppl downloadin fukn torrents of pss aircraft have put a fuking great flight sim developer out of buisiness thanks u seedin bastards
,SIG_550,2008-02-23T02:46Z,to a380person: u're welcome :)  here's a piece of advice 4 ya: Why don't you try sticking your head up your ass? See if it fits. And  f*ck off 
,SIG_550,2008-02-23T02:47Z,"Blaming TPB for it sounds all to easy, doesn't it? Piracy is one thing......

pricing policy, upgrading, etc another ........."
,yeoldecaptain,2008-04-02T18:03Z,"airman123 and a380person (both of which are NOT real pilots in real life - nice usernames)

**chuckles** Yeah . . . . Okay, kids.  So if you are so anti-pirate, why the fuck are you trolling around the Pirate Bay?  OH!  Wait . . . . You are one of those hypocrites that came HERE to download your product because PSS went out of business WITHOUT notice and refused to give their customers ANY chance at al to FTP their product for backup before just ripping down their site.  But you want to justify YOUR form of piracy by leaving a comment slamming other pirates.

By the way -- it's on record that you downloaded the torrent, too, so you WILL (and his IS an order from a Captain) learn to do the following:

-->Quit being a hypocrite

-->Learn some grammar (such as the VERY obvious difference between ""your"" and ""you're"" that they teach in grade school -- you know -- the school you dropped out of).

-->As another poster suggested on one of the many torrents you posted on: ""Shove your head up your ass"" (Note that THIS is the proper use of ""your"").  This will make it a bit easier to kick you off the plank.  **laughs at you**

And, yes, I do have time to copy/paste this to you in a few of the torrents you commented (AND downloaded) because I, too, am downloading these files which I legally paid for thru PSS and rudely found out I have no access to after a hard drive reformat.

**shrug** I am guilty of not backing the files up to a CD or source separate from my computer.  But, hey, thanks to P2P clients and sites like the Pirate Bay, pirate or not, we legal users can now rectify this situation.

Have fun playing with your downloaded files while blaming others for your own guilt, hypocrite, kids."
,yeoldecaptain,2008-04-02T18:18Z,"AH!  I forgot to mention a big THANK YOU to those of you sharing these files for those of us to back up.  I don?t care about pirate status or not ? it?s awesome to be able to get these files after they conveniently disappeared from the server without notice.  PSS was still in their legal right to stop trading without notice, but it was bad business practice and it is guaranteed that if the ever go back into business, such shady business practice history will fuel pirates even more.  Sorry, PSS, but that?s sad when you don?t at least give notice and force customers to go to P2P sites to get their files.  The proper way to do it would have been:

Send an email:

?Hey, sorry, we?re going out of business in ? say ? 1 week.  Please log into your accounts and you will now find an FTP RAR (or ZIP if they are that cheap) copy of your files to download for a proper backup.  We apologize for the inconvenience.?"
,yeoldecaptain,2008-04-02T18:19Z,"Okay -- not sure why TPB converted my quote marks to question marks, so I apologize to other readers if this post looks funny O.O"
,yeoldecaptain,2008-04-02T18:32Z,"OH!!!  And a380person . . . uhm . . . . you say here:

""Thanks u ppl downloadin fukn torrents of pss aircraft have put a fuking great flight sim developer out of buisiness thanks u seedin bastards""

Yet at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3508758/FS2004_-_Pss_Airbus_a320_v2.zip you say this:

""panel does not work correctly
when i switch to vfr panel there is a big red square where the center post is to be
REQUEST Just Flight A340-500/600""

So . . . . like airmn123 you downloaded the files from these torrents yet chew us out for sharing.  Hmmm. . . . "
,a380person,2008-06-19T20:56Z,"Hey, i used to have that before PSS Went out of buisiness and also i apologize for anything ive said, I LOVE THIS SITE!!!!!!!!"
,CorruptDictator,2008-07-16T21:49Z,To all who are experiencing display issues due to missing fonts. They have to be placed in the 'FS9\Fonts' folder AS WELL AS 'C:\Windows\Fonts' And yes this one does seem like a huge FPS improvement over version 1.
,a380person,2008-08-04T00:58Z,"NOTE. to ALL seeders AND downloaders, be careful as from a while ago there will have been a threat about torrent downloading, be careful, luckily i havent been caught yet ;)

just be careful TPB Simmers

Also, i hope the ban over torrents blows over and we can download freely, like i always do, its like my life
i love FS2004+FSX and TB , best things out ATM!"
,a380person,2008-08-04T00:58Z,i was meant to say TPB

,skyglider777,2010-11-17T23:34Z,"Thanx for the torrent!
This worked for me: you have to put the 2 files Balo&IRS(u can get them at JustFlight) in the front file like this:To add a new font to your computer using Windows XP:

   1. Click the Start button.
   2. On the Start menu, click Control Panel.
   3. In Category view, click Appearance and Themes and then click Fonts in the See Also list at the left side of the window. (If your computer is set to use Classic View, simply click Fonts in the Control Panel window.)
   4. On the File menu, click Install New Font. The Add Fonts window will open, displaying a list of fonts and a list of drives from which you can select fonts to add.
cheers:)"
