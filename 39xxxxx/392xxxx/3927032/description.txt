RIHANNA - GOOD GIRL GONE BAD, album released UK June 4th 2007.
Encoded 128Kbps [Lame] mp3. Covers included.
Good Girl Gone Bad is the third album from Barbadian RnB singer Rihanna. Featuring guest production from the likes of Timbaland and Stargate, the album sees Rihanna go for a more up tempo sound while keeping her soulful edge. Guest vocals come from the likes of Justin Timberlake, label mate Ne-Yo, Timbaland and Jay-Z. The single Umbrella is also included, together with the UK bonus track Cry.

This album has a different feel from her other albums, maybe a bit more mature and even angry sounding sometimes. She mixes her great ballads and upbeat caribbean beat together for most of the time, to create exotic and emotional songs.
