,yiucycle,2007-12-30T02:35Z,i don't see volume 5 in the video.  all i see on the menu is 1-4 volume but no volume 5.  please let me know how to access the volume 5.  also thanks for uploading the video
,rob472uk,2007-12-30T12:18Z,"At the bottom left is a next page icon on the menu click that and the screen changes to show 5 & 6 Although whoever mastered this got it wrong as they re lable themselves 1 & 2 on that page. 


Anyhow 6 doesn't work. dont bother trying cus its not on the disk as it was corupted in the version I got so I didn't put it on. But I couldn't do anything with for the menu so it is still there. However 6 is here on another thread so its no big problem."
,rob472uk,2007-12-30T12:20Z,Scratch that. I'm still hungover. I meant right not left on the video menu.

,rob472uk,2008-02-18T20:08Z,"It's an ISO format guys, get something like nero and burn it as an image to a disk.

Or...get iso magic and mount it as a volume.

Both software packages are on here so have a quick search about."
,erikdrol,2008-03-15T22:33Z,"Hey
Okay, I've tried everything.
I mounted it with both Magic ISO and DAEMON Tools.
I tried playing it with Windows Media Player, I tried ripping it with something I found and that said ""No titles found.""
Nothing worked :(
Help me please!"
