Kai Tracid - 4 Just 1 Day

For just one day
I wanna ignore our senseless fate,
Colours are victorious over the grey,
Stop to get controlled by the state.

For just one day
I wanna forget the value of money and gold,
I wanna live my way
And lose my inhibition threshold

For just one day
I wanna break all regoulations,
Because we all go the same way,
And we all pass the same stations.

For just one day
I wanna feel totally free,
No responsabilities,
Just everything is O.K.

No desires,
Just surviving is the key

Surviving is the key
Surviving is the key
Surviving is the key

For just one day...
