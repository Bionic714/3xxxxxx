This movie is shocking great if you got the right humour and a strong stomach. There are some horrible scenes so don?t use this movie as a baby sitter. Remember half of the audience left long before the end when I saw it in cinema."

,anonstuff,2008-12-04T19:44Z,"This film ""cured"" me from the ""detailed, derailed serial-killer splatter/gore""-movies.

I saw this one in a movie theatre when it came out. The disturbing thing about this movie, is that the main-character is insanely funny. The viewers were laughing hysterically in the beginning (me too), but it slowly went from full laughter, to an occasional laugh, to silence, to people shouting out their disgust, to people leaving...

After we left (I was there with a friend), we didn't talk for hours, we simply couldn't, we were too ""shocked"".

Remember, this is a ""very long time"" ago, and may be quite ""tame"" compared to recent movies, but this is an obvious classic, and very influential btw, Quentin Tarantino used this Belgian film-school students movie as a framework for ""Reservoir Dogs"". Think ""Reservoir Dogs"" with a funny serial-killer.

It cured me from wanting to see movies like ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"", I'm glad I can't laugh about those kind of graphic perversions, I'm glad I have some sort of ""stomach"" feeling that makes me NOT want to wallow in ""shit"", so I owe the makers of this movie a lot.

See this one, be disgusted, and may it cure you for all from the ""it's really not funny if you come to think about it, and you're not a tough cookie either if you can take it without feeling disgusted""

I can recommend this one as a ""shock-therapy"" for your children (If you want to be rough on them) ;-)"
