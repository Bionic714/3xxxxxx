Very interesting 3rd release from Swedish rockers Dream Evil. Being a big fan of the band, this CD marks one of the hardest driving albums they have done to date. Very catchy chorus lines, very well-crafted songwriting, and all around great guitar work. The vocals are almost David Coverdale (Whitesnake) or Bruce Dickinson (Iron Maiden) style. Very opretic in tone and can handle the drive that the music brings behind it. Good CD for the headbanger at heart. The catchiest song on the CD is "No Way", which just is out of the gate from the get go.
