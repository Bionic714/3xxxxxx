Hundreds of suburban house plans.  This is my first torrent :)  Bought these on Ebay and its my pleasure to share them to everyone!  I promise there is no password.

There are 2,740 \".DWG\" files in 1.54GB once extracted.  Be sure you have AutoCAD or a DWG viewer to use these.

Favorites of the bunch are numbers:
133
228
358
401 - Without a doubt the most complete and largest house.

Some of these are complete sets while others appear to not be.  I didn\'t tamper with any of the files.

I will seed for as long as I can (perhaps a few months, almost full time) but my max upload speed seems to never cross 120kb/s so be patient and help seed please.

Educational purposes only

Enjoy :)
