,grieveriix,2008-01-08T23:49Z,"Ok, first go and download the trial version game. Bigfishgames.com will have the trial to download. Install the trial version and then download the torrent.

Next where the trial version of the game was installed open that folder and copy paste the .exe file that was the torrent. And it should play great."
