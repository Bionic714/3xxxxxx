i will help you seed and not just drop off as so many ass holes here do, 

i know how they treated me when i tried to upload 8 eps of a mini series not long ago.

200% should be a start do ya think.leave it on all night i have 128 KB/s up --1024 Kb/s should get a lot more than that."
,carolinawolf,2007-12-08T03:50Z,"hasn't started as yet. where's that seed?
also half the trackers you have on this thing are not working or refusing connection.
only ones working are here at the bay, screw all the others."
,carolinawolf,2007-12-08T17:20Z,"my good friend djingen

i have now seen the client you are using,

 if you right click on the torrent you are seeding and tick properties then Initial seeding it will put you in super seed mode. 

 and this torrent will go up a lot faster.

hope this helps ya."
,carolinawolf,2007-12-08T20:50Z,"now i see this guy is trying to upload 4 torrents at this time and seems to have low bandwidth.

 i have uploaded 8 times the amount of the file almost 5 gigs. and am only at 38& .
this sucks and is stupid. I'm dropping off.

 find out how to upload.

 use super seed! if you going to try all of this at once. "
