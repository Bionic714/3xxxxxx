,douglas787,2009-02-28T17:39Z,"The torrent does have problems, such as tracks not playing from the start and other trouble, but you can listen to it. I just play everything as one long track, and it works with some minor annoyances. "
,rv_warlock,2009-03-11T11:40Z,"Force Majeure, Doro, and Calling the Wild are the only 3 correct albums.  True at Heart, Angels Never Die, Live, A Whiter Shade of Pale, Machine II Machine, Love Me in Black, and Rare Diamonds are NOT Doro or Warlock.  The rest are either Warlock or Doro, but with serious problems. 

Download at your own risk!"
