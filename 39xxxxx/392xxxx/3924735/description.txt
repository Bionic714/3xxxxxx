**I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again (1964-1973)**

Billed as 'Radio Prune,' this show starred John Cleese, Greame Garden, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Bill 
Oddie, Jo Kendall and David Hatch 

Irreverant sketch humor, post-Goon Show, pre-Monty Python. The show brought to the air silly voices, 
early shades of Python humor, mildly smutty jokes, purposely awful puns (light-heartedly booing a 
purposely bad pun would become as much a part of the show's audience participation as laughing at 
the funnier jokes). It was totally anarchic for the times. 

The show shines soley because of the talents of those present. John Cleese would later become one 
of the founding members of Monty Python's Flying Circus, also famous for the BBC-TV program Fawlty 
Towers, and is undoubtedly one of the best comedy writers and performers ever. Bill Oddie and 
Greame Garden were regular performers on the show, and wrote the scripts with contributions from 
the others. (Python-to-be Eric Idle is also sometimes mentioned in the writing credits.) Garden and 
Oddie along with Tim Brooke-Taylor would later form 'The Goodies' for BBC-TV. David Hatch was 
another regular on the show. He has gone on to become Managing Director of the BBC Network Radio.
