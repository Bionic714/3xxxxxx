if you ( everybody ) look at a torrent and it has no screenshots or link to boxcover/official info about the file  google it and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out ! dont be lazy and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself...even if you choose not to download the file it only takes a few seconds to be helpful, if we all do this we all get a better service. use imdb.com for film info & google for everything else thanks"
