,sheerliberation,2007-12-25T11:13Z,Ompalomp - maybe you simply don't have the proper .divx audio codec/splitter?
,norenore,2007-12-30T17:33Z,"Abysmal quality, especially the barely comprehensible audio. Not sure if it was encoded from a terrible source or if it's due to the fact that 2 and a half hours do not compress well to 700MB."
,international01,2008-01-01T11:26Z,I used WinAvi to convert the sample and after watching it the audio is quite poor and the video is 8/10.  I'll see if there is a better torrent.
