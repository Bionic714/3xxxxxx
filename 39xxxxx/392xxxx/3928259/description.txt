I got a Lot of Cool Music and the only thing i could fund to extract them was a software called APE Ripper...and the damn thing only allows you to use it 3 times without a valid serial number. However i used it to convenientls extract a 3 CD box set i downloaded. Buy Anyway Here it is. The Guy who uploaded this ...i want to shake his hand. His Upload file is called..Some free programs 1 and 2. And APE Ripper is a really cool software and it is , in my opinion worth buying..get it and try it...you will like it.
