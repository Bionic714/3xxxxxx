A cutesy wintery album of pop songs with a hint of a dark side (such as the morbid "a winter song") that was very much influenced by people like Dennis Driscoll and Little Wings.

Written after a bad breakup, this is really a pretty sad album, considering how poppy it is compared to the stuff I made after it. This is the last of my major "songs written about girls and relationships" era. I guess it, along with "36 songs about cats" was the first proper tinyfolk album.
