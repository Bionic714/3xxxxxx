Am now working on a project where math is essential. This is a good starting point & will go on to diff & integ calc.  Thank you."

,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:15Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.
,tbacid5,2010-11-13T02:19Z,"You know what, ""IGotDMCA"", just for your dumb remarks about receiving a letter from DMCA, I have made it a point to spread this to as many people as possible, together with all the other releases where you state the exact same dumb remark. Getting a letter from DMCA, eh? I guess, you should have refrained from giving them your address in the first place!
Btw, dohduhdah... I trust it IS your real name... and address?! :o) Thanks a million for your excellent uploads. You're top notch! "
