,rstran,2007-12-21T00:26Z,"I think that you need a modern BIOS, or these bios emulators cause your machine to not boot"
,Reeddawgy,2008-01-01T22:29Z,"So, after using the activator. Can you use windows update? I know with some of the time stopper cracks certain updates would start it up again."
,JohnDoe60914,2008-03-12T15:24Z,"It Works no doubt. Avast hates it tho hahaha. Ignore it if it comes up with trojan or virus its clean. if you remove the activation application after running it and run a virus scan ur pc is clean. I have all updates installed on vista ultimate x86 and my windows is now activated thnx man. For those of you whom it would seem it messed your PC up I would say grab your vista\xp disc and chose the repair option. If that dont work make an attempt at going into safe mode to run the app again choosing different options if that dont work grab another hdd, install a version of windows on it and save ur crap cause you'll probably need to reinstal."
,JohnDoe60914,2008-03-12T15:34Z,http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940510 This is the new update for activation hacks.I just installled it and now must restart if this activator still works I'll let u know
,JohnDoe60914,2008-03-12T15:38Z,Ok this activator is still working after the installation of the newest update designed to find activators :D
