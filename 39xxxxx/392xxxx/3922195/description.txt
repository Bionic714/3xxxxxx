                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was hoped British forces would leave Afghanistan without firing a shot, 
instead senior offices have described it as the heaviest fighting the British 
Army has seen since the Korean War and more than 50 of their men have been 
killed.

Six years after the Taliban regime fell, the south and east of the country is 
in open conflict and Britain is at the heart of the fighting. Britain has 
volunteered its troops for one of the most dangerous areas, Helmand, where the 
countryside is in the hands of the Taliban and where the rural population 
survive by growing poppies for opium.

When the BBC's Panorama first started filming in Afghanistan with The Queen's 
Company of the Grenadier Guards, it was following 35 men whose duties included 
being photographed by tourists outside Buckingham Palace. Six months later two 
are dead and thirteen others are seriously injured.

Taking on the Taliban follows The Queens Company into numerous fire fights to 
get the intimate and personal story of a small band of men facing the biggest 
challenge of their lives, and in the process, capturing unprecedented footage 
of the most intense fighting seen by the British Army since the Korean War.

And as the casualties mount, the film analyses through these men the cost of 
the fighting, what is being achieved in Afghanistan, and whether too much is 
being asked of the men on the frontline.
