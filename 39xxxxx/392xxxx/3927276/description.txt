THOSE MAGNIFICENT MEN IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES - 1965

  An air race from London to Paris provides the premise for this marvelous 

comedy, which features thrilling aerial photography and some stupefying 

stunt flying. It's set in 1910, when the (lovingly re-created) airplanes of 

the period were likelier to sputter and crash than they were to go in a 

straight line.
