,masterkil238,2007-12-26T23:22Z,"R_Sweres fock you. On evry torrent from Filmofiel you are complaining. Stop being such annoying and stop saying in evry torrent its fake, spam or (in your word) fucked up. So go back to you own *** dvdfirst site. And if you didn't get the message. FUCK YOU! All torrents of Filmofiel are fine so GET LOST. 

THIS IS NO FAKE !"

,agedoff,2008-02-03T16:26Z,"why use AVI??? It`s the worst format to convert, and its not compatible with no dvd-players!! Suggestion: Use TS or ISO"

This movie is great! 
Sound: 10 -10
