,ZarSu,2010-02-19T20:20Z,Have no idea how this was ripped but the video is sub par (hangs and skips) and audio will not work in VLC or any other player. Win 7 x64.  Ended up deleting them all.
,Dr4000,2010-02-19T22:30Z,"I haven't had any issues with the video at all, no hanging or skipping. The quality is very good considering it's DVD rips of a show that was filmed over 40 years ago.

Sound didn't work under VLC, but played fine under WMP, so ZarSu is probably having a codec problem."

,daycab,2010-10-03T15:55Z,Got the Codec problem figured out and it's just great.  My son LOVES this!  Can anyone tell me where to find other seasons?  Demonoid has Season 3...
