Pirates of the Burning Sea - Open Beta

Release by GeNeSiS

You will need a beta key and a Sony Station account to play this game.


We at GeNeSiS got pretty irritated by the slow download via the Launchpad from Sony Station, so here we supply the installer and 5GB worth of pig-files.

Run PotBS-Install.exe, then place the piggs-folder in the Pirates of the Burning Sea-folder the game was installed in. Start the Launchpad and let it download the rest of the files for you. Should only be about 150MB instead of 5.15GB.
