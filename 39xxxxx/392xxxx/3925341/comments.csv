RIDLEY SCOTT'S ALL-NEW ""FINAL CUT"" VERSION OF THE FILM"
,deadman3000,2007-12-10T21:01Z,Will you be sharing the other discs? I am after the extras mainly as I will be grabbing the HD version of the Final cut.
,Brad1974,2007-12-11T09:45Z,"If there are no further discs, this torrent could've been named more appropriately as ""The Final Cut DVD9 1/2"".

UCE is just extras and various versions, plus lots of merchandise you would be missing out on anyways."

,mike18xx,2007-12-19T02:31Z,"Oh, for crying out loud -- would somebody state exactly which of the three released film versions are on this particular DVD in this torrent? (Or are all three, which kinda butchers the quality...?)

Looking for the unblemished original international release version *from this boxed-set*....."
,trdi,2007-12-23T01:17Z,"mike18xx, which part of the ""final cut"" do you not understand? Your version seems to be on disc 3...

Patience, people!"
