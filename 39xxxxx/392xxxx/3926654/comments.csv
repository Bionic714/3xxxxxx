Both have different scenes and I'm trying to compile a composite between the three versions available. "

,nIx76,2010-06-11T21:42Z,"prithwi, Thanks again. Very good quality.

John Woo/Van Damme/Lance Henriksen shined in this one

Yancy Butler looked great in this one. What a rare beauty.

soggyorigam This is the 95 mins version

This is one of JCVD better movies, You have to watch it. great film for 1993 and still very good today."
