,hockpooh,2007-12-05T06:46Z,"Nothing works with Leopard yet. Use your head and downgrade to Tiger. I was one of the first people to get Leopard but not dumb enough to install it yet.

OK, so you have Leopard. Big deal, live with the disappointments. Sorry, but that's all I see anymore it Johnny cum earlies complaining that nothing works with Leopard. We already knew that. Tell it to the makers of third party applications, and after they fix it then you can go download a free copy."
,macminicz,2007-12-05T14:36Z,"Popcorn, Toast and MacTheRipper are OK in leopard. Do not believe hockpooh."
,Jadocs,2007-12-06T01:48Z,"hockpooh, stop being a knucklehead.  I was pointing it out so people who are running Leopard don't waist their time downloading it.  I'm sure it works fine in Tiger.

And FYI, all my programs run fine in Leopard"
,golfpro,2007-12-07T22:34Z,Toast doesn't work well with Leopard. MANY people are having major issues with Toast 8.0.3. It works but very slowly and creates major dock issues. Google it. Lots written about this in Mac forums.
,Jadocs,2007-12-08T08:57Z,Toast 8.0.3 and Popcorn 3.0.2 both work perfectly in Leopard for me.
,tmaxx666,2007-12-09T05:30Z,"Get a clue.  When changing from Tiger to Leopard do a CLEAN install.  Wipe your drive clean and start from scratch. Eliminates 99% of the idiot's problems.  I did on  G4, G5 and Intel iMacs.  Toast  8.0.3 and all the other mentioned programs run great on all 3 machines."
,aarin,2007-12-18T18:01Z,do u have the serial number to activate it????
,sublimemtb,2007-12-25T21:44Z,if you go to the Fast DVD Copy website it says V4 is compatible with leopard
,tulyferrari,2008-01-07T22:37Z,"Can some one tell me where can i find a serial number for dvd copy mac, please."

,patrick80639,2008-01-29T08:33Z,"Leopard users, I've just put up version 4.1, which works well with OS X 10.5. http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4001515/"
