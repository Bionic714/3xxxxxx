I've imported the 5 tracks from the Y34RZ3r0r3mix3ed LP not available on the CD/Download edition. I've imported them at the highest quality I can from the vinyl and the files are 320 Kbps MP3s. Track numbers are as they are on the LP.

09 Vessel [Mix 1] (With Bill Laswell)
10 Capital G [Switch] (With Dave Taylor)
12 The Good Soldier [Friend Or Faux 001] (With Sam Fog)
13 Vessel [Mix 2] (With Bill Laswell)
14 Capital G [Finite Climate Mix] (With Ladytron)

I've tried to match the volume to fit in with the CD tracks as best I can, any feedback would be appreciated.
