,drone1969,2007-12-06T11:26Z,"mous1 - You can use Winamp to play flac files. Just search for it and you`ll find it. If you want to play them in Windows Media player you need to download the codecs and the tag extender. The links for them are:-
Tag support for WMP

http://www.softpointer.com/downloads/WMPTagSupport11.exe

and the codec

http://www.illiminable.com/ogg/

Download them and install them."
