This is a brilliant film the British have many faults but some of them rise above and beyond this and William Wilberforce was one of those, a good man in a far from perfect world. I have heard some criticism of the film but the story makes up for any shortfalls in the movie, at least the Americans didn't make the film so we are spared all the gushing sentimentality and yet it is a story that moved me a black Asian man who grew up in London."
