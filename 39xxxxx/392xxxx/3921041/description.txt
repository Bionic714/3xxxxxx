Bomber Terrorist's (Dennis Hopper) elevator plan backfires, so he rigs a bomb to a LA city bus. The stipulation is: once armed, the bus must stay above 50 mph to keep from exploding. Also if LAPD Officer (Keanu Reeves) tries to unload any passengers off, Payne (Hopper) will detonate it. Joe Morton co-stars as Jack's (Keanu's) superior, and Jeff Daniels supports Jack helping him try to defuse the bomb
