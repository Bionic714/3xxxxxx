ALONG WITH A 36-PIECE ORCHESTRA RE-CREATES JUDY GARLAND'S CELEBRATED 1961 CARNEGIE HALL CONCERT SONG-FOR-SONG

On June 14, 2006, Rufus Wainwright took to the stage to recreate "the Greatest Show of All Time ever staged in honor of the Greatest Show of All Time"--Judy Garland's legendary 1961 concert at Carnegie Hall; song-for-song, in its original venue. Garland fanatics feared a fiasco, but the show was a triumph. His sophisticated act of homage to his hero was both a loving tribute and an arch commentary on the original, featuring classics like "Over The Rainbow," "Come Rain Or Come Shine" and "Zing! Went The Strings Of My Heart."

Backed by a 36-piece orchestra and arranged by the Broadway famed Stephen Oremus (Wicked, Avenue Q), Rufus's vocal talent soars over those classic melodies on this 2-disc set.
