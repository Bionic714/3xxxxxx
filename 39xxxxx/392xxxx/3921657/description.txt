Obsidian brings you the results of some 2 million hours toil by el pumpkino magnifico to bring you the ultimate collection of rolling stones outtakes. Over forty sources were included, with much care and feeding done to assure the highest quality sound, with even those poor lonely tracks that had been sorely neglected or over-pampered in their youth being cared for and fed until they were ready to face the world. 

No BBC sessions, no officially released tracks, no live performances (but for a brief trip to hades) are included. Only available in high quality 320 kps mp3 in honor of Brian Jones. 

Special thanx to all those who know who you are
