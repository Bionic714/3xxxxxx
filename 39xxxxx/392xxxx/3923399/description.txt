Where Is It is a nice application to catalog external HDD, CDRs, DVDRs, etc

I\'ve heard that there are many versions available that give problems, but I tried and used this versions for months and I didn\'t have a problem.

The license file included in v3.90 Beta 1 doesn\'t work for v3.90 Beta 2

When I updated to v3.90 Beta 1 I started a brand new catalog file, just in case the developer marked catalogs made with previous cracked version.

I included the v3.83 just in case you want it, and because it\'s portable.


Let me say it again: the v3.90 Beta 1 *does* work.



In both versions I included a .bat to export settings. To import them just double-click the produced .reg file.

For the portable v3.83 to backup settings double-click "copy settings to this folder" and to apply settings double-click "apply settings" :P
