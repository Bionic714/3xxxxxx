,monkiesatemybaby,2008-02-12T01:13Z,Has anybody had this version longer than 30 days other than the poster? Does it still work or not?
[T],bi20,2008-02-14T01:28Z,you couldn't?
,RAMchipz,2008-02-14T01:55Z,"DO NOT USE! Use older versions that are portable or cracked. Even older versions are known to become 'Unregistered' after Whereisit? 'phones home' to check the serial#, and if found to be blacklisted, it will password protect your records with UN: warezuser, PW: unknown (probably random). Starting with 3.90, in addition to locking your data files, it will give you a fake BSOD when you attempt to read the catalog of a new disc into your records.
You've been warned."
