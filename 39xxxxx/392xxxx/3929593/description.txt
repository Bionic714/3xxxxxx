This is a mostly complete Front Line Assembly discography from the 1986 Nerve War tape rips  up to the 2007 remix album Fallout.

All album artwork is embedded in the mp3s and is high quality. Perfect for iTunes Cover Flow or just for kicks. 

VERY organized because i am OCD about that kinda stuff. I don't think anything missed me and if there is tell me so i can fix it on my computer ;]

About bitrate: it verys from 128kbps:[ to 256kbps:]

can't go wrong if you love industrial because along with Skinny Puppy, Front 242, Ministry, KMFDM, and Throbbing Gristle they started industrial music as we know it. I think all those guys are still together too. Don't argue about who started it though, some insane Australian in the late sixties supposedly started it :P 

I know there are a couple of other discographies out there (including some of my own on Demonoid) but...

A]Expansive collection
B]Organized
C]High quality album art

Love you and seed!!! WHOOOO!
