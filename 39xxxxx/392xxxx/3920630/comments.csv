This movie is really great and took me by surprise, for the longest time the only Ossorio movies I had seen were the Blind Dead series which I love very much, about six months back I picked up the Night of the Sorcerers bci dvd, that movie was fuckin horrible so I didn't have very high expectations for Lorely,  outside of the Blind dead series this is the greatest Ossorio your likely to see, great pacing, interesting story, great characters, gorgeous women, dream like atmosphere and some amazing sets later on, highly recommended!!!!"
