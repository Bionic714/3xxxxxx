,ralphparot,2007-12-24T02:13Z,Seeding should be better now.  Problems with PC.  This was from Demonoid.  Can't remember by who.

From Wikipedia: ""The novel was dramatized as a seven-part television series for the BBC in 1979. It was shown in 1980 in America on PBS as part of their Great Performances series with introductions by Robert MacNeil to help explain the workings of the British Secret Service. Later American showings edited the seven episodes into six, and it is this format that is currently available on DVD in the US."""
,nickytwotime,2009-02-27T17:27Z,"don't download! the quality is garbage, and the opening sequences and credits are missing. for hardcore lecarre/bbc fans, this will be an utter disappointment. there is a much better version currently seeding, an actual dvd rip. 

ralphparrot, thanks for the effort but you should include some of these details so people can make informed decisions."

,Evilution,2012-03-13T11:27Z,"@always2ool; Newsflash, this show is from 1979. No HDTV, no 16:9, no DD/DTS 5.1.
Yeah, the transmission quality of TV 30+ years ago was bad compared to today. Go figure!"
