Based on the S.E. Hinton novel of the same name. The tension between two groups: The Greasers and The Socials "Socs" puts Ponyboy Curtis (Howell) and his best friend Johnny Cade (Macchio) in a bad spot. One night at the movies, Ponyboy and Johnny fall in love with Sherri "Cherry" Valance (Lane) and Marcia (Meyrink) once they get Dally Winston (Dillon), the toughest and meanest of the Greasers to stop attempting to "score" Cherry and Marcia. What Johnny and Ponyboy don't know is that Cherry and Marcia are girls for the snobbish, popular, and rich group, the Socs. Once Johnny kills Bob Sheldon (Garrett), the toughest and meanest member of the Socs, this begins as the Socs demand a rumble against the Greasers.
