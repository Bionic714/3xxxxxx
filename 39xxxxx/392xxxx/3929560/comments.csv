IMDB gives this film a 6.7, but that's kind of underrating it. It's one of the more original teen comedies of the 80's. Probably deserves a rating somewhere in the 7.0-7.5 range.

Besides, the supporting character is about 15 or 16 as I remember, I've not yet watched it again, but you seem like you haven't watched it at all. He was super-smart and was admitted early. Anyways, thanks for the upload, even if you don't know what you're talking about.."
