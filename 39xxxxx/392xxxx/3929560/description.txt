Movie: Comedy Nerds College Science Technology Mystery Soundtrack 80s Val Kilmer

By far the best of the 1980s "nerd" comedies featuring highly intelligent
protagonists, "Real Genius" catapulted Val Kilmer to stardom. Like many
good 80's films, "Real Genius" is backdropped by a memorable soundtrack.

Subtitles *should* automagically list in VLC if in the same folder as the
movie when it is played (and nothing is renamed); otherwise drag them in.
Note: The included English subtitles are quite atrocious and badly mangle many
of the memorable lines (a sacrilege for one of the most quotable movies ever).
