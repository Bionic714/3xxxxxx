This exciting new project was created by producer Rio (Adrien Zerbini) of Bluefish, and Brazilian guitarist Ecio 
Parreira. They conceived the idea of fusing well-known disco tunes with Bossa Nova whilst working on an album with Brazilian singer Diana Miranda. Take the most famous disco hits (The Bee Gees, Abba, Donna Summer, Michael Jackson, etc...) Mix them with bossa-nova. Shake hard and you will get Eldissa, a multi background band (Brazil, West Indies, Switzerland, France, UK). Already released in more than 35 countries, featuring in commercials, topping foreign charts, this incredible Bossa Disco cover project keeps conqueering the world.
