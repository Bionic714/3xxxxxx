Proper stereo only uses very slightly more disk space, but there is no comparison in sound quality and stereo separation.....................

Thanks for the effort though"

,Hot Rodny,2008-08-21T23:23Z,"Joint stereo is kind of a fake stereo that pans the mono in order to achieve the same effect as stereo for the human ear.

I really appreciate people that take time to rip music and present it like this so that we can benefit from it.

But when that is said, i do not understand why people still uses joint stereo when ripping. Not anymore, when the hard disk space is so cheap. I am unable to see any advantages with joint stereo. 
Please give me feedback on that if you see im missing something in this matter."
