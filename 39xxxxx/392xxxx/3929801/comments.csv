,vidiation,2007-12-25T05:49Z,"Excellent quality rip, nicely encoded, plays on DIVX player.  Movie itself is pretty lame - I'm deleting and terminating the seed.  iMDB rating of 4.9/10 is fair enough.  "
,drsims,2007-12-31T05:14Z,"thats for the movie ,they say its dum ,but some time man you got to like stuped ,it takes your mind a-way that y u get the moves  from hear...good"
,tinuviel949,2008-01-05T02:11Z,"how can one expect good reviews when noone speaks english correctly, who's rating this, a bunch of 4th graders? damnit you kiddie fucks suck!"
,reiemix,2008-01-11T21:49Z,"lol tinuviel, your english sucks too . but maby you`re a 5th grader ?

I mistakenly thought it was dumb at first, but then soon realized the complete stupidity was entirely intentional, then it became hilarious and after I saw it was from the same wacky creators of the Tim & Eric Awesome show I realized this was really just great. Free your mind before viewing, thats right. the humor is borderline retarded and juvenile, plus insane but I loved it. I guess it's not for everyone but I genuinely laughed at several scenes. At least the humor was well thought out, over the top, & intention unlike some other movies that are out at the time that were way too forced & contrived with less of a coherent or compelling plot. Brothers Solomon is one to check out if you like weird things straight outta left field like me. "

,Electrish,2010-05-15T05:04Z,"Thanks so much for this! I'm quite keen to check it out, can't buy it locally, and can't afford to import it atm. I'm looking forward to watching, despite the strong caveats that some reviewers (elsewhere) have given about the film."
,Reznerk,2010-07-06T18:22Z,"It's a decent movie, if you like watching nieve old men make asses of themselves, in which I do. Imdb is stupid, their ratings are always retarded. I'd give it a selective 7/10. Great rip, keep em coming."
,CD12,2011-02-19T20:25Z,I had some syncing issues with this. Can anyone help me?
,pricegeoffrey,2012-04-20T23:22Z,"Nice that people have been so cool about seeding this difficult-to-find comedy by Bob Odenkirk (who most people know as Saul, from Breaking Bad, and from Mr Show, with David Cross), and Will Arnett from Arrested Development. This was made just prior to Odenkirk's early involvement with Tim and Eric, and two other similar type movies are Let's Go to Prison (stupid humor like this) and Melvin Goes to Dinner (more witty and very female-friendly for early movie-at-home dates and such.....) Again, thanks for seeding for so long"
