,djcarlito,2007-12-15T01:58Z,"This is a new spanish movie, hollywood already bought the rights and is making an US version of it....it's suppose to be good (that is if you speak spanish and don't mind a movie filmed with almost no budget...like the blairwitch project) Personnally I suppose that the US version of it will be better (like vanilla SKY the US version of abre los ojos another spanish movie) "
