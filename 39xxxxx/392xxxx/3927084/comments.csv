,journe,2010-02-27T02:26Z,"I've had no problems with installation by simply mounting the given ISO, and choosing the ""Full Install"" option. I haven't bothered with a cdcrack, so I can't comment on issues there because, really...You've already got the mounting program since you could install, what's the big deal with having to take a few seconds to mount an ISO before playing a game?

Note: If you plan to install Throne of Bhaal right away, you don't need to bother with the SoA patch, as intalling ToB also installs that. You should still install the ToB patch, however.

By the way, I'm running this on Windows 7 x64, for those wondering if it's compatible."
,Naivor,2010-03-07T18:20Z,"Just do the full install when prompted during installation, then mount the expansion disk when you want to play.

,Medahre,2010-03-13T06:10Z,"Hi everyone.

So managed to install everything with full install and also added the patch and succesfully start the game. But my problem is that it runs painfully slow even with the lowest settings.

I've tried with unchecking 3D-settings = nada
I've tried with closing down backgroundprograms = nada
I've tried with fixes in dxcfg = nada

Sure, my laptop is more than a couple of years old and problably starting to crash but I don't have problems with any other games. Have anyone experienced the same thing and managed to fix it?

I run an old packard bell with XP SP3, 1.33 GHz proc, 192 MB ram, DivX 9.0, and some unknown grahpic card (I don't remember the name, writing from work computer right now).

And before you'll tell me, yeah I know I need a new computer but for that I need to save some cash first =("
,SGT_artillary,2010-06-14T11:00Z,"AWESOME torrent, Downloaded this on june 13th 2010. Just to give a heads-up to people new to torrents. Mount the zip file or rar file do not winzip or unzip this download. Run it straight from daemon tools or whatever virtual cd drive you are using. After installing the baldurs gate 2 original then mount the zip file for the expansion. Keep in mind for BOTH installs choose the FULL install option so that you wont get promted to insert cd's throughout your game. These are old games and back in this day not many people had nice computers if at all having one, so they broke down the installs so that your computer would only install the minium data onto your hard disk drive (HDD) and run the rest off the cd's which made the game playable on most any computer instead of just the top of the line back then. there is another awesome torrent download for BG1 here  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3258554/Baldurs_Gate_1__amp___Tales_of_The_Sword_Coast_(Expansion) I really have to give a huge thanks to you torrent masters.

I recommend however to anyone getting this torrent to immediately go to gibberlings3.net and get their fixpack, as it will resolve a terrible issue with the TOB content, Watchers Keep namely. Run this mod after you install the patch!!!

Here's a direct link http://www.gibberlings3.net/readmes/readme-bg2fixpack.html

from there click on ""Check for the most recent version"" at the top of this page then select a mirror of your choosing. The page previous to this one also has all the patch notes, so be sure to read them carefully as many aspects of this mod are optional. ""Core Fixes"" and ""Text Update"" are the 2 most important.

Apart from fixing fatal bugs that make certain quest incomplete-able this mod also introduces a lot of good content that for the most part was intended by the developers."

Mounted and installed it with Daemon tools, patched, everything worked fine.

When playing though when selecting and examining many of the items I get an error and instant crash.
Something to do with the icons not being found.

I figured it may have something to do with CD1 being corrupt, there is also a file in the torrent labelled ""required"" with a couple of files inside I can't identify and no instructions on what to do with them.

I am currently downloading everything again, in case it was just a fuckup with bittorrent that fucked CD1.

Anyone know anything about this.

Never played this before, looking forward to it after playing icewind dale.

stop saying just mount it, its not a solution and people dont know wtf you mean.

to everyone who doesnt know what mount mean it simply means ""use"" yes its simply double clicking the file and running it with power ISO its that simple yet these assholes are trying to confuse you because they wanna pretend to be smart.

hey assholes go ""mount"" a horses arsehole your pricks.

anyhow i have USED the file extracted all files to a neutral folder and chosen FULL install and i still get prompted to insert disk one at 95% stopping me from fully installing.

,docattack,2011-10-01T04:36Z,"Ok Guys, this is how you do it:

First download Power Iso trial (or look on PB for download)

Link---- http://www.poweriso.com/download.htm

After download install trial.

-------------------------------------------------------

1. Find the Baldurs Gate ISO file (you just downloaded it...)
2. Mount the ISO file called 'bg2' (to mount, right click file>Power ISO>Mount to drive ""whatever""
3. Go the my computer or whatever and you should have a ""cd"" in a drive. Open that cd (or explore by right click>explore.)
4. Find Setup.exe (icon is a computer, sometimes you have to right click>Run as administrator.)
5. Do a full install!!! (saves changes cds when playing game.)
6. If you want to install 'Throne of Bhaal' otherwise skip to-
7. While in the ISO file that is mounted locate Setup.exe in Baldur's Gate 2.Throne of Bhaal file. Run this. Then run Patch BGII-ThroneofBhaal_Patch_26498_ENGLISH"
,docattack,2011-10-01T04:45Z,"****That was meant to be skip to 8****

8. So you installed BG2 right? Good... But when you run it asks for a cd right? Good... Lets stop that.

9. Go here--http://m0002.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_baldurs_gate_2.shtml#Baldur%27s%20Gate%202%20[ANY%20VERSION]%20INFINITYCRACKER%20v1.1


10. Download-- ""Baldur's Gate 2 [ANY VERSION] INFINITYCRACKER v1.1""

11. Extract the files with winzip. Then take ""infinitycraker"" and place it in you BG2 folder. which should be around here- ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Black Isle\BGII - SoA.""

12.Right click>Run as admin 'infinitycracker'

13.Open a beer, roll a smoke, play the game. But remember to click ""baldur.exe"". Otherwise you'll get a problem. make a shortcut or something hell if i know.

Thanks

Docattack"
,docattack,2011-10-01T04:49Z,"***YOU DO NOT NEED TO EXTRACT/UNZIP THE ISO FILES***

just mount and run setup.exe

,takeaimnfire,2011-10-17T05:36Z,"Actually mounting, and running the iso in power iso are 2 completely different things terrorlord13.  Mounting is like running the actually cd on virtual drive.  Whereas opening it in power iso is just allowing you to see what's on the disc.  Sometimes you have to mount to a virtual drive in order for it to install properly.  So no, no one is just trying to be a dick.  They're trying to tell people how to do it properly, and the way that will definitely work."

oh, and-@takeaimnfire- Mounting and ""running"" ,as you put it, ARE in fact the same thing. In power ISO, Daemon Tools, etc. you MUST mount the .iso file for it to be viewable in the file system. Opening it in the file system off-shot is mounting it and looking at it's content. Mounting it and auto-running is the exact same thing, except auto-run save you half-a-second of opening the file system. If you are that ignorant, why boast of your lack of knowledge? You are an arrogant one, you know. Especially for someone who is wrong, and defending folks who are also wrong and quite rude.
@terrorlord13 Even though you are correct, and quite annoyed at those giving half-ass explanations, look at what that can-o-worms opens. Lol."
