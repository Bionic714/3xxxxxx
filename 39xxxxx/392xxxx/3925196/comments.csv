Enjoy!

I am happy to share all my collection with you!

I very much appreciate all the efforts that you are deploying to keep the Fu alive by seeding these torrents, whenever possible and with the means that you have at your disposal, and I sincerely thank you all.

Together, let's keep the Fu alive, REGARDLESS OF THE CARYING BOAT!

If you happen to be an active seeder, please drop your hotmail email address so that other Fu Members could contact you for a possible reseed.

There are three of us stuck at 16.6% on this torrent, anyone kind enough to help out?

I'm a reliable seeder these rarer and marginally surviving torrents ... don't care if it takes a week at 1kb/s, just asking for some kung fu assistance! :)

Ta."

Just loving seeing sammo smoke opium with a zombie.
It's so kitsche - it's classic!

:)"

Thanks for the wonderful effort of uploading the stuff but i am stuck at 38.1% for last two days! If the torrent creator james or other seeder can help, that will be highly appreciated... i have part 1 but i really wish to see part 2 as well."
,scorpio_1112,2009-09-21T13:39Z,"Hi Again

Oh by the way, my download finished next day only, so thanks to the uploader for that, and yes i have been seeding it since this, 4-5 x already. 

One thing though, the quality of this part 2 is somewhat inferior to part 1, maybe it happened because when the encoder tried to hard code the subs (yes they are, in white font for Cantonese and English sub titles), but still its very watch worthy in its size!

Thanks again!"
,princeofpiracy,2011-10-27T22:06Z,I'll help out by seeding this one. Great movie and very rare to find.

Thank you so much for this, I will seed as long as I can."
