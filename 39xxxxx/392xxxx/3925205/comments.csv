Enjoy!

I am happy to share all my collection with you!

I very much appreciate all the efforts that you are deploying to keep the Fu alive by seeding these torrents, whenever possible and with the means that you have at your disposal, and I sincerely thank you all.

Together, let's keep the Fu alive, REGARDLESS OF THE CARYING BOAT!

If you happen to be an active seeder, please drop your hotmail email address so that other Fu Members could contact you for a possible reseed.

If anyone has a good proper copy please upload."

,Seany,2009-03-17T11:56Z,"The TP is not obligated to re-seed at all, he's seeded ALOT of movies and it's upto the leechers to help seed aswell.

Saying that, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS unless you want to listen to dual audio streams/are going to mute it/ or just want to look at the fight scenes or whatever.

It's pretty unwatchable. 

""License to Steal"" suffers the same problem, I don't think there's a way to switch off one of the streams, I've looked it up several times but if some knows.. "
