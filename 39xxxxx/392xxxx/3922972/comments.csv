,LiL_Killa,2008-01-05T07:59Z,Hey is this really all 246 dragon ball z episodes and does these have the Menus  and extras to the dvd's
,skanman14,2008-01-07T03:18Z,"yo, i used to watch this shit as a kid. bomb."
,sektr,2008-01-14T21:56Z,"There are missing jap. episodes between dvd 6 and 7.
Episode 55-67 to be exact. but you can find those episodes in english dubbed instead on dvd.
I think the jap episode 55 is episode 42 of the dubbed version, and you can find that one on dvd 5. I havent checked if there are any other missing episodes, but it doesnt look like it.
Dont download this torrent if it's the japanese version you're interested in, because the subtitles are horrible and some sentences arent even translated.
Besides these arent the real dvd's, they're just ripped episodes that has been compressed into decent quality and then placed onto these dvds.
But thanks for uploading them anyway, it's allways nice to have all the english ones :)"
,sektr,2008-01-14T22:09Z,"to LiL_Killa:
There's is no extra material on the dvds.
The menus are homemade from the looks of it.
There's more then 246 DBZ episodes.
277 english dubbed ones and 291 japanese and all the english ones are here"

thanks =)"
,lot-meltdown,2009-02-05T06:05Z,hey bad news for all the first 6 dvds are in english but after that they are all jap. episodes not good to say all english when they r not
,rbft,2009-05-05T21:02Z,"They are in english, if you have problems playing them in english check your sound settings. I did not make these DVD's, they are from another member that released them back in 2005 but all the torrents lost seeds so I just put them together in one glump. I apologize if they are not up to your standards but they are free and everything is there as I have watched all of them."

,ViccyQ,2011-01-27T10:09Z,"Honestly this is lame.

 I have been downloading this over a week now...I have uploaded 361 Gigs and currently only downloaded only 79%...

Im looking at the peers and there is on average only 5 people seeding and of all those people seeding, they are only seeding 0.5 kb/s or like 2.0kb/s

Why the HELL are people restricting their upload speeds? I have been seeding at full speed the entire time hence teh 361 Gigs. Once this is done I will seed for about another 2 weeks."
,nemewsys,2011-01-29T13:55Z,OMG SOMEONE SEED THIS!!!! SO MUCH FOR THE BULLSHIT ABOUT INTERNET AND FREE CULTURE!!! YOU'RE ALL HYPOCRITES IF YOU DONT SEED!!!
