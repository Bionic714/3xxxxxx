,metalhead75,2007-12-31T10:12Z,"I know alot of people who hack and no, you won't get banned by EA for using hacks. Maybe you'll get banned from a specific server if they catch you a few times, but not your CD key. Although I think hacking is for pussies and anybody who needs to hack to play this game should go back to playing Nintendo."
,metalhead75,2008-04-22T18:05Z,"I'm sure they used to try to catch hackers when this game first came out, but not anymore. I see people on a daily basis with aimbots and wall hacks, and they haven't been banned yet. I don't think it's worth it to risk getting caught and getting your key banned, but it can and is currently being done without getting caught."
,kyle756,2008-04-23T22:00Z,"And how do you expect people to use this?
You didnt even tell them how dude!
All you said for the hack is ""start the hack"". But how do you start it some people must think. I do not got BF2, im just seeing what some of these comments say!"
,chompa420,2009-03-01T04:11Z,wow nubs if the server is running pbbans for example or if someone get a screen shot of you hacking you will get caught and your cd-key will get banned
