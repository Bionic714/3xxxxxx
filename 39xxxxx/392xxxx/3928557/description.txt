"Tinyfolk?s new album Bill is the most epic lo-fi album I?ve ever heard. For the uninitiated Tinyfolk comes from the mind of Russ Woods (and sometimes Meghan Lamb) and is from Indiana. On occasion Russ?s voice reminds me of Daniel Johnston, but his standard instrument of choice is a baritone ukulele. As Tinyfolk he writes quirky, cute songs with a dash of longing behind all of them. I?ve had the pleasure of playing a show with him a few months back and he was so nice and just as adorable in person."
