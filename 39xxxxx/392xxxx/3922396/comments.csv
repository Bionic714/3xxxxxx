,Bulteni,2008-01-25T22:54Z,Thank you!
,bluefire132,2008-02-22T00:38Z,"the first three episodes are great, but then

the fourth and fifth dont have the sound done right.  there is a hardcore echo effect which makes it unwatchable.

i only tested up to thus far, the fifth one.  and also, I only watched with WMP, maybe something else will make it work?"
,PocketPoop,2008-02-25T18:17Z,sound is fucked up on pretty much all the episodes except like 3
,sverkere,2008-03-02T12:48Z,Sounds good to me.

,DrunkPollock,2008-08-30T05:35Z,Audio has been fine for me. Playing in 5.1 on my Xbox 360. 
,themixingbowl,2008-09-09T16:04Z,"GREAT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!!! I just got done watching all the episodes and I have to say, it made me emotional through out. I can't say that for many shows. I hated a character they made me like, liked characters I hated, was happy, sad, angry, laughed a lot and felt depressed at times. What a great fucking series! I watched this after I saw all the Undeclared episodes, I would suggest watching those if you like this one. GREAT SHOWS. TOP UPLOAD Pruttmongot"
,themixingbowl,2008-09-09T16:06Z,"On a side note. Mentioned above about lack of quality in sound. I had no problems using VLC, picture perfect and sound was great!"
,electro cute,2008-09-26T19:01Z,"first of all - great upload. i used vlc and sound and picture was perfect.

,ToadKills,2009-01-06T06:51Z,"Is that true about the episodes being labeled wrong? Do they have an opening title or anything distinguishing for this to be easily corrected if true? Thanks for the up. Wanted to see this for awhile. I would also suggest ""Undeclared"" for all you out there. It's pretty funny stuff."
,ceilingtracer,2009-01-20T13:19Z,this torrent is fine.  sound and video quality is great.  episode labels are correct.  THANKS!

,Lunar52,2010-05-27T08:22Z,"thanks man, appreciate it. will seed"
,stuck4ever,2010-06-11T03:45Z,"Thanks for the up, video quality is superb but the sound is fucked up when you play it in WMP, I checked with media info...it seems that there are two similar audio tracks in some of the video files which is causing the echo...this is not the caae with other media players because they have an audio switcher in-built."
,stuck4ever,2010-06-11T03:51Z,"upload is perfect and downloading is very fast..thanks to pruttmongot...video is perfect but audio as mentioned is fucked up in many episodes as there is an echo while playing with WMP, I checked with mediainfo, it seems that there is an extra stream of audio in many of the files which is causing the echo.
I just removed the extra audio."

,BramLovesYou,2011-01-02T19:35Z,"HERES HOW TO CORRECT ORDER:
*The only episode that is out of order/mislabeled is EPISODE 4. It's the episode where a girl writes on Sam's locker. It's not episode 4, it's actually episode 16.

Everything else is in the correct order (so episode 4-16 are off by one number, but still in the right order). 

Just rename episode 4 as episode 16, and then relabel the rest.

ie:
5 is 4
6 is 5
7 is 6
8 is 7
9 is 8
10 is 9
11 is 10
12 is 11
13 is 12
14 is 13
15 is 14
16 is 15
17 is 17
18 is 18

See how it skips one? There's only one episode that's out of order. "
,pirateburger,2011-01-06T21:06Z,"@BramLovesYou

Dunno what you're on about, but Wikipedia tells me that the episode with Rashida Jones writing on Sam's locker is indeed episode 4 and not 16.

They appear to all be in the right order. Up to episode 5 at least cuz that's what I've watched up to so far.

As for sound, they're all just fine. I use VLC player."
,arthoheen,2011-04-11T19:54Z,The Episode Order is in right Order. And the Quality is really good.
,gbthecat,2011-05-18T11:57Z,Awesome
