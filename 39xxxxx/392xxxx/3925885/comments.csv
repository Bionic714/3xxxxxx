I really expected people to be help seed by now.  
That's gratitude for you, as usual.

The main 3 files are the exact same size but won't hash. The txt won't hash either. Something has been added to this copy because mine's 3.37gb. Menus are different. I may be downloading as well.

We'll have to move on to Vol 2 soon. It checked perfectly."
,babe9,2007-12-20T00:07Z,"Ah ok, I think I recall the problem here. I won't be seeding this torrent."
,nympholept,2007-12-20T03:41Z,"This is a straight copy of a DVD directly from EYB.

What's the problem?"
,babe9,2007-12-20T18:22Z,You have a different version. Mine's from demonoid.
,nympholept,2008-01-11T05:50Z,"K'sandra from ETS took my offer of a snail-mail copy of the DVD in the mail, and is now seeding this torrent, many thanks."
,babe9,2008-01-12T18:59Z,Thanks! I didn't think this was going to get seeded.
,noisecollector,2008-11-30T05:38Z,"please seed a little bit more these nice rarities (specially the interview essentials)

thanks, nympholept for such a great effort on sharing this kind of stuff

from a dead man, greetings"
,the_brotherhood,2009-06-25T23:32Z,"Can anyone please seed this for at least a few hours? I started downloading it on 05.05.2009, it's been almost 2 months, and I am only as far as 78.8%. Not only me, there seem to be 6 or 8 other leechers with the same problem. It gets on for just a few minutes a day, and we can add 0.1 up to 1%. This torrent really needs a few hours of seeding. http://thepiratebay.org/user/nympholept/ , thanks for sharing this rarity. Please seed!"
,nympholept,2009-06-29T19:21Z,"Dude, read the torrent description!
