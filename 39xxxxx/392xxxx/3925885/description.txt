EYB says: "
	A rough and ready not for profit collection of all the broadcast interviews I could get my hands on, 
	Not in any particular order, including a few requests people asked me for. 
	Quality varies, but I went with the highest I could find.
	Also includes a small bonus, the Burn film clip from the NBK laserdisc. 

	2 hours all up.

	Many thanks to kleptonin, Frankie, Leviathant, Itsjustdave, Greg, Orestes, Athenia Animus, Maggiebear and Rustybones for all helping me out with these in one way or another.
