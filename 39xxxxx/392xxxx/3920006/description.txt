This is Heatmiser's first full release (1993), Dead Air. It was just recently re-released by Frontier Records - and if you can afford to buy it, I would highly recommend doing so - especially the fun vinyl colors, but if you are either broke or live where it is not available, enjoy this option in the interest of good music.
