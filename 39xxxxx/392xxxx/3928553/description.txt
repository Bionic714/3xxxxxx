Recorded in a ghost town in the past during a dance with Lucy, the dear old dame. But, soon enough, the future caught up, and I left my one-chorded guitar in an old forgotten place.

Sir Guitar, christened 'Blackbird Under My Feet', climbed a mountain of rattlesnake crackles to sit for years at the top, while the clouds blipped and bellowed at him. Long they became complacent, and he caught a ride on one of the fluffy monstrosities, forever to travel the world naked and alone.

And then I woke up, and discovered that I had recorded my dreams.
