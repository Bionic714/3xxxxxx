,BuddhaSearch,2008-07-08T00:49Z,"For the people having problems with this:

There is a problem with this torrent if you are using uTorrent as a client (don't know about other clients).  The problem is that the torrent file lists only one tracker as follows:

udp://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce

uTorrent cannot use 'udp' trackers.  Therefore, to help the situation do the following:

1. Add the torrent to the uTorrent as normal.

2. Right-click on the torrent listing in uTorrent and select 'Properties'.

3.  Copy and paste the following two lines into the 'trackers' box:

http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce

http://open.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce

4.  As it is of no use to uTorrent you might as well delete the line:

udp://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce


5.  If you don't mind using DHT then make sure the 'DHT' check-box has a 'tick' in it.  If you do mind using it then don't 'tick' the box.

If enough people using uTorrent do the above then the  torrent should speed up a bit for them.

That said it would help if folks using other clients would add the above two tpb open 'HTTP' trackers to their tracker list - in that way the torrent would speed up for all across all clients.  Unfortunately I don't know how to do that in other clients.

P.S.  Very many thanks for this dohduhdah.  But  on behalf of uTorrent users could I please request the use of some open non-udp trackers in your torrents.  Unless, of course, you really have something against uTorrent - in which case, we'll find a way.  ;-)
Many thanks."

,Sura_Espen,2009-03-18T13:16Z,seed is good
,kentsrose,2009-03-26T22:05Z,"Thanks, Buddhasearch.

I did what you suggested, and watched my download and upload speeds go from 1.2 K/b to almost 50 K/b s, so I should get this in about 3 days."
,kentsrose,2009-03-26T22:08Z,"Thanks, dohduhdah, for making our lives more meaningful with this library of knowledge!"
,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:19Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.

,john6425,2010-09-21T15:40Z,"I'm so glad to have found amazing torrents like this, I wish more people would download things like this.

TPB has a section for porn, why not a dedicated section for Education????!!?!?!?

Contact TPB admins and ask them to add another section"
,john6425,2010-12-15T13:37Z,For those of you with slow download speed you need to turn up your UPLOAD speed to download faster. Google for how to do this.
,john6425,2010-12-15T13:41Z,"This is one of the best courses by TTC. 

But be warned. If you don't have a good understanding of physics you won't get most of what he's saying. It's somewhat intensive, going all the way from photo electric effect and other quantum mechanics stuff. 

If you are a HS student who has not completed physics and chemistry this is NOT for you. Also a general knowledge of astronomy is helpful because the courses go fast through material assuming you are already somewhat familiar with the ideas. 

My recommendation for this course would be for college level and above, and for those who already have a general knowledge of astronomy. "
