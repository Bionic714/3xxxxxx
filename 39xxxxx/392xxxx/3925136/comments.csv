,[makall],2008-05-14T07:27Z,Is the SB3 Plus inside this torrent?
,[makall],2008-05-15T21:01Z,"To fix the save problem,
just create a folder ""save"" inside the Data folder.

something like this: \ILLUSION\Sexy Beach 3\Data\Save\

:)

PS: Anyone can tell me if the SB3 Plus is in this torrent?! I heard that we can play with that lady on the lobby in SB3 Plus."
,meccoy,2008-05-16T10:41Z,"yes if you are haveing trouble installing or playing the game its your computer,
no you dont need to put the Game folder in the program files folder you can put it in what ever folder you want it to be in, 
and yes it includes the + edition

dont know about the save problem but if creating a save folder dosent work try removeing write protection on subfolders

and for trouble starting the game try changeing the OS it bots from its not a common problem but i know it exist have encounterd it a few times with some games (quick screen crash)
""try updateing graphics drivers and if you allready have then it might be a problem with the new drivers""
your graphics card might not be supported 
just a notice, recomended GeForce/Radeon//Intel
also it could be that your computer has a problem starting japanes Aplications,
dont know its a wild guess

,newslimepirate,2010-11-10T05:28Z,"Played on Windows 7 Ultimate x64. Works perfectly as long as you do not change the file path after you've installed it.

If you are getting any directx errors, download and install this:
http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/DirectX-9.0c-Redistributable.shtml
regardless of what version of directx you have. It solved alot of directx problems, especially those for games designed for dx9, on my windows 7 with directx11


word of the wise: if you place anything inside the install folder for this game, remove it from there as an uninstall will completely delete everything inside the folder (I lost a few files I had in the same folder) However if you are downloading this, then you obviously don't want to uninstall any time soon ;)"
