This is the complete Hobbit ready by Rob Inglis. The man does a phenomenal job, giving each character a different voice and singing  ::SINGING:: every song. Definitely the best reading of The Hobbit I've heard, and I think the only one on TPB right now. Nothing beats an old British guy reading literature.

The 219 .mp3 tracks are split up between ten folders (for the ten cds they're ripped from), and each track is labeled according to its chapter.

Total listening time is just over eleven hours. Hope you enjoy as much as I do.
