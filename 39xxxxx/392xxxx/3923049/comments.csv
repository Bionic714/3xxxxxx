,Porkster,2008-01-14T18:43Z,"This movie is way too multicultural, crude, and talks about male's privates. It's seriously gay and when you look into who made it you know why it's so.

Another zionist flick to attack western nations."

,Lucky13s,2008-12-12T11:13Z,"Hey Guys, Its been awhile since I last logged on. I figured I should give everyone an explanation. It seems the bigger up loaders have beaten me and I'm not currently uploading anymore, Its because I started uploading new releases and the other uploaders didnt like it and they wanted me to stop. If you guys havent noticed I started off uploading those old favorites (godfather, goodfellas, heat, warriors, vanishing point, etc.). Once I get my movie collection back on my new computer I will gladly re-upload all my releases probably through mininova, its more organised and just easier. I may just stick to uploading the older favorites like I was doing before, its too hard to compete with people like aXXo on the new releases, and its really hard for me to get new releases out so early without ripping them off from people like aXXo, and I dont want to steal their efforts."
