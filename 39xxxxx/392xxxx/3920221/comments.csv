,ScottyMcNoob,2009-09-15T16:31Z,"FIRST OF ALL, i JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS MY FAVOURITE BAND, AN AWESOME TORRENT, ANDi'M SEEDING WHENEVER i'M ONLINE.

However, I've installed the codec to make ogg, FLAC, speex, and theora play, but these flac files still won't play in Sony's Media Go, which is frustrating, as It's more convenient to use that for transferring files to my PSP. Anyone got any ideas on how to make it work?"
[V],oneanight,2009-09-20T21:50Z,"@ ScottyMcNoob 

sorry for the late response.

If you install  http://www.foobar2000.org/download  you will not need to install any other codes.

As for the PSP try Easy CD-DA Extractor and convert flac to Apple Lossless Format = M4A Format

I'm sure that will work for you..;)

and to everybody else thank you for your comments appreciated.."
,scottsasse,2011-04-25T02:19Z,"Damn dude, look at your ratings???? .................somebody doesn't like you too much. Oh well, they can suck my FLACking FLAC!! Anyhoo, THANKS for the upload and THANKS seeders!"
