,johnnash,2008-01-21T00:31Z,"Is it any better than CentOS because it seems CentOS is just the free version of RHEL without customer support ? 
I still needed these fixes here http://paulsdigitalworld.blogspot.com/2008/01/centos-5-fixing-most-annyoing-problems.html 
to get rid of the keyring, make wireless work etc. Are they fixed in this version and why is it a little smaller than the CentOS disc."

,unosito,2008-11-18T00:57Z,"Redhat Enterprise Linux 5.1 is a obviously not free. However, there are several distributions you can use for personal use, server, or even for public usage. Like Scientific Linux, centOS, and Fedora. The above mentioned use the RPM, and YUM package managers, for those who are not familiar with Linux, I suggest you go to these pages, and read the documentations first.

https://www.scientificlinux.org/
http://www.centos.org/
http://fedoraproject.org/
http://www.ubuntu.com/

NOTE: Ubuntu is based on debian, which is probably the easiest distribution out there. It's perfect for beginners, to get familiar and the sense of how Linux works, than you can move to a more technical release if you like it. Since in Linux things are not going to be done for you, unlike with Windows, or Mac. Ubuntu is very popular for that, and it has good documentation."

,mister_playboy,2009-04-12T18:22Z,"Sure you could get CentOS, but where's the fun in that?

It's l33t to have the version you're not SUPPOSED  to have!  RHEL has a cooler logo than CentOS, as well.

This IS The Pirate Bay, after all... :)"
