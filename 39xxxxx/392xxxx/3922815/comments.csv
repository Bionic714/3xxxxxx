,Cappe!,2008-06-18T12:49Z,Where do I download the 2008 version? Link please? :)
,Pirumyan,2008-10-22T11:08Z,why don't you just upload the files?
,RhymesMatter,2009-03-09T23:29Z,man i really DONT understand how u made it work!!!I dled the crack from Game Copy world and got millions of msgs telling me that the exe was incompatible and i should immediately shut down my pc!If i used the wrong crack then why dont u just POST the link for us to see WHICH crack u used exactly!!!
,RhymesMatter,2009-03-09T23:53Z,"Ok that was lame...It really works i dont know how but it really works BUT i will be the helpful one Explain THE whole Situation so that noone has same problems again!So FIRST (after ofc u downloaded this torrent) U Download this 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3936499/Monopoly_2008_%5BEnglish%5D%5BPC%5D

(If for some reason the link doesnt direct u just Press on Pirate bay search Machine Monopoly 2008) 
SECOND After u dled Monopoly 2008 Use Magic ISO or whatever Mount machine u use(Magic iso is the best for the record) Find the folder NO CD (There's only one lol) and from there u will find a rar containing the SO desired crack exe 
THIRD unrar the rar and u get ""MonopolyPB.exe"" or something like that
FOURTH Copy that exe to the Monopoly Here and Now directory 
FIFTH Delete the ORIGINAL ""Monopoly"" exe
SIXTH Rename the ""MonopolyPB"" exe u just copied to ""Monopoly""
FINALLY Play the game...Notice that the new exe will be Green instead of Blue which is in the Here and now version but doesnt matter it works!
Now i hope everyone has A CLEAR view of what to do instead of Roaming Downloading random Cracks."
