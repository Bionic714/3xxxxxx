It Takes A Thief (1968) 102 Takes One To Know One

Noah sends Al, undercover as Roger Hampton III, an American millionaire gambler, to the Principality of Montefiore, a buffer state, which is friendly to the U.S. Montefiore has the richest and classiest casino in all of southern Europe, and with a tourist economy like Monaco's, if the casino collapses, the country collapses. The Montefiore currency, though solid, is vulnerable. It is called the Diamond-Franc, because it's based on Europe's last and biggest batch of family jewels, which are on display in the casino. The S.I.A. has uncovered an organized plan by enemy agents to steal the Montefiore Crown Jewels, and if they succeed, Montefiore will rapidly sink behind the Iron Curtain. Noah does not want this to happen. Al asks Noah in disbelief, "You want me to prevent stealing?" Noah replies "It takes a thief, to spot a heist!"
