The videos are encoded in H264/AVC at 640Ã—360.

They?re iPod compatible, but also high quality enough to watch full screen on your computer or television.

For the best video playback I highly recommend the Combined Community Codec Pack @ http://cccp-project.net


If you enjoy The Chaser's War on Everything support them by purchasing their DVDs!
