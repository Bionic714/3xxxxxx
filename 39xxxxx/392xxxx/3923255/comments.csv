,m2644,2007-12-11T15:48Z,See: http://www.scdb.info/en/ where you can get speed camera updates for Garmin and several other makes.  The cost is approx ÂŁ7 for one years subscription. 
,scrapetorrent,2007-12-20T20:49Z,"Question, I enabled the sound notification as per the instructions but now when approaching a speed camera it says ""Mobile"" in some weird voice.

What is that about? Anyone to change it to the bell like sound heard on a typical tomtom?"

,TheHotShot,2008-01-12T13:16Z,"Thanks  - very useful.

This is *NOT* the Nov 2007 version (I already have that one) - the file sizes are all different to this release.

Missing some of the files - SPECs is amalgamated into one file - so I can't use it, without mucking up my verbal speed alerts.

Thanks anyway"
