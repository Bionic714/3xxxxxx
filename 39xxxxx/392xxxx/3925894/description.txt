If there ever was a movie that a new bride should avoid, it\\\'s Claire Denis\\\'
Trouble Every Day, a shockingly brutal film that caused a commotion at
Cannes after two people fainted during a screening. Hell, there would have
been a ruckus anyway. The film, which was even deserted by the French
press, contains graphic shots of gory cannibalism and masturbation so
disturbing, words can\\\'t do it justice.

You might think honeymooning in Paris is one of the more romantic things a
couple could do, so why does Shane Brown (Buffalo \\\'66\\\'s Vincent Gallo,
kicking it all the way back to 1974) look so agitated during the flight to
France with his new bride, June (Tricia Vessey, Town and Country)? Because
he\\\'s got a pretty dark secret. Those bloody dreams he\\\'s having are a vision
of what\\\'s to come, and there\\\'s nothing he can do about it.

See, Shane has this problem that makes him want to devour his partner during
sex. And I\\\'m not talking about nibbling on the ear, or even cunnilingus. I
mean devour. Eat alive. Tear off chunks of flesh with his teeth. When
Shane and June get to their gorgeous Parisian hotel, he ignores his wife and
beats off in the bathroom because he\\\'s afraid of killing her. Which makes
it all the stranger when June lovingly declares, \\\"I love you so much I could
eat you.\\\"

It turns out that the romantic setting was not Shane\\\'s only reason for
choosing Paris as his honeymoon destination. He\\\'s also looking for Dr. LÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â©o
Semeneau (Alex Descas), who apparently tested some newfangled drug on Shane
years ago. Semeneau, now a discredited disgrace because of his experiments,
is no longer working, but trying to control his own wife, CorÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â© (BÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â©atrice
Dalle), who was also on the receiving end of the drug (let\\\'s just call it
Vampire Viagra). CorÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â© stays locked up in a house with the windows barred
and the doors boarded, but, thanks to some opportunistic burglars, is able
to have a Hannibal special sans fava beans, Chianti or even an open flame.

Denis (Beau Travail), who co-wrote the script with Jean-Paul Fargeau, says
she based Trouble on a dream she used to have as a child, which is only
slightly less disquieting than hearing her say the film isn\\\'t violent,
explicit or about cannibalism. She might be off her nut, but she can sure
make an interesting film, a la Davids Lynch and Cronenberg (whose fans would
probably dig Trouble). One thing is for certain -- Denis loves filming the
naked human body. So if you\\\'re bored with the typical horror crap Hollywood
is spewing out, then this might be right up your alley. As an added bonus,
Tindersticks provides a moody, atmospheric score (they also worked on Denis\\\'
Nenette et Boni).
