,Sickological,2008-12-07T01:44Z,"Great Movie, good quality.

TO ALL PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A GOOD HORROR MURDER THRILLER THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU.

Some people may say it's not realistic, but for you I say this (SPOILER WARNING):





He may have been shot many times, but they were in non vital points of his body, the only thing that SHOULD have killed him was the knife to the throat by the girl, Laurie. But you also have to remember he was considered PURE EVIL, and nobody really knows how strong or capable PURE EVIL really is."
,Sickological,2008-12-14T06:32Z,"EXCELLENT EXCELLENT movie, excellent quality."
,itzrizzo,2009-01-12T21:45Z,"FXG Team - Their work on TPB speaks for itself. If you're looking for excellent quality as well as video...you've come to the right place!

A - 10
V - 10

Overall - 10"
