,AnemicRebirth,2007-12-09T04:38Z,Hmm...no version number and it's half the size of the typical program. What...did you do to it?
[T],Dark_Swordsman,2007-12-09T16:27Z,"all i know is i had this one for quite a while and i use it even now. I been looking for a newer Alcohol, but they all have something wrong...like a trajan...or stupid and complicated patched that are a pain in the ass...mine has a serial number...just reboot, add the serial number and thats it."
,cudaman73,2007-12-09T19:09Z,"AnemicRebirth, I've installed it, It's version 1.9.2, build 1705. Serial works. Doesn't seem to be any virii inside (i've scanned it with multiple scanners)."
[T],Dark_Swordsman,2007-12-10T20:37Z,"well i been using it for quite sometime, and i still am now and no viruses...i know you can be using stuff for a long time and if you keep reformatting your computer like i do, you wouldnt nescessarily know it. but i got attached to it, i rely on it anfd i dont trust a copy from anywhere else because ..i keep trying and other people out there seem to have trojans in theirs and or stupid patches that freeze your computer up. There was Alcohon in other downloads but someone commented and said there was a trojan and not to download. So i hang on the this one still."
[T],Dark_Swordsman,2007-12-10T20:37Z,"its thre only one i trust, so its there for Yunz Guyz to download."
,japanasian,2007-12-11T00:04Z,thanks man shit for some reason my last copy didn't work so this will have to do...
,iceybrezz23s,2007-12-11T00:09Z,HEY THANKS U MOTHER FUCKER I JUST GOT A GODDAMN TROJAN FROM UR FUCKING TORRENT
,northstar.42,2007-12-15T16:16Z,"Yeah, that was a nice try, Peckerhead.  Took 5 whole minutes of my valuable time to boot from another partition and fix the bug you planted.

Good one, douchenozzle.

Anybody getting software from Dark_Swordsman beware."
,northstar.42,2007-12-15T16:30Z,"On a more constructive note, don't forget the F8 key on boot-up, guys.  If anyone gets caught without another bootable partition, you can always boot to the last known good configuration.

Good Luck."
,USA_guy,2008-02-16T08:24Z,Well Dark_Swordsman I'm glad I read the comments before I download anything.  You sure spilled a good heap of shit there and had everybody going.  You're a sick MFer to get off on screwing up people's computers!
,livingstone1021,2008-05-12T00:47Z,"Bitch, I'm glad I read the comments. You probably have multiple accounts and sign on with each of them to leave good comments. You are a crazy child Molesting fag."
,Quiznos1337,2010-02-21T18:57Z,SEED!
