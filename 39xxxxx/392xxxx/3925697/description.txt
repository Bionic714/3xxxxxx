The band/two-man project about:blank came to be a few years ago in its current shape. We are blissfully free of any attempts of trying to make genre music, and simply creates music that we personally enjoy with no particular regard of how it should sound.

This created a pool of songs that were so insanely different from one another that it seemed an impossibility to form a coherent artistic style. Eventually we sorted out the type of songs we enjoyed the most and that were somewhat similar in soundscape and used those as the about:blank soundprofile.

Since we come from two different schools of music, Niklas from vangelisesque instrumental soundtracks and NiN-style alternative rock, Martin from heavy EBM and industrial mayhem, the combination of our efforts became quite interesting.

After several years of polishing, studiomaking and remixing we finally concluded we will never be satisfied with anything. So we stated "screw it" and put a few things of what we had on the new "Destruction Means Progress" album.
