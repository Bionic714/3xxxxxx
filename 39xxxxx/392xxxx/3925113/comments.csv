thanks so much for making these childhood favorites available in an audiobook format. Heinlein introduced me to a whole new way of thinking when I was in 6th grade. Now, my visoion is bad, due to disease, but I can relive the memories with your contribution.

best wishes for 2009 & beyond,

It will take a good deal of time to listen to them all."
