,coolhacker,2007-12-12T21:24Z,unpack .rar and unpack .iso =)
,kasmo,2007-12-12T21:30Z,WTF. I didn't understand.. Im not good at english :D.. But have u unpacked those .rar files.. Example if you have WINrar just click Image.rar    and extract to where ever u want that.. After that is done. You should got image.iso file there.. And u can open that with Daemon tools.. When u click to that and mount that image.iso........... and then open it in your player.
