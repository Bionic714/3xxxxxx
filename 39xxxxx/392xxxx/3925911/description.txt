This is just a collection of what I thought would be the best Nine Inch Nails mixes off of NINRemixes.com and remix.nin.com.  The list is purely subjective and if you have any opinions or comments, I am listening.  I also plan on uploading a two-disc set and the total list of songs I was picking from (52).

This is in no way a disrespect to other lists out there (by the way Limitless Potential is a great collection as well and it heavily influenced me going through all the remixes).  I think it is awesome if people posted more collections of playlists (which is pretty much what this is).

This is the list of songs on this disc:

1. Closer to God-Given (by Reaps)
2. Ruiner (Reconstructed) (by Xerotheory)
3. A Warm Place (Rejected Prom Mix) (by Vorbis)
4. The Way Out is Through (The Trappings Mix) (by Teapot)
5. The Big Comedown (The Bottom) (Leviathant)
6. Gone, Still (Electronic Version) (by Reaps)
7. Leaving Hope (Steveolectric Mix) (by Steveolectric)
8. Everyday is Exactly the Same (Silent Narcotic Mix) (by Silent Narcotic)
9. Only (There is Only DJ Lee FM Radio Mix) (by DJ Lee)
10. The Line Begins to Blur (CstatiC) (by XAI Project)
11. Survivalism (Swamp Mix) (by M J McLean)
12. The Good Soldier (All Good Soldiers) (by Halo33)
13. Capital G (Streetlab Mix) (by Streetlab)
