First of all, thnx for this download!!

Having trouble here to burn this onto a DVD. CloneDVD2 and Cyberlink Power2Go both say they can not do anything with the folder? :S

Weird thing is however that Power2Go says it cannot write 6,9GB onto a 4,7 GB disc (but this download is only 4,35 GB)???

Maybe someone can help by explaining how to burn this correctly.

Thanks in advance!

Dennis"
