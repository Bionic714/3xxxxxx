This is the latest Office product from Microsoft; Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise.

It is a single ISO file that you will burn to a CD using your favorite application (I recommend PowerISO, MagicISO, or ISO Burner...Nero, etc or anything that can burn ISO s will work.

Then, Eject and Reinsert the Office 2007 disk you just burned. The installer will automatically start (if you have AUtoRun enabled.)

Then, click next all the way until it asks you for your CD-Key; go into My Computer and right click on the CD. Click the EXPLORE option.

Then, in the new window double click the Keygen.exe icon. Click SEARCH on the application that opens to get your Serial.
