Run Setup again from the original source disc or download location"" I dont understand this and i was wondering if anyone could tell me what i should do...cheers! "

,WeeWoh,2008-03-03T21:20Z,Hmmm Just put it in a laptop with AVG on it and its picked it up as a trojan. Doesnt matter ive put it on loads of other computers and its been fine. Installing now.
,SkynetP2P,2008-03-07T22:49Z,"Ya WeeWoh I have done the same with no troubles as well.  Just latley anti-viruses have been picking them up as trojans.  & still no trouble except for the fact that one vista lop top out of 4 that i put it on, would not even allow the keygen to be copied into the computer.  I just don't get it, it was logged in as admin, I even turned off the anti-virus so it didn't come on during bootup.  Vista still would not let me copy the keygen.  Is there some special setting in vista that can be turned off? like I say I installed it on 3 other vista comps just fine.  HELP!!!"

,yahway,2008-08-04T16:27Z,"Works fine for me until the installation is about 80% through... then I get a little window pop up that tells me Windows Installer has stopped working and it will have to close. I click Close Program, but the installer window stays up, and the progress bar stays at about 80% and it still says it's installing, it just seems to be frozen on the same point. Any idea what's wrong/how I can fix this?"

Worked like a charm.  thanks mm3 -- great torrent."
,sierramob,2009-07-06T18:18Z,"perfect download - worked great with daemon tools. Used umbepo's keygen code on page 2 of the comments. 

For those of you having difficulty with the download:

Step 1: Download Daemon Tools Lite at http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/home

Step 2: Download the Torrent

Step 3: ""Mount"" the ISO file by using the Daemon Tools bar at the bottom of the screen. (you can just select the file from your downloads folder and then double click in the Daemon Tools Files page)

Step 4: Enter the keygen in the install window when prompted

Step 5: Enjoy."
,NiteMuse,2009-11-21T01:18Z,"Can anyone help me? The file wants to open up in my Roxio program. Something to do with the .iso format.

How can I get this to install if it's opening in my Roxio Creator?"
,NiteMuse,2009-11-21T20:40Z,"Got the Roxio problem figured out.

Another question though... trying to put this on a comp with XP. Get partway through and it asks you to find a folder location to install in, but any folder that I choose comes up as an 'invalid location'

Any suggestions? Or is this just not compatible with WinXP?"
,NationDL,2011-10-20T01:15Z,"Work, not a virus.
Thanks you very much mm3 :)"
