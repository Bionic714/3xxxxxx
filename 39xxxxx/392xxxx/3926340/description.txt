Three-part series which looks at Britain's part in the slave trade.

Part 2
Sugar Dynasty. 

The second programme in this series begins with a powerful drama-documentary telling the story of the Beckford dynasty, one the wealthiest of the families who ran Britain's first global business - slavery.

Using a unique set of family records, it shows how the Beckfords ruthlessly ran their sugar plantations in Jamaica to wring vast profits out of their thousands of slaves. It also tells the story of how lavishly they spent their money back in Britain in an attempt to join the aristocracy and how they eventually became embroiled in the sexual and financial scandals that would destroy them.
