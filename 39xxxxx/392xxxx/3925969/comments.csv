,las_w,2008-01-21T07:21Z,"""The system is not suitable for running MS-DOS  Microsoft Aplications"" is the error I get.  Help?"
,las_w,2008-01-21T07:53Z,"Nevermind!  If the Keygen doesn't work, that okay.  Simply open up the USA and CANDA folder, click on the Keygen there, and Voila,  enter your ID, get the code :)"
,atel97,2008-01-26T19:27Z,"How do you load the US and Canada map in Palm Treo?

I followed the instruction and got the Very Important Guam map though :)"
,brownrt,2008-01-28T01:19Z,After you copy them onto the card and have run TomTom you only need to switch maps from the preferences menu
,piratebay4612,2008-02-14T08:12Z,"I have the navigator running with the guam map, but i am having trouble changing the maps. Could you go into more detail on how to use the large us/canda map? thanks"

,garyblak,2008-04-20T16:05Z,"First of all THX! 2nd, I installed it and when I run navigator on my treo 650 it is showing really small. Only on half the screen. I cannot read it.
Can anyone help me out?"
,garyblak,2008-04-20T16:44Z,"OK, got the problem fixed with the screen res. but the voices aren't working. "
,brownrt,2008-05-07T03:27Z,"Im glad to see my very first torrent is still alive. Im not really sure about the voices problem you are having but there are  a bunch of tomtom voice files avaliable online. try google-ing tomtom voice.

additional clarification. I am pretty sure you have to install the guam map first in order to activate the tomtom software, afterwards you can copy/paste the other maps on to the SD"
,apix,2008-05-15T18:15Z,"There's an easy solution for the voices problem.
I had it on my Qtek 2020.

copy the voices files (3: chk , vif and bmp) to your PPC directory:
Program Files\Navigator\voices\

Now start TOMTOM Navigator and go to settings
They should appear now in the list.

You can do this with the default voices or even the extra funny voices.

Works fine with me.

cheerz"
