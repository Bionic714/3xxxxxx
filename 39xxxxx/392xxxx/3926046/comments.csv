,pinobigbird,2007-12-08T11:02Z,Super release! I was looking for this. Are you planning to release season 1 also? Still looking for Dutch retail DVD of the first season.
,deebeenl,2007-12-08T12:14Z,"No probs. I have the retail original box here, will do so after. I have limited hard disk space, so I can't host both at the same time (and still download stuff myself).

To bad the double layers DVDs are still that pricy..."
,syc0killertje,2007-12-08T15:33Z,"Echt super cool!!
Jammer dat het wel dvd9 is..
maar tog blijft het een super cool upload!!
thanks:-)"
,pinobigbird,2007-12-09T12:24Z,@debeenl: Top! Currently I'm at 7.3% for this release. Looking forward to your season 1 release :-)
,deebeenl,2007-12-09T13:32Z,"Sorry for the speed. I am uploading at 80 Kb/s, but that's divided by the amount of concurrent leechers. Hopefully speeds will pick up once the amount of seeders will increase. 

This torrent is running from a spare server, which is (normally) up 24/7. So far I've uploaded 5 GB since yesterday, so bear with me until it's finished (and seed after!)"
,pinobigbird,2007-12-16T14:46Z,"I'm @ 62.5%, ETA of 5 days. But it's worth waiting. 8-]"
,deebeenl,2007-12-16T15:23Z,"Yeah I know. So far, uploadcounter is at 53 GB already :-)

Too bad you can't redirect all speed to 2-3 people, so they have complete versions as well."
,pinobigbird,2007-12-20T14:17Z,"Complete!! Thank you again! I will continue seeding.

I hope you will release season 1 as well."
,deebeenl,2007-12-24T15:21Z,"Uploaded 110 (!) GB so far... too bad there is only one other seeder.

If you've downloaded this file, please keep seeding. "
,deebeenl,2007-12-28T13:30Z,"Great, there are 5 other seeders. I need the HD space, so I'm offline for now. 

I'll probably buy a NAS 500 GB HD soon in January, afterwards I'll continue the upload.

Happy New Year!"
,senior55,2008-01-12T02:50Z,"wow, dat wordt lang wachten voor ik deze upload compleet binnen heb, maar bedankt"
,gillerbee,2008-01-23T19:06Z,"heb je je nieuwe harde schijffie al, want ik heb em nog niet binnen en dat seeden van de boys hier is niet echt supersnel ;-)"
,Xandertje19,2008-01-26T21:56Z,Wat gaaf man deze ontbreekt nog in mijn collectie nu seizoen 3 nog en dan is het helemaal top :) olee
,Rotzooi007,2008-03-31T11:56Z,"How to burn the .iso files? I tried with Nero 7, Nero 8, Alcohol and some other (for me not known) apps, but nothing seems to work! 

PS. in het nederlands antwoorden mag ook hoor!"

@ Uploader

,2311,2008-06-26T11:28Z,"Super upload, thx. I'm looking forward to season 3 !"
,2311,2008-10-07T22:28Z,"Hej, I was wondering if have season 3? With the same quallity? thx !"
,Nicolas1802,2009-07-09T17:52Z,"Nice Upload.

I'm currently at 22%, 7 seeders.

Can DVD9 be burned to a normal 4.7 GB dvd?"
,deebeenl,2009-07-25T20:28Z,"Not directly. You'll need DVD 9 to burn this. You can offcourse decrease the quality and then burn to DVD 5.

But then again, I normally would go for the highest quality (as I have a big ass TV :-)"
