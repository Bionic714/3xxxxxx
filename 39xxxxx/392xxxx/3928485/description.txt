Rockefeller Tells Clinton to Tell All About UFOs (press report) 
New York Daily News, August 24th, 1995 

Summary: President Clinton is being pressured to reopen supersecret government files on the world's most baffling UFO incident. The man who wants the secrecy ended is billionaire philanthropist Laurance S. Rockerfeller, a personal friend of the president. 

"Billionaire Urges Clinton: Probe UFO Mystery" 

President Clinton is being pressured to reopen supersecret government files on the world's most baffling UFO incident. The man who wants the secrecy ended is billionaire philanthropist Laurance S. Rockerfeller, a personal friend of the president. UFO experts believe the government covered up a UFO crash in 1947 near Roswell, N.M., from which alien bodies were recovered. this mystery was the basis of a highly-rated show on the Fox television network which was repeated Sept. 5. "Many are convinced that Roswell marks the beginning of government secret about UFO's" says Rockerfeller in a letter to the White House obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. "Whatever the truth of Roswell, a definitive statement about it from the government would be very important." the letter continues. 

Rockerfeller hosted President Clinton at his western ranch during the chief executive's recent vacation in Jackson Hole, Wyoming - and insiders believe he bent Clinton's ear about the UFO issue. He also wrote to President Clinton's science advisor, John Gibbons, to urge that all UFO-related information be released. UFO enthusiasts have long cited the Roswell incident as the most blatant example of government cover-up. They claim that after an alien space craft crashed, the bodies of the ET visitors were autopsied and then secretly flown to an Air Force base in Ohio. In his letter to the White House, Rockerfeller suggests that a cover-up may very well have been imposed by jittery bureaucrats. "While much in the public sector has been written about it, the govt. has had nothing to say about it .." says Rockerfeller. He called on the President to promise there would be no persecution for those coming forward and revealing their eyewitness accounts of the New Mexico incident. "In addition to lifting classification about Roswell, consideration should be given to granting amnesty on an individual basis to allow those with knowledge about the incident to speak without fear of prosecution: There is a reason to believe that there are individuals who would provide information about the incident under that circumstance." 

The Roswell Incident has been repeatedly dismissed by the Defense Dept.

(the following text is from http://www.presidentialufo.com/part5.htm

Even though the President had the interest and will to take on the UFO problem, he found that once elected, that he and his elected officials were being cut out of the government UFO process. The President found himself forced to gather information on the subject from researchers outside the government, intelligence, and military. These outsiders were given the green light to brief Clinton?s top staffers.

This situation of being exiled from the information necessary to deal with the issue caused the Clinton great frustration. Years later Sarah McClendon, a senior White House reporter, substantiated the President?s great frustration over UFOs, and the cause for it.

McClendon told Dr. Greer that she had, at one point, put the question of UFO secrecy to Clinton. She asked the President why he didn?t just do something to disclose the truth about UFOs. McClendon said that the President leaned over to her and in response to her question said, "Sarah, there?s a secret government within the government, and I have no control over it."

(the following text is from Steven Greer's book Hidden Truth - Forbidden Knowledge)

"In the case of Bill Clinton, he very much wanted to see this happen but didn't have the courage to do it. His legacy was basically lost, because it was his responsibility, as the first full-term president after the close of the Cold War era, to have done this. He didn't rise to the challenge."

"A major New York paper was set to run a story about briefings for the White House and CIA director on UFOs. The very day they were going to run that story, Linda Tripp emerged with her stories about Monica Lewinsky. This was not an accident or a coincidence."

(the following is a press release from The Disclosure Project from November 13th 2007)

Note to all those receiving this second Disclosure Project press release entitled "Insiders Expose Reasons for UFO Secrecy". Please note that two paragraphs - those referring to Laurence Rockefeller and to Bill and Hillary Clinton - have been removed from the second one. The service we use for sending out press releases: PRNewswire.com refused to send out the original press release with those references. It was referred up the chain of command at their organization and censored by them. When you think that we have a free press, think again. This was not even censored by the outlets themselves, but by the entry point to those outlets!

INSIDERS EXPOSE REASONS FOR SECRECY (Revised)

Washington, DC

Disclosure Project (www.DisclosureProject.org) Director Dr. Steven M. Greer reports that government insiders have revealed the existence of a shadowy, highly classified program related to UFOs.

The reasons for the secrecy are simple: The inertia of highly classified programs, embarrassment over past illegal actions taken to enforce secrecy, and the fact that the energy and propulsion systems behind the mysterious UFO objects have been studied and fully understood. This disclosure would spell the end for oil, gas, coal and other conventional forms of power - and with that, the end of the current oil-based geopolitical order and economy. The truth is our tax dollars have been used to investigate this matter for decades and it is time for a dividend on that investment. The full disclosure of the facts will enable humanity to attain a sustainable civilization without global warming or the need for oil.

Recent calls for a US government investigation into UFOs have not taken into account the fact that such investigations are on-going, highly compartmented and top-secret.

Dr. Greer states "As early as 1993, when I personally briefed CIA Director James Woolsey on the UFO matter, we knew of on-going, secret projects to which President Clinton and Mr. Woolsey were denied access. The senior counsel for the Senate Appropriations Committee, then headed by Senator Byrd (D-WV) told me directly that upwards of $100 billion per year was going into so-called ?black? projects, including UFO programs, but that with a top-secret clearance and a subpoena power, he could not penetrate the veil of secrecy."

Since then, The Disclosure Project has uncovered thousands of official US documents and over 400 top-secret military and corporate witnesses to programs dealing with UFOs, along with project code names and numbers. Such operations are rogue and deny access to Congressional oversight committees.

The Disclosure Project is calling for open hearings in the Congress and UN so that these whistle-blowers may testify. Previous government/civilian panels, such as the Condon Committee of 1969, proved to be white-wash operations and were penetrated by CIA involvement. Dr. Greer states "We feel that an open hearing process would be the best avenue for our democracy to reassert control over these rogue operations. We have hundreds of heroic government whistle-blowers who need to be heard."

** Paradigm Research Group has archived a great deal of other information related to this little-known story, The Rockefeller Initiative, including several articles from mainstream publications. http://paradigmresearchgroup.org/Rockefeller%20Documents/Rockefeller_Initiative_Documents.htm  Stephen Bassett is hopeful that this topic will be brought up and put directly to Hilary Clinton during her presidential campaign.
