,BloodLogic,2007-12-13T18:45Z,"I'm always keeping my eyes out for stuff that isn't on the network yet.  If anyone wants to download some of my other torrents, check out my TPB profile.  I only upload full seasons, plus new stuff all the time!

,Hulloder,2007-12-14T08:07Z,"Great upload, thanks"
,BloodLogic,2007-12-21T00:43Z,"If you're a fan of this show, Doug, then I highly recommend the show O'Grady.  Not only is it also family-friend and teen-oriented, but it's also much more creative.  Like Doug, it's also about kids going through high school.  Enjoy the full seasons 1-2 (with extras) of O'Grady from this torrent...

,jokersmkweed,2010-10-18T02:30Z,"Finally got it to download. Thanks Bloodlogic. It would have been better if it was in 800x600 or higher, but rare find."
,The_Wx13,2011-01-14T14:42Z,So awesome.
,KGN-004,2011-09-07T04:38Z,"Very bad quality. Nowadays you can find DVD rips of all the episodes.

(I'm not writing these ""very bad quality"" comments on all your torrents to spite you, or anything. It's just a lot of these '90s shows have had official DVD releases (and scene rips of them) in the 2~5 years since these collections were made. Just warning people not to waste their time, since there's better rips out there now.)"
,noname-the-alien,2012-01-01T01:26Z,"Why is the Disney ""Doug"" so hard to find? It may not have been Nickelodeons' ""Doug"" but I still liked it!

I haven't found any torrent with all of the Disney ""Doug"" episodes."
,itzktbaby,2012-08-16T09:46Z,Says there is 45 seeders but yet it won't download? Doesn't even show me the files? Anyone else having problems with downloading this?
