,Boomer-III,2007-12-15T00:18Z,"oh yeah, don't buy anything from Macy's either!"
,Boomer-III,2007-12-15T00:38Z,"I WAS WRONG, THANK YOU ! 

this is a real torrent, it extracted WITHOUT any password, and it was a fast download too!  Thank you, and MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERY ONE!"
,hatedkeroua,2007-12-17T12:26Z,"BS! Password Protected and he wants you to go to his Macys Free Gift sight to get the password. Waste of Time, don't get your hopes up."
,Pot8oHead,2007-12-17T14:17Z,"It's a .rar within a .rar.  The second .rar extracts without the password, but the .mp3s in THAT require a pw for extracting.  Anyone know what it is?  Either way, Torrentazos can go fuck himself."
,kenguard,2007-12-17T21:00Z,"The Macy's password on another download I got was 'kit?'  (that's kit plus the question mark, no apostrophies). It's stupid and it was hard to figure out. You go to the Macy's site, put in a fake email addy and the word before the ? is kit.  Why do such a dumb ass thing is beyond me, but I hope it helps."
