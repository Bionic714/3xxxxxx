,zero-kill,2008-02-26T03:35Z,"It's not *by* them, it is their cover of the song =]"
,jazo_7,2008-05-24T20:15Z,"Dunno if it's just me but some song on ""make youself"" are corrupt (crackling in the middle of the song and/or just silence)"
,oldnewtype,2008-06-30T18:17Z,"So you all know, the song ""Naked"" isn't Incubus at all, its Faith No More's recording of their song ""Naked in front of the Computer"""
,rarson,2008-08-08T08:17Z,"No, Incubus didn't do a cover of ""Turning Japanese.""  Listen to the mp3, it's not them.  Check out http://incubus-online-view.com/ if you don't believe me.

Nor is the song ""Jump Around,"" which is a live Limp Bizkit cover."
,nidster,2009-08-08T14:26Z,and jump around is not by incubus nor limp bizkit it was originaly by house of pain.
,thegregger11,2010-02-06T18:34Z,"we know, dude. it's called a cover"
