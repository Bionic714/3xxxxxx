Rebel band Eire Og have produced an album worthy of any rebel band and in
the traditionof old Ireland.
Rebel songs are a part of Irish history and will live on well after we are all passed on and
peace reigns again in the beautiful emerald isle.
Eire Og's album tells the history of the Irish peoples struggle for a free Ireland, its battles and its heroes.
The band perform these songs with great pride and a love for all that is Irish, you can just feel the pain and the hatred as it flows from such great song as "Sunday Bloody Sunday, and " Boys Of The Old Brigade" but if I had to pick one song from this great rebel album that for me would say what rebel music is all about it would be
"Let the People Sing take it down from the Mast this Land is Your land"
and when played by these guys you can imagine yourself out there doing your bit for your country.
This is a real get up andshout it out album played and sung by some great musicians
This album is certainly an eye opener if you don't know much about
thestruggle for independencein Ireland. It is an education in itself.
In recent years rebel music has become more popular and Eire Og have most certainly helped to do this and keep the history of Irelands great musical tradition alive.
This album is a must for all lover of Irish rebel music.
