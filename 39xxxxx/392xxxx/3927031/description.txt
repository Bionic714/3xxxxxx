----------------------------------------------
Function:

This is pretty basic software designed for folks 
like me who use their computer for just about 
everything... including an ad-hoc alarm clock.
Uses practically no resources, is absolutely tiny
by comparison to other products, and is super 
fast. 

Future:

Implementing of screen blanking tool with integrated
'wake up' screen, as well as more 'use from your 
bed/couch' functionality.
