The J. Geils Band, an American group, was formed in Boston in 1969. They fuse together the elements of rock'n'roll, blues and rhythm and blues and developed into one of the most important and popular live bands in the USA. In live concerts, the group surpasses their recordings in spite of some of their LPs becoming, in the meantime, rock classics. The J. Geils Band was at their peak in 1978 with the LP 'Sanctuary' and the Rockpalast concert the following year. They were special guests of the Rolling Stones; extended tours throughout the USA, Japan and Europe followed.

The J. Geils Band arrived in DÃ¼sseldorf and was picked up at the airport by Christian and Peter. On the trip to Essen in a comfortable conference bus, Peter Wolf made one thing clear: "We didn't come to try out German beer. And not for the German 'Frolleins', either. We've come to work for you!!!" That was apparent at the rehearsal. The band played through their whole concert many times, and with energy output at 150%. Peter Wolf worked up the few people standing around just as intensively as he did the 9000 on the next day. And then came the question to all of Europe: "Are you ready for the J. Geils Band?" - the loud-mouthed tour manager even forgot his speech impediment. And the answer was a many-voiced YES. Then it got under the skin. Peter Wolf swam in the multitude. Enthusiasm without limits.
