This was the last of the ten or so movie soundtracks that Tangerine Dream produced in the 1980s. The film Miracle Mile is something of a cult classic borne out of the US vs. Soviets face-off of the Reagan era, wherein a pre-E.R. Anthony Edwards accidentally intercepts information of imminent nuclear war. At this point, Tangerine Dream were a duo: Edgar Froese and Paul Haslinger, who had joined the band several years earlier with Underwater Sunlight.

Squeaky clean synths play almost exclusively in minor keys, exhibiting a sense of urgency throughout meant to convey time running down in the movie. In its favor, I would say Miracle Mile sounds less incontrovertibly dated than some of their albums of just a few years earlier. Perhaps this is due to a lesser encroachment of drum programming overall, and better, less intrusive percussive sounds when these are employed.
