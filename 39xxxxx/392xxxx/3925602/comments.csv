,benclimb,2007-12-08T12:38Z,Is that the old (1.0) or new version (1.1) of the map?
,Emmertje,2007-12-08T13:46Z,"Dunnow, maps are of June 2006"
,rimorimo,2007-12-09T23:13Z,"Thanks emmertje, It works well."
,rimorimo,2008-02-02T00:51Z,"Thanks, it works very well on my 60CSx. good job"
,missyou71,2008-02-20T21:32Z,It's version 1.0. Version 1.1 has some enhancements - especially the buildings are better visible. Anyone could provide the newer version  ?
,davehb,2008-03-14T20:32Z,"merci, je n'ai pas encore mon gps 60CSx.Je suppose que les cartes se lisent avec le programmes de garmin ??ou un autre ??"
,HydroPhil,2008-05-19T10:01Z,"Thanks a lot, an update to version 1.1 would be great, though."
,HydroPhil,2008-06-16T14:38Z,i now have access to swiss topo version 1.1 but i'm missing a 16-char installation key of the form xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx to even get the installer going. is there a keygen? thanks.
,alterfurz,2008-06-23T12:21Z,Use Jetmouse to generate a unique key for your device.  Can you point me to 1.1?
,HydroPhil,2008-06-27T14:21Z,"the keygen by jetmouse only generates the 25-char unlock codes for already installed maps or for mapsource products that don't need an installation key, like city navigator europe 2008 nt. swiss topo on the other hand requests a 16-char installation key to get the installer going."
,arnaud.ch,2008-07-25T08:55Z,"Hi there, I install this Swiss TOPO exe file, that generates me the img files (without key) on my pc. I cannot start Mapsource anymore without uninstalling the swisstopo :-( Seems there is no mdx file extracted? How do you send the topo to the gps? simple copy/paste? which folder then? thanks! Is there btw rev1.1 somewhere?"
,alterfurz,2008-09-15T11:08Z,"Garmin Topo Schweiz can be found on the newsgroup alt.binaries.boneless.  Search for ""Garmin Topo Schweiz.part.par2 yEnc""  This is version 1.10, consists of six .rar files totalling 255mb."
