He lives on in the hearts of fans all over the world who know that was more than a man with a message. The lyrics and kindness in his voice speak to the Rainbow Family [according to our government, they are the 2nd most watched 'terrorist' organization' in the U.S.] and their way of life. And, no, it's nothing homosexual, check it out at http://www.welcomehere.org/. The official Rainbow Family website used to be welcomehome.org but if you type that in now you'll be redirected to the White House' web page.

Peace & Love,
Stevo "
