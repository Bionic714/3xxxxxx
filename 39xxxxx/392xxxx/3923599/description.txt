The story of Rannulph Junnah, a promising young golfer who loses his swing after he experiences the harrowing frontlines of war. Once considered Savannah's greatest sportsman and favorite celebrity, Junnah had won the heart of the town's prettiest heiress, Adele Invergordon. But when he returned from war, he was a defeated man, giving up both golf and Adele for the sake of alcohol.
When Junnah is given a chance to redeem himself by competing in a celebrity golf tournament, he must first regain his swing and his self-respect. It will take a miracle, in the form of a mysterious caddy named Bagger Vance, for Junnah to get his game back as well as his life.
