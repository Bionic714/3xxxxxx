PLOT:
In 1958, David Moran (Daniel Manche) becomes enchanted by Megan Loughlin (Blythe Auffarth),
the sweet girl whose parents died in a tragic car accident. Megan and her younger sister
Susan (Madeline Taylor) are adopted by her aunt Ruth (Blanche Baker), an abusive single mom
to three boys. Although Megan calls the cops on Ruth, no charges are ever filed and,
for retaliation, the teenage girl gets tied up in the bomb shelter in the basement.
Can David do anything to spare the suffering of his first crush?


In this town murder became the neighborhood game


"The first authentically shocking American film I've seen since Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer over 20 years ago. If you are easily disturbed, you should not watch this movie. If, on the other hand, you are prepared for a long look into hell, suburban style, The Girl Next Door will not disappoint.
This is the dark-side-of-the-moon version of Stand By Me." - Stephen King

iMDB: If you are looking for a horror movie and don't have heart problem
then watching it should be a priority just expect to feel horrible afterwards...

Enjoy!?
