,brokensea,2007-12-26T18:39Z,The book was freaky.  The film just as disturbed.
,constantregret,2008-03-13T01:03Z,"thanks. if this story interests you, a film called ""an american crime"" based on the true story that inspired this book/movie will be released on showtime in the near future. i also recommend you read a book called ""indiana torture slaying"" which basically discusses everything that went down and the court room drama thereafter."
,daZzz,2008-03-19T02:47Z,"This Movie is twisted as hell.. omfg the scene at 01.16.09 where Ruth burns out the tortured girls clitoris with a bunsen burner thing..
Fucking sick and twisted, i would love to smack that ruth a few times!

If you're looking for shocking this is the movie!"

,captaincritic,2009-06-18T22:13Z,this is a good movie but if you watch it more than once your a pretty sick individual.  
,captaincritic,2009-06-18T22:15Z,smartpatrol  I would love to wrap my hands around your neck you sick little bitch
,WandySan,2009-11-05T09:22Z,Shocking but nicely filmed. Anybody knows what happened to those boys and woman? Somebody tell me they were caught and boiled in oil.
,FearTheUndead,2009-12-24T09:26Z,"The real story is about Slyvia Likens. The ""aunt"" is actually Gertrude Baniszewski. as previously stated, watch ""An American Crime"" for the actual story. Although much is still left out. No names are changed to protect the guilty.

Search Slyvia Likens & Gertrude on wikipedia for the whole account. It's much worse than this movie could portray.

Slyvia Marie Likens (01/03/49-10/26/65) R.I.P."

,ToxicPinkPoison,2010-06-10T01:59Z,The book was a must read
,kissing_hitler,2011-01-17T03:07Z,"I masturbate to this movie on a daily basis.
Thank you Jesus."
,LoFreq.,2011-06-24T14:31Z,Thanks to everyone who ran their yap about the film content or for some reason the book it was based on while not mentioning at all the quality of the torrent.
,rowkem,2011-08-01T06:05Z,"Great movie depicting a simply horrible event. Then again, the movie doesn't even come close to the atrocities Sylvia had to endure; here's a few:

- forced to beat her own sister
- having scalding water and salt rubbed into wounds
- forced to eat her own feces

Sylvia eventually died during an ordeal after being bludgeoned; she suffered a brain hemorrhage and died on October 26th 1965. A truly sad story.

Anyways, to comment on the video itself.

The quality is quite good. It's certainly not HD but, I wouldn't put it any worse than standard definition. I played it on a 46"" TV and had little to no concerns or issues. Good sound too.

,ninjasquirrel81,2011-08-12T14:40Z,"If the uploader ever comes back and see this, I say thank you.

After reading your comments on the movie I decided to go find Portrait of a Serial Killer and watched it.. absolutely brilliant film, best I have seen in a long, long, time. 

Too bad it's 25 years old now, really shows that at least in one point in time hollywood had tallent."
,mrdot,2012-01-05T18:09Z,what a beautiful movie.
,hed_pe11,2012-02-17T09:45Z,great video but the audio is really quiet.....
,chaitanya89,2012-07-03T20:08Z,"firstly, Thanks for the upload.
