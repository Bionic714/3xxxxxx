Had some really good memories with it!

Thanks alot for sharing (I don`t say that alot.)

I've been sitting on these images for some time now.  Finally got around to sharing them.  I'll seed until it becomes well established.

,swamy,2008-01-29T01:02Z,Thanks for upping all 9 Panzer Campaigns. These old games are fantastic. I just wish there were some more seeders to keep the speed up.
