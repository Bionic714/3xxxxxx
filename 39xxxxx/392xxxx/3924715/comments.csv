,VictorDTarsus,2007-12-15T08:30Z,"I have always loved the games and all three movies were awesome! Especially RE2 which was filmed right across the street from me when I lived in Toronto, ON, Canada in 2003/2004 and at the building I went to school at was the scene were the officers come across the empty weapons cases left by the Nemesis character. See tha huge green thing in the back ground? Thats the CBC World HQ elevator in the CBC Building in downtown Toronto. I used that elevator daily for school on the 8th floor."
