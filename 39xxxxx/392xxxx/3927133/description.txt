The Gunslinger is the first volume in Stephen King's famous Dark Tower series and was originally published in 1982. The book was later revised and it is that revision that is usually heard today. This is the original, unrevised version read by the incomparable Frank Muller.

King claims that it took 12 years to write this (relatively short) novel. It was first published in serial form in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in the following five parts:
    1. Oct 1978 "The Gunslinger"
    2. Apr 1980 "The Way Station"
    3. Feb 1981 "The Oracle and the Mountains"
    4. Jul 1981 "The Slow Mutants"
    5. Nov 1981 "The Gunslinger and the Dark Man"

This audiobook includes an interesting afterword written before The Drawing of the Three was completed.

Publisher's blurb:
Eerie, dreamlike, set in a world that is weirdly related to our own, The Gunslinger introduces Roland Deschain of Gilead, of In-World that was, as he pursues his enigmatic antagonist to the mountains that separate the desert from the Western Sea. Roland is a solitary figure, perhaps accursed, who with a strange singlemindedness traverses an exhausted, almost timeless landscape. The people he encounters are left behind, or worse - left dead. At a way station, however, he meets Jake, a boy from a particular time (1977) and a particular place (New York City), and soon the two are joined - khef, ka, and ka-tet. The mountains lie before them. So does the man in black and, somewhere far beyond... the Dark Tower.
