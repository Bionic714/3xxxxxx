,molasseskat,2007-12-10T00:29Z,very frustrating - I have found one place already where 4.5 pages are skipped (the end of piece 3).  There may be more.
,KDerrida,2007-12-14T09:25Z,Thanks so much. The original has been so hard to find.
,sneeblewhopp,2008-01-06T01:15Z,"I would love to see his complete ""Dark Tower"" series all bundled into one torrent in audio book form! They never made a movie, yet in my opinion...it's his masterpiece. I thought it ended on book like 7 or so...called ""The Dark Tower"", but now I hear he's making what is to be the last....called ""The Long Road Home""...book 8 I believe. They'll release the new book in March of 08. "
