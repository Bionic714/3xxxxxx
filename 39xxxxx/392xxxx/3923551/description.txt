Cage plays Rick Santoro, a flamboyant Atlantic City police detective who's come to watch the fight and cash in on the hectic betting action. Suddenly, gunfire cuts down a ringside government official, and 14,000 fans suddenly become 14,000 suspects. What eyewitnesses saw, what a casino-wide spycam network reveals and what a mysterious woman in white knows-all lead to a shattering truth Santoro does not want to believe.
