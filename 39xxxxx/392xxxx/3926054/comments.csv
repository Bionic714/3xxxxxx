,weardlan,2007-12-08T21:13Z,"it's pr0n because..... statistically there's a probability that someone somewhere in one of those buildings is having sex ? long distance amateur porn?

or maybe if you squint in the right way the statue on the left looks like a big willy?

The disc in the upper left is definitely a nipple clamp.

and the car park below that is a well known downtown Baghdad dogging spot.

Or maybe it's the CIA Secretly sending Pics to operatives and it's really Tehran and it's about to get bombed?

Hello echelon ANALyzers

Now it's porn *AND* terrorism."
