,xman2007,2007-12-17T01:34Z,"Excellent stuff thanks. Been trying to gey my mygiude to work with tomtom maps but this has sorted it. The special voices is a great touch gonna try Al paciono. The next step is to run a media player on the myguide. Anyone know how to do this. I have ceplayer on the thing but can't get it too play anything?
Thanks again."
,wishmasteruk,2007-12-23T11:49Z,"ok make a back up of your flash folder, download the myguide 3000 update, install it on your nav, this will give you a movie player,mp3 player and picture viewer, copy your backup files back to flash (this is because the 3000 version of the navigation dose not work on myguide 3100) and your done. let me know how you get on. hope this helps"

,reddragon2282,2008-01-19T00:20Z,Hi I've just had one of these Myguide 3100 to me and would like to use the software you have posted to update my system.  I'm new to this so could I possibly have an idiots guide to the installation and setup needed to make this work.  Cheers for all your help
,reddragon2282,2008-01-19T00:21Z,Forgot to say do I need an SD card or can it all be done using a usb transfer cable.  I have both was just wondering whats best
,homer4king,2008-01-19T02:03Z,"@ reddragon2282 You may need either a sd card reader just insert the sd card into the card reader and copy everything in the folder to your card and it will work.Or to use the usb cable get a program called activesync http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/activesync/activesync45.mspx 
 then just run it click explore and copy and paste all the contents from the folder to your sd card and it should work.Then press the reset button on the back of your myguide to start it."
,reddragon2282,2008-02-13T01:16Z,Hi I downloaded everything and got myself a 2 gig sd card with adatpter to enable me to copy the files I get the buttons both TomTom and IGO but when I press them it comes up with a filename pathway error can you help with this.  I bet this is a very straight forward thing thst I am missing
,reddragon2282,2008-02-13T01:44Z,and are the latest maps in this download
,reddragon2282,2008-02-13T02:45Z,preferably tomtom maps 
,xxJADEYxx,2008-02-19T21:29Z,hey i reall need help on this my sd is only 256mb which is not big enough to install this file so what do i do? sorry im a newbie and im confused
,wishmasteruk,2008-02-27T23:19Z,"@reddragon2282
make sure all files from zip are in root folder of sd card and not in sub folders, map will be out of date by now but go to the links in read me for updated maps


@ xxJADEYxx
unzip all files to sd card excluding IGO folder this will give you just tom tom software(you need to edit addons to remove igo button) if you want both you will need a 512mb sd minimum"
,wishmasteruk,2008-02-28T18:13Z,"@reddragon2282

try resetting too

@ xxJADEYxx

just got this working on 256mb card you will have to delete sum of the voices for this to fit if you get stuck let me know"
,johnjohnblahblah,2008-03-10T20:34Z,"Slightly O/T but wondered if anyone could offer any help..I've plugged in my GPS (Myguide3100) to update maps/scdb, it syncs and connects but when i click on explore (Microsoft Autosync) its not finding any files (my sd card) and i get the message ""critical communications services have failed, try resetting the mobile device and try again"". I have tried resetting by its not made any difference."

,hedleylamarr,2009-06-02T23:58Z,"I have anold Myguide 3050.  Is there a way to get new N.America maps and voices for it?  Will the 3100 files work??  I have browsed the forum and didn't see anything about a 3050.
Thanks....:)"
,lahaugen,2009-12-07T23:45Z,Will these voices work on any TomTom GPS? I'd imagine I should be able to copy them straight over to a TomTom XL 340S I would think and not use the Ireland and UK maps. Any advice? Thanks guys!
