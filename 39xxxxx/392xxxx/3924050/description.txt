==PLOT=====================>


Episode 9: DEATHWALKER
Extradite her for trial! Better yet, some say, kill her on the spot! Passions 
run high with the arrival of the war criminal know as Deathwalker. She's 
bioscientist Jha'dur, whose discovery of an immortality potion came via 
sadistic experimentation on Narns and other aliens. 

Episode 10: BELIEVERS 
Medicine vs. faith - and Sinclair must decide. The station's vital neutrality 
policy is at risk if medical chief Franklin performs an operation to save a 
child but violates the ancient alien religion of the child's parents. 

Episode 11: SURVIVORS
He's made many enemies and now Garibaldi's future is on the line. Framed for 
sabotage, the embattled security chief flees to the station's seamy Downbelow. 
Only one person can be relied upon: Sinclair, the commander he's loyally 
served for years. 

Episode 12: BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY
Sinclair must bring Solomon-like wisdom to mediate disputes large and small. 
The small: G'Kar and Londo find a new way to continue their running feud. 
The large: a strike by dockworkers threatens the station.
