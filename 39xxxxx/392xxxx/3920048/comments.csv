,feliperibeiros,2008-03-16T00:01Z,"Hey guis!
I'm using the Mac OS X 10.5.2 and the password us! worked for me. But just with Stuffit Expander (right click/ open with../ Stuffit Expander). When I tried to open it with Stuffit Mananger (the second rar file), for some reason the password worked, but the files don't came out.

Oh, don't forget to open the rar inside the rar.
