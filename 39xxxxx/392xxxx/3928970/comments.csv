either of these:

http://open.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce
http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce

Just stop the torrent, add them & see if reconnecting fixes.

And thank you for the effort."

What do you mean with this. I add the tracker TPB asked me to nd uploaded it. I´m seeding, there´s people getting it. What more should I do. thanks."
,hockpooh,2007-12-11T05:55Z,"File name said nothing to me. It reads 10.4.10 Combo. Not sure what jaS and sse3 mean.

If this is just the normal combo updater why not get it from the Apple site.

The Tiger OS is up to 10.4.11 and even though I have Leopard I'm not installing it because of all the problems."
,plprado,2007-12-11T06:43Z,If you´re not sure what it is do not download it.
,hockpooh,2007-12-11T22:33Z,OK secret agent man. I won't download it. I've been keeping my eyes open for a solid way with not much trouble to put Mac OS X on a PC so I can buy a cheaper but awesome PC and run OS X on it.
,plprado,2007-12-14T14:57Z,"Well, I din´t mean to be rude. Just wanted to warn you since if you didn't know what it was you could end up screwing something up in your comp. But I guess you know what this is, so I´m sorry if I ""sounded"" rude.

cheers."
,plprado,2007-12-14T15:03Z,"One more thing:

people, let´s seed this after you download it, huh?
At least to 1.0 ratio.
Thanks to all and good luck."
