,mikey90,2007-12-11T19:22Z,"Did they make just 11 episodes to season 2?? Weird, itÂ´s not much!!! Usually there is like 22-23 episodes in one season.... By the way when season 3 starts?"
,kid-phlip,2007-12-14T17:02Z,mikey90 - in case you have not been watching the news or reading a paper the U.S. Screen Writters Guild is on Strike... i.e. No Writters... No episodes. The last time this happened in the 80's the U.S. Television industry was crippeled for 17 months. Get used to re-runs until this is resolved. The strike started in early november and the TV industry had only filmed episodes through till the middle of most seasons. So until the writters go back to work we will have the longest fucking cliff-hangers on most of our shows.
