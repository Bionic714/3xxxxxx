Samuel Edward "Sam" Makin (played by Fred Ward) is a tough street cop recruited as a secret agent through a bizarre method: his death is faked so that there will be no questions asked as to his disappearance. Rechristened "Remo Williams" (after the name and location of the manufacturer of the bedpan in Makin's hospital room), his face is surgically altered and he is trained to be a human killing machine by his aged Korean martial arts master Chiun (played by Grey in heavy makeup). Though Remo's training is extremely rushed by Chiun's standards, Remo learns such skills as dodging bullets. The Chiun character, who is stereotypically nationalistic, racist and sexist, is both the comic relief and wise mentor figure in the film. Chiun and Remo practice a fictional form of Korean martial arts named Sinanju. Remo is sent to investigate a corrupt weapons procurement program within the US Army.
