James Carter (Chris Tucker) once again reunites with Chinese 
Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) to both taunt and battle bad guys. 
Whereas the first movie was on Carter's turf, and the second 
was set in Lee's homeland, this outing finds both Carter and 
Lee out of their element in Paris, dealing not only with criminals, 
but also with the quirks of French culture. Along the way, Lee 
must confront his brother Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) in order to 
save the day. Funnier and More Action-Packed Then It's Predecessors.


Cast: Chris Tucker, Jackie Chan, Max von Sydow, Noemie Lenoir.
