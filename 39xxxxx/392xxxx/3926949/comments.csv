,slick_fother_muck3r,2007-12-09T03:15Z,My bad.. This is actually a DVD ISO of the movie.  Not a rip.
,slick_fother_muck3r,2007-12-09T03:19Z,"I was just really tierd when I posted this.  It's made into ISO with DVD decrypter.  Since the running time is like 12-17mins, the actual DVD ISO is only 750MB or so uncompressed.  

This is not a DIVX or XVID or OGM.  It's just a regular DVD that you will burn with Nero or DVD Decrypter.  

So this is in the correct catagory.  I just made a mistake explaining.  ( I meant DVD rip as made into ISO.)"
