» Review:

Legendary H8000 sxe band featuring Hans Liar's sis, Saskia Verbeke on vocals, together with members of Regression... Great atmospheric metal with melodic (non-screaming) vocals. Great record. Understand why any band with a female singer takes Shortsight as an example nowadays. Ahead of it's time !
