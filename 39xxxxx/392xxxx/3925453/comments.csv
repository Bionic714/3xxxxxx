Try adding it to your download client and you will get the error."

,xrh74s,2008-12-03T04:26Z,"WARNING! Do not download, as it will corrupt your download path and cause error to your Gnutella device.  Then gives you a message 100% progress with ""Disk Problem"" message to where you can't find nor locate the dam file is... And when you do find it at the ""INCOMPLETE"" folder, deleting it would be a futile cause it will reappear again there each time you turn on your Gnutella device. "
