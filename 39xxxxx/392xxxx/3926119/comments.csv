,Discordia666,2007-12-08T11:53Z,"Bullshit, you need to enter a serial every time you start a new game.

Buy the game, it's worth it!"

1. oOmegav2o, you dont know me xD
2. Discordia666, I purchased the Box+Download thingy. And you dont need any serial to start a new game, beacause you dont have any at that point! Try it your self?"
,oOmegav2o,2007-12-09T01:40Z,"Lololol?  Your a faggot, shut the fuck up and stop uploading things.  This guy lives two blocks away from me, and this is all he does, is make fake programs, filled with viruses.  Hes a fucking loser with no friends, and AIDS."
,SyntaXe1,2007-12-09T16:12Z,"Omfg.
I dont know you, but I have rights to upload wtf I want. You just piss of. Your just a fat lonely kid that lives in a basement with your alcoholic mother!"
,taiiat,2008-01-07T21:04Z,"howabout both of you guys stfu? by discordia, this is a fake torrent, and it has to be viruses if its not the game. as for the other guy, i dunno, but both of  guys are sad."
,cLtmstr,2008-01-13T08:34Z,"No viruses. 

This is a great version and I don't really get it why all of you are saying there is viruses. I have checked with about every virus program there is, and there isnt anything."
