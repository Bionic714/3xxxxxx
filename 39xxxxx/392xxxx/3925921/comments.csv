,joybringer,2007-12-08T08:28Z,"Great! Been waiting for this one for quite a while.

Amazing list of Uploads by the way.. Awsome.

Wish you would reseed La cicatrice interieure...

:)"
[T],oddeven,2007-12-08T16:21Z,"joybringer - you might have tried to leave me a note on one of my torrents.  When you thought cicatrice was out of seeders there was still a seeder there.  I will see what I can do, but I hope I am doing this for more than just you.  I seeded it 5 or 6 times before I stopped..."
,thekolo,2007-12-22T07:07Z,"I'm having trouble getting the subtitles to show up as burn it to dvd.  ConvertX to DVD dosn't display the subtitles, TMPGenc flat out refuses to import the subtitle file at all, and when I tried to hard code the subtitles with AVIrecomp over 50% of the subtitles don't show up. 

I know I am doing something wrong, any help please?"
[T],clownmonkey,2008-01-05T18:03Z,"@thekolo: I probably saved the .srt file in Unicode instead of ANSI format (because of the extended character set).  Try opening the .srt file in Notebook or similar text editor, save it in ANSI format, and then see if your MPEG2 converters will work."

,Skunk420,2011-07-15T05:37Z,"the video and audio is very good quality, but i'm having trouble trying to get the subs to work properly. they either work partially or not at all"
,.KRAAG.,2012-08-15T12:08Z,"Agreed, the subtitles are not synchronised properly with the audio.
