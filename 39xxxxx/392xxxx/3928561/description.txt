This is a concept album. In the autumn of 2005 I learned how to record on my computer by making thirty songs about cats that were all less than a minute in length. It took me about three weeks.

In the summer of 2006, I decided to make another one about exotic cats and only came up with six more songs, which i tacked onto the other thirty and released online for free download. This is that version.

Since its release, it has spawned some guys I don't know to write two other albums called Thirty-Seven Songs About Dogs and Thirty-Eight Songs About Sharks.
