,Gefretepah,2008-08-22T11:36Z," For those of you who still can't afford computer protection I offer a suggestion. Lot's of security programs offer bits and pieces of their protection for free and an unlimited amount of time. Try and find a combination of free programs that work until you can obtain something better. I personally use COMODO Firewall Pro and AVG Free 8.0. It's worked so far for me.
 Because they're trying to get you to buy the rest of their product they try and make the piece you have work wonders. This means full updates, customer support, no money needed to have a secure computer, and it's legal. I only posted this because I'm sure others are having trouble finding a security program on TPB that works. Thank you for your time."
