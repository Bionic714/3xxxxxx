,spystyle,2008-08-21T16:46Z,"I tried to ""find"" this game for my daughter and could not on account of ""no seeders"", so I bought it. It was only $15 USD. It's a good value and the game developers are not greedy - had it been more I would have passed, but really, only $15 ? Support these games developers that sell a good value. Unlike the games that are $60 - this one is at a really good price. "
