When I used winrar, one file or so didnt extract, it said it was corrupted (something in the object.pak.) Anyone with the same problem who can help me solve it? (I've tryed reextracting it several times)"

,PR1M3R,2008-01-20T02:38Z,"This torrent DOES work, and very well. I had the problem of nothing happening when I tried to run it. I installed another game, and the vc++ redist. pack that came with it, and now this game runs. My only problem is that after I re-installed windows, and all my other games and drivers, it no longer displays correctly. See my post 2 posts up for details."
,PR1M3R,2008-01-20T02:49Z,Sorry for all the posts. I no longer have any problems with this torrent. Everything is working perfectly. I re-installed my ATI catalyst drivers and everything is perfect. Thanks Vo0!!!

,posadajulian,2008-01-20T22:02Z,"I choose 32 bits, then direct x 9, and then nothing happens, i even tried installing the vc++ thing and it didnt help.

Any ideas??"
,p128sniper,2008-01-22T20:36Z,"This goes to posadajuina and all the other people who have problems with nothing happening after clicking the game in 32-bit. I had the same problem and i tried everything!!! i finally gave up and decided to download the demo, demo played fine and i decided to give this one more try, so i cliked and this time it worked!!! so basically if you want this torrent to work download the demo and you should be able to play. Thats the best i can do."
,p128sniper,2008-01-22T20:38Z,"If you download the demo its only 1.77gig's so its worth downloading demo only and playing this full version if you still have it. so if you have problem like tagih and posadujjian, with nothing happening, download demo and this torrent should work!!"
,p128sniper,2008-01-22T23:30Z,"ok and whats the difference between this game and farcry??? ummmm nothing!!! pretty much same game, still fun though."
,posadajulian,2008-01-23T18:24Z,"kk p128sniper il try that, thx a lot, btw if anyone has any other ideas i would still like to hear them"
,Xjoex93,2008-01-26T23:17Z,Thank you works Great!!!
,posadajulian,2008-01-27T19:55Z,"dude, the demo thing worked to launch the game, but somehow my gpu seemt to be unable to handle the graphics, i have a 7600 gts, i know it is too low for the game but i thought i could at least play it using a low resolution monitor.

The game starts correctly, but graphics make no sense, i mean, gray squares unacurrate shapes and colors, etc etc.

Anyone knows what might be happening??"
,cods,2008-01-29T06:05Z,"Thanks for a great download. Playing single player since you uploaded. Apart from a very occasional freeze, works great in Vista Ultimate 64bit-DX10 with NV8500 graphics."

For the multi player, you will need a gamespy account. It's easy to obtain one. 

However, the problems arrives when you want to join a server and you get some error. 

HOW DO WE FIX THIS?????
