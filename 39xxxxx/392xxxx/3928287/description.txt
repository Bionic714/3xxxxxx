These are some tutorial vids i found at Propellerheads.se. Completely legally. I just figured I would upload them here since some people - like me - have some trouble with the new sequencer found in Reason 4 and might not be as smart - as me - to go check for tutorial videos at their homepage. =)

Anyway, it cant hurt to upload them here too.

Ps. If you want more info about Reason 4 or maybe you would like these tutorials to be in the .mov-format instead, go to: http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/

- Getting Started With Reason 4
- Introduction to the new sequencer
- Recording with the new sequencer
- Editing in the new sequencer
- RPG-8 Arpeggiator overview
- Thor overview
- Regroove overview

Enjoy!



Ps. If anyone have the refill STRINGS i would appreciate if u uploaded it. It exist but the torrent is completely dead.
