├é┬║ FeatureCAM, developed by Delcam, is a suite of CAD/CAM software which 
├é┬║ combines cutting edge technology with ease of use.
├é┬║          
├é┬║ FeatureCAM automates machining and minimizes programming times for 
├é┬║ parts on mills, lathes and wire EDM
├é┬║          
├é┬║ With FeatureCAM, you:
├é┬║ • Draw or import your part
├é┬║ • Identify part components as features (holes, pockets, surface 
├é┬║ milling, etc.)
├é┬║ • Click simulation
├é┬║ • You are done! NC Code is generated!
├é┬║          
├é┬║ FeatureCAM automatically:
├é┬║ • Selects Tools
├é┬║ • Calculates Feeds and Speeds, including Stepovers and Depth of Cut
├é┬║ • Determines Roughing and Finishing Operations
├é┬║ • Generates Toolpaths and NC Code
├é┬║ • You can change any of the automatically selected machining 
├é┬║ suggestions.
├é┬║          
├é┬║ FeatureCAM includes:
├é┬║ • Shared Network Databases for Tools and Feeds and Speeds
├é┬║ • Post Processor Library with 350+ Posts, with the Ability to
├é┬║   Create Custom Posts or Edit Existing Posts
├é┬║ • Feed Rate Optimization
├é┬║ • Application Programming Interface (API) for Macro
├é┬║   Creation and Program Customizations
├é┬║ • Job Quoting Documentation
├é┬║ • Integrated 3D Simulation Package
