,benjirman,2007-12-09T17:35Z,"I also have quite a few of the movie albums that they have songs on, but i believe all of the songs are played at least once somewhere else, that said if anyone wants the movie albums throw a message up there and I'll put a torrent together with them and post the link.  Hope everyone enjoy's.  And I apologize my internet is being retardedly slow so my seeding isn't as fast as i'd like, so if you download this and would be willing to share it even just to ratio of 2 that would make it a lot easier for everyone to get all of this great music.  hope you all enjoy it."
