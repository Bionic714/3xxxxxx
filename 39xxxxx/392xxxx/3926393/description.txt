
The Slavery Business - Breaking the Chains (3/3) BBC2 ~ 2005.08.17 DivX

The third and final part of this series tells the story of how slavery came to an end.

Today William Wilberforce is considered a hero, the man who ended the slave trade, but there's another story that's been hidden for 200 years. Although opposed to the slave trade, Wilberforce believed that the 800,000 slaves owned by the British should remain in chains. He regarded them as unfit for freedom.


This program uncovers the real heroes of the battle against slavery. They were radical political activists, many of them women; fiery evangelical preachers who worked amongst the slaves; and thousands of slaves themselves, who rose up in rebellion to break the chains of their own bondage.
