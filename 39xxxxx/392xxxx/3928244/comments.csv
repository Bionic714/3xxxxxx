,^eRrOR^,2007-12-12T01:52Z,"It's come to my attention that sites I do not use are leeching this torrent (esp warez sites you got to pay to use so they can give you viruses and so on but never the stuff her)
BE AWARE!
I only upload to two sites, the pirate bay dot org AND pirate files.
If you see this torrent on the other sites, it wont work due to a tracker error I had to fix, the non-auth'd sites seem to be using udp:// lol they cant connect to this tracker for just that reason ^_^"

,blt_man,2007-12-19T16:55Z,"If your using a ""good"" copy of hl2 or orange box, will this get them deactivated? (seperate folder or even seperate hd)"
,^eRrOR^,2007-12-20T19:03Z,"sorry about my weird rez messing up things, this is down to my set up having duel screens and me forgetting most people dont have that, so my bad there folks, thanks goes to chase2534 for pointing that out and solving it =)

bltman, only updates via the steam app can bork this up, having orange box installed and my GMod installed somewhere else will ensure that my GMod wonk get wiped out.

I am seeding this for all to get but being xmas and my isp being lazy my up times are mad right now so bare in there, I will continue to seed untill the next update or I'm shown 0 seeds and 0 peers in my torrent client =D"

,^eRrOR^,2007-12-27T22:15Z,"chase 2534, open the torrent in notepad and find udp and change it to http at the begining of the tracker address, I did this so only pirate bay users can use the torrent"

,DonVinco,2007-12-30T11:58Z,Tnx a lot error you're the man . The last thing i need to know is how to make npc move and perform some cool battles. Pls tell me i realy want to know...
,drewdegruyter,2007-12-31T05:20Z,"Ok, I figured out the problem by searching the web. Go to properties, launch options, then advanced, and type in 

-dxlevel 8.0

complete with the dash. then it should run."
,^eRrOR^,2008-01-05T16:56Z,"DonVinco search for NPC Platform for gmod 10, that should do the trick, It's what I use =D"
,_miller_,2008-01-06T17:30Z,are you people so poor that you cant afford ÂŁ5 or $10 for legit version of this game? :S ahh well what can i say lol i rip people off too lol.. but then again the stuff i usually download costs like $2000
,taiiat,2008-01-10T22:03Z,"or maybe theur like me, no access to a credit card, note that gmod is online purchase only?? so i could afford this but have no access. ever think of that??"
,taiiat,2008-01-10T22:08Z,"no post editing.... im gonna seed this too, its slow as hell. im gettin 50k/s. i dl stuff at school faster than that."
,^eRrOR^,2008-01-11T04:26Z,"_miller_ 2000 v 5 0_o LOL

of the 5 you pay to steam only 1 will go to the makers but how ever, IF you like this and want to use the latest updates and addons for gmod then this gives people a try before you buy option.

I would say to people that if you do like this then buy it, I did, but not every one is like me ^_^"
,taiiat,2008-01-14T16:44Z,"woot! the dl speed had tripled. hope i can get this done, zombie survival, her i come!"
,machrtin,2008-01-14T20:07Z,"why does everything have to be .rar and .nfo? oh yes, EVERYTHING is .rar or .nfo, there are fucking WINRAR torrents that end with .rar or .nfo! WTF!"
,taiiat,2008-01-14T22:50Z,"how exactl yis this supposed to work? i cant open the games window in SB. how do i run it? as for  .rar's, theyres great, whats wrong wit em? get 7-zip, free, universal pretty much."
,ShadowScythe,2008-01-15T02:25Z,"1) RAR files are popular because the compression ratio is superior to Zip. 
2) 7Zip is used because its free :p

3) For taiiat 

I had the same problem as you did. After you unpack it where you want, apply the fix from page 1 as follows.

Go into --  [drive_letter]:\[install_path]\

Locate the file called -- sbrev.ini

Right click on it and say Open with Notepad. 

Change the value 
Left=2156   into   Left=280

Then run the application :D
"
,taiiat,2008-01-16T04:14Z,"thnx. im not allowed o run online play. steam verification prob. is it possible i could play online? and i disagree. 7-zip may be free, but thats not the best part. it can open any compression file ive come across so far. "
,taiiat,2008-01-16T04:16Z,hate that i cant edit. i see that i can play on crackead servers. all good now.
,ShadowScythe,2008-01-16T16:05Z,"taiiat --
I never knew that about 7zip... I've always used WinACE for that purpose. 

^eRrOR^ -- 
Wouldn't it be fairly simple to make a fix for the missing textures? Not only that but I bet that Importing things like Portal and TF2 would be at least as easy ;)

Care to discuss?"
,taiiat,2008-01-16T21:15Z,"not neccesarily. file formats have an impact, and having the midels available. and the model's r there, but i think that theyre not working. maybe not all of em, but a lot of em.

and i havent seen any 'cracked' servers. it wouldnt be a prob, cept i wanna play online, and apparently we can only join cracked, but its annoying when there arent any running. "
,rowantwig,2008-01-20T21:33Z,"Does this have the TF2 and Portal models/maps/weapons? If not, why do you bother uploading it? There's allready plenty pre-orange box torrents around..."

[Summary] | [Detailed Description]

Name : 	Backdoor:W32/Hupigon
Alias:	Backdoor.Gpigeon.GEN, BDS/Hupigon.Gen, Backdoor.Graybird, BKDR_HUPIGON.EVG, Mal/GrayBird
Type:	Backdoor
Category:	Malware
Platform:	W32
Origin:	CHINA

Summary
Backdoor:W32/Hupigon is a family of backdoor trojans. It allows a remote user access to the computer.

Back to the Top

Detailed Description
The backdoor's file is a PE executable. It is very rare if the variant is smaller than 299kB. The kit used to make this family of malware has default settings to pack the code as UPX. Unpacked the code size is 710kB. Hupigons are written with Borland Delphi.

When the backdoor's file is started, it copies itself as a file named something similar to ""Hacker.com.cn.exe"" in the Windows System folder and then creates the following startup key value in the Registry:

    * HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\system32
      ImagePath = C:\WINDOWS\Hacker.com.cn.exe


And it creates these keys:

    * HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\system32
    * HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\system32\Security


Overall, Hupigon variants have several different types of features. The following list is an example of some:

    * It allows others to access the computer
    * Allows for recording with the user's webcam
    * Can make the user's computer to attack various servers
    * Send victim's computer messages
    * Has rootkit functionality so it has a stealth component that hides files
    * Create logs from keystrokes, steals passwords, and sends this information to remote servers.


Typically, Hupigon clones itself to some installation path such as system32 and uses the following processes to make itself to look like a valid Windows program:

    * calc.exe
    * cmd.exe
    * mmc.exe
    * mspaint.exe
    * mstsc.exe
    * notepad.exe
    * osk.exe
    * sndrec.exe
    * sndvol32.exe
    * svchost.exe
    * winchat.exe


The kit that creates Hupigon variants has default settings to create mutexes. So many Hupigons have created mutexes which are in the following format:

    * xxx.com.cn_MUTEX

The ""xxx"" being a variable. Example: Hacker.com.cn_MUTEX

The following strings can typically be found in a Hupigon variant:

    * 6600.org
    * BEI_ZHU
    * GrayPigeon
    * Hacker.com.cn.exe
    * huaihuaitudou
    * Rejoice2007
    * woainisisi


Hupigon doesn't have any automatic mechanisms to spread itself, so it must be sent by its author via e-mail, through a website, or even via Instant Messengers (IM) such as Yahoo, MSN, ICQ, and Skype.

Hupigon Kit

As noted above, Hupigon variants are created using a kit. This kit software is maintained in a very professional fashion with a highly developed User Interface (UI)."
