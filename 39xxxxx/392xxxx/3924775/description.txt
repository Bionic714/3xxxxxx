Warrant - Cherry Pie, [Remastered - Expanded]!!!

Finally Here You Get The Chance To Have This Truly Amazing Album

In Losseless Audio! (Flac)

Nothing Much To Add Here, Except That, Once You Play This CD
You Cannot Stop Listening To It!
With Hits Like: "I Saw Red", "Uncle Tom's Cabin" And "Blind Faith" You Assure Yourself A 50 Min. Of Pure Pleasure!!! ;)

Since This Album Is Compressed Into "FLAC" Audio, You'll Need Either:

1. To Decode It Back To .WAVE And Than Use The EAC Program + The .CUE File To Burn It...

Or... 

2. I Also Added 1 Very Cool And Amazing Program To The Torrent Named "Burrrn"
Which Helps You A Lot By No Need Of Further Decoding, Just Drag The .CUE Sheet File
And That's It, You're Ready To Burn!

Just Enjoy, And Plllleeeeasssee... Share! ;)
