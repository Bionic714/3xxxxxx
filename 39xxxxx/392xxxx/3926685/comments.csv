So far I have 2 people downloading, so I know it works. It may be slow going for everyone at first, but at least it's free and in ENGLISH!  

I can't run uTorrent 24/7, but don't give up. I will continue to host this file until it's been downloaded to 500% That means that at least 5 people will have a completed version, so if you download, don't leech. If you don't host until at least 200%, the torrent will probably die."

"
,techiefIve,2007-12-16T19:54Z,"I believe Cantonese, but I'm honestly not sure. The language tracks all said Chinese without specifying and I don't speak either so I couldn't discern between them. There were 3 Chinese audio tracks. The first one (in 5.1) is Cantonese and is not included. The second and third were 2 channel audio so I just took a blind shot at it and hoped for the Mandarin. But knowing my luck, I got the Cantonese. Maybe you could tell us once the download is done."
,usedlikeyou82,2007-12-18T02:31Z,i didnt hear any english. thats for sure.
,techiefIve,2007-12-28T11:03Z,"This movie is in an mkv wrapper. It has multiple languages and subtitles included within it. You need to use either Media Player Classic or VLC Player to make use of the other languages. Both are free and have support for mkv with multiple languages. If you have problems with playback, might I suggest that you check out videohelp.com there is a lot of good information there."
,techiefIve,2007-12-28T11:20Z,"Wow, my mistake. Apparently I uploaded the wrong version in my torrent. It would appear that you are correct that is does not include the English audio.

Again:

THERE IS NO ENGLISH AUDIO IN MY TORRENT. I F*ED UP.

Cantonese and Mandarin are the only audio languages that made it into my torrent somehow. There are however English subtitles. I suppose that I must have uploaded the wrong version of the mkv since I had a few different attempts.

In an effort to fix this, I will be uploading a complete rip of the DVDs including all the menus and the special features. This will be a 2 DVD set and I will post the link here.

My apologies to those that I have disappointed."
,techiefIve,2007-12-28T12:34Z,"Ok, so it turns out that if I simply rip the full DVD to an iso, the volume is screwy. I'll be ripping both discs to mkv but I'll make sure that the languages are correct before uploading. Again, sorry for the bad rip."
,techiefIve,2007-12-30T13:25Z,"Well crap! I figured out why the torrent here is messed up. If I select Chinese1 and English3 audio in my rip, I get Chinese1 and Chinese2 in my final. But if I choose Chinese1 and Chinese2 I get... a corrupt file... FARK! I've even tried to just rip the English audio and build it into the mkv manualy, but the ripped audio is garbled beyond recognition. It looks like no dice for the time being, just enjoy the subtitles for now. The movie was a let down anyway, I suppose it's only fair that the torrent should be too... Not really. I'll keep trying."
,MrCyan,2007-12-31T07:21Z,Thanks for this. And I belive that you should watch it in the original language spoken and english subs. Just looks wrong with dubs.
