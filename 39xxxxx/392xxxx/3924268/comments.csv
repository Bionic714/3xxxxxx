Edit Redneck.cfg for the following;

Set Sound Card for SB-Compatible, Address 220, IRQ 5, Dma 1, High DMA 5

Look near the top for the display mode. change the 1 to a 0. Doing this sets it for ""low res"" mode. Cruddy, but it works.

And then try 'er out! You should get sound AND video working near-perfect on at least a 500mhz system."
