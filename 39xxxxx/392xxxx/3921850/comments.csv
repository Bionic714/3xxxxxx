,wolvy23,2007-12-19T21:27Z,"Hmm havent seen the quality yet, but its sad to see AC3 not yet a standard to implement in your DVDrips. If your going to replace AXXO, he always encoded his rips with AC3 5.1 surround.

,GreenDorkness,2008-01-08T00:24Z,"Terrible movie, and I'm usually very forgiving about these sorts of silly comedies. It tries to be Blades of Glory but fails miserably, relying on a lot of cheap, cheap laughs like being splashed by water and stupid national stereotypes. The only two redeeming points about this movie -- the cool 80s soundtrack and Maggie Q.

Quality is 10/10 though, as you'd expect from FXG."

,junghansmega,2008-03-03T18:35Z,"I would bite my own ass if i would get trouble for downloading  crap like balls of fury.

This shit isn't even remotely funny. Let alone most of the joke-attempts are build around clishees that were already outdated in the early 90s."
,GIbhunter,2008-03-06T05:43Z,"h1m8, im not a douche.. i was just pissed that I got caught off such a crappy movie.  Wouldn't you be pissed to get your warning off this crap?

In the meeting I had to have with someone at my school, he read the title and I started laughing.. I said  ""By the way, Balls of Fury is NOT a porno"""

Plus, only a moron gives a fuck about it, if it was me, I'd delete the files, delete the torrent from my comp, then just to piss them off, start downloading it again from zero percent with my upload limit set to unlimited to spread this to people FAST."

I can't comment on the quality or sound of this download, as I will not be downloading it."

,theRealKarmine,2008-05-29T05:16Z,they can only really bust you for sharing it.  they would have to prove that you weren't tricked by one of the thousands of ways to trick people into downloading shit without them knowing it. PG = trash.  and if copyright infringement is not illegal in canada then why the fuck was canada blocked from isohunt and demonoid because of copyright infringement? retard.
