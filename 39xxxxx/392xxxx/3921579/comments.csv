,da_vide78,2008-06-12T23:57Z,"hi.

has anyone managed to download it fully yet? I've been stuck on 51% for a few days now but checking listening to some of the downloads, they're not complete recordings but snippets of what sound like difference sets.
Is it down to the download not being complete or is it how the tracks actually are?"

,DR_ZAXXON,2008-10-30T14:44Z,"Hello, Sorry for the long delay I am seeding all my sets again , however I will need some good dedicated seeders to help push the songs around.  I have seen some comments / questions regarding the sets.  I would like to re-irradiate that this is my collection I have toted with me and picked up many songs from different sources.  I personally recorded a few but mostly are not my recording.  I have noticed there are a couple of songs duplicated in some of the years.  I guess they re played them at a later date to fill air time.  I do not have a good depth of knowledge regarding to the history and set up and such.  Im just a fan who enjoys the different mixes. (In fact there are many I have not even listened to yet).  So please enjoy and seed.  I m looking for all of 2008 and 2006.  ICQ @ 2144080 if you can help!"
