Thanks for leeching :-)"
,Ozintaos,2007-12-06T16:23Z,My apolgies for slow seed. I am new to torrent creation/seeding and I am working to increase upload speed. The next 2 seasons will post when these are fully seeded. Hang in there guys and Thanks
,grimarn,2007-12-08T12:05Z,"Is this torrent active? After downloading ep 1 nothing happens. 
Please seed... Tnx"
,Ozintaos,2007-12-08T15:15Z,I apologize. My client went down after update last night....I promise to seed until Season 1 and 2 are up. Remaining seasons will come up one at a time and I may split each of the remaining seasons into 2 torrents each. Again I apologize for slow seed and my Noobness but Andromeda will be here complete. From my client stats we are a little over 1/3rd of the way through seasons 1 & 2 Hang in there guys. 
,Ozintaos,2007-12-09T14:36Z,I think I have resolved most of upload speed issues on my end. Spped should be better today. Season 3 will definitely come from one of my more stable computers....I have to restart seed every morning becaus Azureus needs to crashes during the night.
,Ozintaos,2007-12-11T15:35Z,Initial Seeding almost done for season 1. WHen I see another seed or two I will stop seeding season 1 and start season 3. Please help seed this so I can get all 5 seasons up. Season 3 will be fully seeded before season 4 starts
,Ozintaos,2007-12-11T18:24Z,System with torrent data crashed due to winter storm power failure. Seeding will resume when system is restored
,Ozintaos,2007-12-11T23:41Z,S1 seeding back up......need seeders to take over s1 so I can resume s2.  Original system dead but torrents and data files recovered :)
,Lepitius,2007-12-13T06:22Z,"Well, I'm stuck at 88.2% without a seeder in sight."
,r2d2r2d2,2007-12-13T17:03Z,"Atleast 28 person are stuck at 88.6%
Plaese SEED

WE are stuck at Andromeda S2 also..."
,Ozintaos,2007-12-14T02:27Z,Most people are at 89-95% I have watched 3 people hit 100% and then dissapear. Since I lost 1 computer I am forced to seed 1 season at a time until people get the full set and I can move on.
,yellow_snow,2007-12-14T12:33Z,"This is a great torrent - just the episodes and no extra rubbish - perfect.  Just watched ep1 and no problems - good quality.

Thankyou.

Please keep seeding when you can Ozintaos, 'cos it looks like others are not doing so.  I will seed for a month or more when it's all in (for all series) - though my connection ain't all that good either.

Again, thankyou very much for this."
,Ozintaos,2007-12-14T16:30Z,Thanks Yellow_snow. I see several people getting close to 100% on S1 so I will probably start S2 later today. Again sorry all for system crash and please help me seed S1 so I can devote full bandwidth to S2 and the rest of the series. Thanks guys.
,Lepitius,2007-12-14T21:57Z,"It's getting there slowly, but steadily. I'll be sure to seed once I finish downloading."
,Ozintaos,2007-12-14T22:04Z,"Thanks...For some reason, and I cant find the setting, BitTorrent 6.0 wants to seed evenly instead of getting the whole thing out.....keeps giving high bandwidth to guys with lower % downloaded than the guys with 90% and up. Then when it appears that someone does complete they start watching instead of seeding. Btw can you watch episodes without downloading the whole torrent? Thats what I was going for."
,Lepitius,2007-12-14T22:24Z,"Use Azureus, it owns.
Well, you can just put it to download one episode, atleast Azureus has a feature in which you can set priorities, to Normal, High and Do not download to individual files."
,Ozintaos,2007-12-14T22:29Z,Had Azureus on the machine that crashed and Azureus Vuze on another. once I settle in I think it will be my choice. Also still seeing high 90s for completion but then they drop from list and even thogh I have plenty of connections it appears no one completes?
,Lepitius,2007-12-14T22:33Z,"I haven't got a direct connection to a seeder so far, and I'm up to 96.8%. Hardly downloading right now.

Can BitTorrent manually add peers?"
,Ozintaos,2007-12-14T22:36Z,It appears I can manually add peers. I am also adding torrent to another computer so hopefully I can run 2 seeds....if it works I can start season 2 again
,Lepitius,2007-12-14T22:41Z,"If you want another seeder real soon, add 213.35.178.230"
,Ozintaos,2007-12-15T01:43Z,"Ok, double seeding appears to work so S2 coming up for double seed this evenibg"
,Ozintaos,2007-12-15T03:09Z,Ok S1 is fully seeded I will be monitoring S2 for contact. 
,DreamVirus,2008-02-05T00:03Z,What is the Quality of this series? DVDRip i hope?
,Ozintaos,2008-02-21T01:53Z,"Assembled collection of TV rips but well done in my opinion. Created torrent when I was very young to torrents.
