Many thanks "
,mastermind3043,2009-12-16T18:16Z,"To All the Prem Joshua Fans out there...my heartfelt apologies for not seeding this...reason being: I've been two years out of the torrent scene due to my mufuking ISP blocking torrent...you can see that my last post was back in 2007. 

Thanks to all leechers for sticking around all this time. Since i;m on a difffernt machine nw,,i cant seed the same data...but nt to worry...I still hv two PJ albms from my shivamoon days... So i'm seeding these albums >yatri and shivamoon on this torrent:
