AMV Hell rises from the ashes for one final blowout! We thought that AMV Hell 3 couldn't be topped, but we were dead wrong. Well over 1,000 videos were submitted for consideration into this project. We compiled together the best of the best in order to create what will be remembered as the best AMV Project in the history of ever.
