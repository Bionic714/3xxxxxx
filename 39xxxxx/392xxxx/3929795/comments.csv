,montecristo1,2008-03-25T00:34Z,"trabbi is right! The password is ""you!"" This torrent has nice icons and worth getting- do get if you want to customize your icons. And clockerk56 your dumb ass for trying to get people to register their emails at macysfreegift- which is a SCAM, asshole."
,Bookwormbookz,2008-03-29T23:30Z,"I can confirm that the password is ""you!"" (leaving out the "" marks). The rar then unzips fine and the file really is the icons as stated."
,tonedenfine,2008-04-08T00:10Z,"NOTE:

Do not download this torrent. It is password protected and if the password ever really was ""you!"", it no longer is. This will be an absolute and total waste of your time."
,metavoid,2008-04-08T22:05Z,"8 april 2008
Extracted using Izarc with the password ""you!""
Please notice the ""!""
Gave around 2600 xp style (glossy) well designed icons.
Dont sign up at the site mentioned in readme!
Besides trying to scam you, it pretty nice icons. "
,yucko_the_clown,2008-05-09T20:41Z,"Yes, definitely a completely gay, spam-ass move."
,J--P,2008-07-01T17:35Z,"Hey, clockerk56!
You didn't really thought that people would sign up at macysfreegift, did you? 

See what I think about people like you at

,sekaidragon,2008-07-03T07:30Z,"What an asshole... I hate it when people do that, especially when the site is down, so even if you wanted to sacrifice your dignity and run with it, not a chance ... 

Anyhow, metavoid was right, the password is: you!
(including the exclamation mark)

THANKS METAVOID!"
,Master-T2006,2008-08-19T22:06Z,"Password is ""you!""     y o u !      Just 4 Signs"
,Lonepup,2009-02-13T21:55Z,"Password confirmed is:

you!

Nice icons....
No need to get pswrd from website."
,mpilting,2009-11-26T05:07Z,Nice icons. Thnx for this clockerk56. Too bad you got so much hostility from the rest of these dweebs. That's one thing I don't like about the internet - a small percentage of users sorta ruin it for the rest of us. Nice upload.
,apokalypse24,2010-01-07T05:28Z,"PASSWORD: ""you!"" (without quotes)

There is exactly 2685 icons (.png)"
,PhattBouy,2010-08-07T20:17Z,password is you! and the icons are worth the effort - they include a big selection of brighter icons for all your most popular programs. I needed to right click convert to get mine into ico files (from png) for my win xp.
