TurkPipkin on Alex Jones Show


Turk describes how his film Nobelity grew out of 9/11 and the lost opportunity that 
America wasted in harnessing global sympathy as a means for evil rather than good. 
Pipkin also discusses his new book, The Tao of Willie, which is an exploration of 
national icon Willie Nelson's common sense approach to life and how his perspective 
on things brings about spiritual fullfillment and happiness. Turk and Alex discuss 
Willie's presence, character and why he is a great example to us all
