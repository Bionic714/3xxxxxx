,Hei_p책-deg,2008-02-26T11:35Z,"""the role of god in creation"" ??
Why does the put god in some scientific book?

Download ""the god delusion"" from tpb."
,riddleren,2008-04-07T11:11Z,"@ Hei_p?-deg
I think you should give this a try, before you judge Mr Hawking.  He is NOT a religious man, and the part about the role of ""god"" is very intresting.. Way more then Richard Dawkins in the god delution.  Anyway i recomend everyone reading the god delution by Richard Dawkins as well, it is an exelent read. Another genre then this tho..  It's educational science, this book is more just plain science..  Alot Steaphen Hawkings work is Original. As great as Richard Dawkins is, he's work is not as original as this.

Read this..  Read The God Delution and read god is not GREAT.

Thank you"

Wow, I didn't know so many people were closet scientists.

Science > superstition "

,kevinmax101,2008-08-11T13:04Z,"ooops, its a briefer history of time not brief."

,Verkew,2008-11-04T06:48Z,"Downloaded this like 6 months ago and I've listened to it numerous times since then. Love this book, thanks a bunch."
,Mike727,2008-11-26T03:34Z,"@todu:
I think they have an analog version of this file available. This is the digital audio version, and the analog ""words_on_a_page"" file is available at www.amazon.com. Or, if you want a pirated version for free (just like this digital file is free), there are analog buildings that you can actually go to (in person, not on the web), called ""libraries."" You can get the non-digital, non-aural word-book for free there.
The corporations want us to pay money for information....but as real hackers will always get what we want for free!!! 
Tell your friends about these libraries, too. No need to keep them a secret. It's a great way to get word-books for free without the oppresive corporate giants like Barnes and Noble or Borders!

No need to thank me, just pay it forward."
,wizayne,2009-01-10T07:10Z,WOW! great find! i give everyone seeding this props and thanks a ton autoslump! will seed for weeks!

,GGAllinlives,2009-04-11T19:04Z,"lolerskaters, libraries are destroying the beta max companies!!!!!! omg omg they will go out of bussiness.

lol mike ;)"
,blargarg,2009-07-20T08:45Z,"I own this and the original ""A Brief History of Time"".  This edited edition is a bit easier on people who aren't huge into physics/math.  And hey, it's got color pictures for today's youth, rather than the ""bland ol' graphs/charts"" from the earlier edition :)

hei_p-deg, While i am not religious myself, nobody is certain if ""God"" plays a part in anything.  However, until you get your PhD in quantum physics, or any other school of the sort, I would definitely not discount what one of the smartest (scientific) minds of this century puts into his books.  

Do some research into once you get a solid background in physics.  Sure, Schrodinger's Cat gives everyone headaches in school, but ...y'know.  (especially since it was meant as a joke at first).  Anyway, you can look up some of the ideas that Eugene Wigner had as far as the quantum theory went....in that if matter is equal to the total of all possible states (living, dead, existent, nonexistent, etc), and a measurement is taken, what decides what the measurement will be.

Sorry, i don't have the time to go into a huge lecture on Schrodinger's Cat and all that goes with it...but look it up, study it, and you'll see what i'm talking about.  Mr. Wigner and some of his team had the idea that perhaps there IS a ""cosmic consciousness"" that orders everything in the universe.  Whether or not you want to call this ""God"", is up to you.  I highly doubt that if there is a ""CC"" out there, that it ""sent it's one and only son to get impaled on a cross, blah, blah, blah"".  However, who are we to say that there isn't something out there that is all pervasive and whatnot?

Sheesh, look at the top CNN, Fox News, New Scientist, etc articles on whether or not our universe might actually be a hologram (of what, no idea, but google ""universe is hologram"" and it should come up).  

Good read, i plan to listen to it in the car on the way to work :)  Thanks Autoslump!"
,Taku51,2009-08-23T12:07Z,"When I had first read the title of this audio book in the top 100's sections I laughed thinking of Steven Hawking + audio book... 

Anyways downloading now hope it's as good as the description tells"
,Peterc340,2010-01-15T00:02Z,"Thanks!

Also a good read: The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene"
