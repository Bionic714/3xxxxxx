That scam is SOOOO old. Make a fake email that has something along the lines of worldofwarcraft something something support@somewhere.something.

Quick tip to anyone who is dumb enough to fall for this, Blizzard is a company themselves, why would they use yahoo, hotmail, or any 3rd party email service when they have their own? why do they need YOUR account info if you want to get some one elses? simple, some random desperate loser wants your account cuz his SSI only allows him one, so he needs to steal what you paid for yourself. Tomas, lay off the twinkies, get some exercise and lose a few hundred pounds, maybe get a social life if that's possible, don't plague others lives because yours is terrible."
