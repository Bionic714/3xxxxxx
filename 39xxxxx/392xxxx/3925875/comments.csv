I used both Nero, and ConvertXtoDVD, but the audio is 3x faster than the video after converting to a DVD format.
In the main film the audio is done at 00:22:01
In Beyond Batman Beyond audio is done at 04:17
and in the music video it is done at 01:02
Plays fine in all my media player while still in .avi format, but that does not interest me"
