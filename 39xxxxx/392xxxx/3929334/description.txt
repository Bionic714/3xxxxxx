After the murder of Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber); Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) is tangled, once again, into getting the scoop on a third killing spree. This spree revolves around the set of "Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro", and each cast member is getting killed off one by one in the same order they die in the script. With the help of her ex-boyfriend Dewey Riley (David Arquette), who has connections to the cast of Stab 3; Gale and Dewey set out to solve who's doing this and who's next. After each murder, the killer leaves a photograph of Maureen Prescott (Sidney's mother). Could this be clues to the killer's motive, or simply just bait to lure main-target Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) out of hiding? The only keys Dewey, Sidney and Gale have to surviving this third unpredictable killing-spree are: the clues the killer leaves behind, the Stab 3 script, and a video-tape left by old pal Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy).
