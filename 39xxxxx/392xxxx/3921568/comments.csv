,gomzi,2007-12-28T20:23Z,"I usually dont do this but WTF is this, i cant get it to convert to ANY format?

I suggest ppl seeing this to download this movie from elsewhere."
,Creedance,2007-12-30T04:26Z,"Gomzi... just calm down a bit... you probably don't have the right codecs
Get the Ace mega codecs pack you can find it on this site

You will be very happy after that"
,gomzi,2007-12-30T14:33Z,"I'm sorry for my 1st comment, its great to have the uncut version of my fav mov T2. Thanx creedance.

but the trouble is that there is a significant quality loss of i convert it to a XVid/DivX format. Thats not all, i could nt convert it because the movie is corrupt from 00:10:10 - 00:10:13 (hh:mm:ss). So the only option is to split the file in 2 (Start - 00:10:10 = file-1 and 00:10:13 - end = file 2). But the trouble is that the video and sound are not in sync in the 2nd file.
I was able to view the movie in my default/fav MediaPlayer i.e. MP Classic.
But i need a standard format (Xvid), and i encounter 2 problems - loss of quality and out of sync.

I have tried various converters - TVC, Advance X, Biosoft, alok.

Moral of the story, please upload standard formats, like DivX, Xvid, even mpg will do.
BTW some uncut parts are good to see :) thanx"

I'm sorry that you have this problem... it is an old copy in my box. If I could fix the problem I will reseed it and leave you a note on this torrent to let you all know.
Truly, CREEDANCE"

Great quality though the sound was a littlebit off sync.
Anyway i used this codec: http://www.wmplugins.com/ItemDetail.aspx?&codec=H264
with windows media player 11."
