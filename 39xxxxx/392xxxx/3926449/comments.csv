on and now I am dead. That's right this is a message from a genuine ghost. Stick to 'social networking' sites you spacktards who come up with these messages. PS if you have read this message you are already dead, like in the sixth sense or something.
As for the torrent, i'm now going to download it. "
,Vaugloo,2007-12-22T14:45Z,FXG Rock!! Thanks for keeping it real guys & giving us top quality samples (how many of us have spent hours or days downloading- afterwards receiving the password message etc) FXG have set the level (& yes AXXO must have some connection). Check out the I am Legend FXG it is awesome quality!!!!

how dahh fuck is it possible...

seed got damit...."
,kcsx,2008-01-01T19:51Z,It's possible because you're retarded. You obviously don't have whatever bittorrent client you're using configured right.
,Jisp3r,2008-01-01T23:23Z,"hi, kcsx what do you mean by 
""You obviously don't have whatever bittorrent client you're using configured right.""
having it configured correctly will speed up a download?"
,Dolmi0,2008-01-02T20:43Z,Thanks FXG!
,Fileripper,2008-01-02T22:02Z,I am not getting any seeders... what can the problem be? i have everything configured.
,NotThePokerDude,2008-01-04T08:32Z,who has problems with seeders?  with FXG - NO WAY - I use BitTirrent 6.0  - abd I get ANY hot (1000+ seeders) film within 1-3 hours
,NotThePokerDude,2008-01-04T08:38Z,"ALSO if you have ComCAst THAT is probably your problem.

they talk about ""traffic-shaping activities""  LOL fuck com(munist)Cast - 

Google search: comcast bittorrent

and you will see
there are even lawsuits pending against those fuckers

as much as I hate TimeWarner - FAST torrent downloads (1000+seeders=1-3 hours average)"
,napotus`,2008-01-05T16:10Z,awesome rip guys :) keep up good work :)
,Tobbator,2008-01-05T19:28Z,"For all you format freaks. Buy yourself a TVIX and dont ever think of CDs or DVDs or format compatible anymore. Just plug it in to your TV and watch DVD and HD quality movies that you download from PirateBay:

(You can probably get this from your local shop, ex www.komplett.se, www.komplett.no, etc..)"

,Rav3rPills,2008-01-24T03:44Z,"LOL. For those of you who are having trouble streaming this to your PS3, I have found a solution:

Buy a fucking 360. No, I'm not into ""console wars"" but this is the truth. Sell your PS3 to some 12 year old on eBay and buy a 360. I had a PS3 first... MY GOD WHAT A WASTE! Got my 360 six months back...GLORIOUS"

,locdasmoke,2008-03-03T22:35Z,"I thought this movie was all right, a little bit too much like Land Of The Dead a though at times... 

FTW2000:
Hitman is a great movie done after a video game, and so is AVP, Silent Hill and a few others, but yeah alot of video game movies are just hella wack... Comic movies though, they usually turn out good, except Spiderman 3 they totally fucked up the original story for it and killed Venom and in the comics Venom is suppose to live and have his own comic a few years after he was introduced in Spiderman"

,Nilias2,2008-03-30T21:20Z,The sound is all fuck up! Any on else have the same problem?
,FloatingBrick,2008-03-31T21:04Z,V for vendetta is also a good example that you CAN make good movies out of comics
,T3MUL3NT,2008-04-05T03:23Z,"Movies out of comics generally go good, because you have an outline to follow(Sin City, if anyone read those comics they'd know that the movie almost matches the comic's in visuals and dialoge).

But as a general rule, video game movies suck. Resident Evil one and Apocalypse were mediocre, and this one wasn't much better. But its worth a watch.  

Also Riddick the movie wasn't based on that crappy game it was based on the movie Pitch Black, which was the first Riddick movie(which is good, see it)."
,Hancok,2008-04-10T23:25Z,"28 days later and 28 weeks later is more like the resedent evil games then this movie. hell, I am legend is as well XD"
