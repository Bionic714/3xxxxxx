John Dahlback - Nothing Is For Real (Mark Knight Remix 2005) [Electro House]


I am not going to make a habit of posting back-dated tracks, but there will be occasional important exceptions as we go along; and certainly this post is the first such case in my reconstructed release schedule.

Today's stint of posts are focussed around the extremely talented craft of Mark Knight, and I thought it prudent to begin with a collector's absolute essential.

Reading both the names "John Dahlback" and "Mark Knight" in the same sentence can only mean pure quality.

If you aren't familiar with either artist, I am extremely confident your curiosity will be rewarded with a much enhanced definition of cutting-edge electro.  This production may have been released in November of 2005, but it is still standing extremely strong in the current climate of varying styles of electro.

There is simply nothing that needs saying for those in the know.


Please stay tuned for today's fine selection of Mark Knight remixes and productions.



Enjoy and please seed.
