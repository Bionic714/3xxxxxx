,tontiploster,2008-05-27T00:17Z,"i have a question for all those saying these videos are high quality:
are you fucking blind?

these are 384*288 (small) encodes with blended fields, resulting in sickening jerky motion and with lots of encoding artifacts (trailing blocking etc)

DONT DOWNLOAD THIS CRAP!!!!!!!!!"
,JamesBolivardiGriz,2008-05-30T10:39Z,"I think tontiploster works for Fox Network who are pissed noboby is buying the DVD's 8 people reckon the quality is great including me.

You decide between some wanker who is too technical for his own good or the hordes of torrent users who have downloaded this and think its fine"
