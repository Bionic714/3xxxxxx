,mrhex,2007-12-06T16:22Z,"Virus, Trojan phishing warning!!!

U DO NOT NEED ANY EXE FILES FOR THIS!!!

U suggest people look for ETH0 releases like, Windows.Genuine.Advantage.Validation.v1.7.59.1.CRACKED-ETH0 this oe looks extremely suspicious."
,kent-ru,2007-12-06T21:28Z,"richard: You need to open the wga.reg file with regedit.exe

mrhex: I can understand your concerns, but it's not a virus. I give you my word, but it's up to you.

,alejoo123,2007-12-08T17:02Z,it works for me....but i have to do it everytime i restart my computer...can someone help me so i dont have to do it everytime?
,DonbertK,2007-12-08T17:12Z,"I'm running XP Pro (the Japanese version, but I doubt that would mke a difference), and I got the same problem d-29er. To solve it, I logged in in safe mode and did a system restore. No reinstall was necessary.

So overall this didn't work for me. "
,Thn_ragger,2007-12-09T00:54Z,Damn it dossent work for me its still asking me if i wanna bye the shit.. :P
,kent-ru,2007-12-10T05:54Z,"I found that I had to reinstall WGA.reg after a reboot myself. 

The simplest solution is to reinstall WGA.reg only when you check for updates, else you don't need it.

When your running Windows update, it will ask you to install an update called: ""Windows Genuine Advantage Notification (KB905474)"". This is the update that messages you when Windows is not genuine (I also think it connects to a MS database to check). DON'T install this!!"
,tikitak,2007-12-11T03:14Z,"What you should do:

Go to Windows Update and let it install the latest Windows Genuine Advantage tool thingy.

Then run the registry edit included in this torrent.

Worked perfectly for me. "

,Bone4Ever,2008-02-07T17:14Z,I doubled clicked on the WGA.reg but i just came up with notepad .. and a lots of nubmers..? Plz help!
,kent-ru,2008-02-11T01:26Z,"Bone4Ever: You have associated .reg files with notepad for some reason. You can run regedit from ""start"" > ""run"". Choose ""file"" > ""import"". Browse to the file, then open it. Easy, just tell me if u bump into problems :)"
