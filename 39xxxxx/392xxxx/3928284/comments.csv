,MaximilianSeptillion,2007-12-10T02:21Z,Almost SIX HUNDRED MEGS for 20 songs?  I think you messed up.
,lobsterman72,2007-12-10T02:44Z,No its High quality.. It hasnt been compressed. The audio isn't crummy sounding like a 5meg mp3. Some people rember before mp3's and how the audio quality was very good. Mp3's now are digitally compressed and sound kinda crappy.
,lobsterman72,2007-12-10T02:48Z,"If you do download this also try to grab another copy thats 5meg or whetever of one of the songs.. You'll notice the difference. (maybe you need headphones or a good stereo system to notice). And please seed if you enjoy it, I am sorry if its slow but I am trying to contribute."

,blue_star,2010-02-18T12:00Z,"Lobsterman, I do not understand how come just 20 songs be off 572.39 MB, even if these are high quality songs."
,2ROND2,2010-12-01T05:27Z,@blue_star - I presume that the tracks are encoded in WAV format and such take up 572.39 MBs (which is standard for the WAV format). Yes MP3 files etc are much much smaller but they are also pretty rubbish in terms of Sound Quality.
