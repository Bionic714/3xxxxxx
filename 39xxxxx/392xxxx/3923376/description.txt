F.A.Q (Ex-Carpe Diem) Bandinfo 

The band was founded by Philip Noirjean and Dino Zizzari in 1994 by the name Carpe Diem. Their music is characterized by outstanding rhythms and melodies with a catchy tune. Several concerts in Switzerland brought Carpe Diem a lot of positive feedback. Already in 1996 their first album Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½SubstituteÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ was released, which gives an impression about the first years of the band playing together. Evidently, Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Back to the SourceÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ was the highlight of the album; the song with a great hit-potential became immediately darling of the public. It was followed by numerous enquiries to play in Switzerland as well as abroad. In the end of 1996, the band was expanded by Mary Santella on the violin, keyboard and as a background singer. With her violin playing she bestow Carpe Diem with a new touch. Together, they gave birth to new songs in an intensive time of working in the studio. This was not an excuse to avoid to go on stage indeed. In the meantime Carpe Diem were an newcomer insider-tip in Southern Germany. I

n 1999, the 12Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½The SaintÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ was released, played in various clubs and became a guarantor for a full dance floor. In November they supported the band Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Deine LakaienÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ on the Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½KasmodiahÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½-tour for 4 days. All concerts were a great success and the first album Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½SubstituteÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ went out of stock. 

The final break through: In February 2000, Carpe Diem supported Apoptygma Berzek on their Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Welcome to EarthÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½-tour through Europe. Carpe Diem coddled their audience with songs, which were released by Synthetic Product Records in October 2000 on the album Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Self-fulfilling ProphecyÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½. Carpe DiemÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â´s last stroke happened on the MÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â´era Luna Festival 2002 when, at the end of the concert, Philip Noirjean sang the song Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Endlose TrÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â¤umeÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ with De/Vision-singer Steffen. 

However, in spring 2003 the electro formation from Switzerland gives a double comeback: Besides the new long player Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Carpe DiemÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½, the band has changed its name to F.A.Q. After a long break and legal dispute on their name - which on one hand caused mistake in name and on the other hand bore a unsettled legal position - the band is now back on stage and ready for the frequently asked questions (F.A.Q). To establish the link to the previous time, their new album is called Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Carpe DiemÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½. The band has taken the chance to pursue a new musical track. 

Although F.A.Q has not dissociated with their typical sound, apparently there are new approaches.   Not only has Philip NoirjeanÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â´s voice become Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½brighterÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½, but also their music style now dares to touch the Pop-genre and to check the given musical variety. While their last album Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Self-fulfilling ProphecyÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ was mainly influenced by synth and wave, the new Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Carpe DiemÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ appears to be a lot fresher, more open and versatile. As we are convinced by songs like Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Bones of GlassÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ or Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½HomeÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½, the band never denies its origin. Meanwhile titles as Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½SkyeÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ and Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Year OneÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ show us where the band is heading to in the future and by that makes room for new influences. Who ever believed that Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Deine LakaienÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ and Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½MobyÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ have nothing in common, will think different after listening to Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Carpe DiemÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½. 

F.A.Q invites the audience to be open-minded and to live after the saying Ã?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Carpe DiemÃ?Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½! This is a requirement this album brings along. By the way: Artwork and pictures must be named extra. In a professional shooting, Phil, Mary and Dino were dumped with colours and a high-speed camera took the pictures, which were lovingly edited in leporello. Finally, the half-transparent CD tops the artwork off. As a support from De/Vision, F.A.Q presents their latest work to Germany. Yet, the band only performs as a duo. Dino Zizzari has left F.A.Q shortly before the tour started to strike a new musical path. Nevertheless, Philip Noirjean and Mary Santella are successful, Phil with his guitar inputs which remind a lot of PlaceboÃ?ï¿½Ã?Â´s Brian Molko, and Mary with added vocal parts on which the audience reacts positively. After the tour, Phil and Mary decide to enlarge the band with a new member. Pille joins them as a guitar player. At the moment, F.A.Q works on a expanded live-set for the next concerts which are planed to take place in fall 2003. Lets be surprised!   Philip Noirjean:vocals, Fender VI Mary Santella:vocals, violin, keyboard Pille:e-guitar, acoustic guitar
