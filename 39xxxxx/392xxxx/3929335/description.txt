What is Holiday for Heroes?
It is this : 



In homes across America, there will be an empty chair this holiday season.  The man or woman usually sitting in that chair is in the military, serving overseas.  There is no family Christmas or Chanukah for those brave soldiers.  The Soldiers' Angels family wants every deployed hero to know they are remembered and appreciated during the holidays.

Please help Soldiers' Angels deliver a gift and personal holiday message into the hands of all the deployed men or women this December. We are committed to providing Holiday Gift Bags for every soldier, Marine, airman and sailor deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as those working or recuperating in a Combat Support Hospital. That's around 140,000 gifts to purchase, assemble, and ship around the world. This is a big challenge but with your support and our wonderful group of hard-working volunteers, it's possible. Each Christmas gift bag contains either a Soldiers' Angels stainless steel mug or a Christmas stocking, with white socks, a 150 minute International Pre-Paid phone card, hot cocoa mix, hot cider mix, power bar, Christmas candy, and a hand-written Christmas card. The cost is $10 per mug or stocking, or $25 with goodies and overseas shipping included. For our Jewish soldiers, we will also be sending Chanukah gifts, kosher goodies and hand-written Chanukah cards.

Can you sponsor one or a few? Can you send a Christmas or Chanukah card with a personal message of support and holiday wishes? Can you donate requested items to include in Holiday for Heroes Gift Bags?
