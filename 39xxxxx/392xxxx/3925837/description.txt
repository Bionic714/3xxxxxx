It must be said that this little rooster has been praised by all the Great gender, Mariah Carey to R. Kelly via Kanye West and Jamie Foxx. It's March 9, 2006, at the Soul Train Music Awards, he received the best revelation of the year.

With its air of infant and her little boy voice, it must be said that Chris Brown brings a certain innocence in a musical universe often decried for its violence and its machismo. No silicone dolls in his clips, it just reciting a few pages of his diary, fear, the joys and failures of his first time adolescents.

A little cramped in a family of 15 children, Chris Brown decided to follow Jive Records in late 2004. Although it took, barely a year later, he signed his first eponymous album, which are extracted the famous single Run It!, Yo, Gimme That and "Say Goodbye"
