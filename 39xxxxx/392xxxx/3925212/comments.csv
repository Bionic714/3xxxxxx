Two days waiting and not one bit downloaded. Thsi is probably a joke, or maybe the guy has died in front of his computer. Whatever the explanation is, my advice: forget about this torrent, buy the dvd instead. If you have a lifetime to waste, then you probably can DL this and get it done by the time you're retired. If not, well...a big Hurrah for this years WORST SEEDER!!!"

@ralphparot: please seed - I can't get this any other way where I am :)

Thx!"
,ralphparot,2007-12-24T02:11Z,"Apologies, but had problems with my PC.  A little patience would have been nice there badlands.  Next time I suggest you buy the DVD."
,lucite2,2007-12-27T09:37Z,"@ralphparot - thanks for seeding! :)

Right now I'm stuck at 67% but since you're currently the only seeded, that's not surprising. In any event, please keep seeding until there are a few of us out there who can help seeding with you.

Cheers "

,throwing_wheel,2011-08-22T02:16Z,"Please seed.  Is no one interested in this fine, subtle, thoughtful work?  I saw this years ago and now, with Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy having been remade and soon to be released, I want to see this again.

It was a pleasure re-watching the original TTSP.  I hope the new one is equally good.  How can it be, though, since it must have been rendered with substantial condensation and elimination of detail.

In any case, please seed."
