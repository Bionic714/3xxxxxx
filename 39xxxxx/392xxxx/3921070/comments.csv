http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3920851/Ableton.Live.v7.0.1-AiR.rar

But double the size, since you unpacked it as well.."
,jokeri1971,2007-12-07T03:52Z,mine is not from AIR its cracked and ready for use
,RootOut,2007-12-07T20:08Z,"/air.nfo	12.38 KiB
/air_Live_7.0.1.rar	69.66 MiB
/setup.exe	69.66 MiB

Not from AIR? 
thx anyway"
,deluxeredux,2007-12-08T04:36Z,"If this is from Air and it doesn't work than that would explain why everyone is stuck at 83.5%. 

Thanks anyway though."
,shredthegoof,2007-12-08T08:40Z,"This does not  work. It installs ,but after a few mins ( if that) it discovers itself and rats you out.  The AIR 6.0.7 is still the best one."
,king_david,2007-12-10T07:07Z,"still stuck at %83 i opened up the files (without the rar) and down loaded it...it seems to work ...i have to keep using it and see what happens....(all the preferences say ""unlocked"")"
,king_david,2007-12-10T15:33Z,"Mon Dec 10th 2007 9:28AM
turned it on (the Ableton live 7.0.1)
its still working as of this time had no issuses
since the rar and the setup.exe file are the same size i guess its the same version but its zipped(or ""rar-ed"")
i have ableton 5...6..and now 7
7 seems to be fuller more robust...will keep working with it  ..see how it turns out
wish joker would seed  . . . . . ."
,caynick,2007-12-11T10:33Z,"does this have the extra instrument packs included or is it too small?

""Essential Instrument Collection 2
The boxed version of Ableton Live 7 includes the Essential Instrument Collection 2, a multi-gigabyte library of meticulously sampled instruments providing a choice selection of acoustic and electric pianos, guitars, bass, drums, orchestral strings, brass, woodwinds and more."""
,RootOut,2007-12-12T02:43Z,still 83.5% and no seeders
,NYCRocker,2008-01-11T22:22Z,  Yo! Antone know why I don't have the library? It opens fine but I have no sounds. Whazzzup? Thanks.
,Master_British,2008-01-12T14:47Z,you can find instrumental plugin packs at http://www.anonym.to/?http://www.ableton.com/latest_versions for free

,NYCRocker,2008-01-24T09:59Z," I don't have any decent guitar sounds,crash cymbals or hi-hats. I don't think this is or any of these small Ableton 7 torrents are the full library versions. Anyone know where I can get the full Ableton Live program? All of it?"
,theris,2008-01-29T16:01Z,"bring your own sound, that's how your own music is written."
,theris,2008-01-29T20:41Z,"hm. works.. works.. works.. god damn. still works. like waiting for a death sentence. works.. i earn some money outta it, i'm buying this shit"
,NYCRocker,2008-01-30T11:09Z,Gotta problem. Yes this download installs and works great BUT it doesn't seem to have a preferences file. I jacked up the VST scan and now it's searching my entire drive for VSTs on loadup and crashing. A simple fix for this is go in and erase preferences.cfg but there is no such file with this crack. Uninstalling and deleting everything Ableton and reinstalling is no help. I have to find a way to delete the preferences or reformat my drive. Anybody know what to do? Thanks.
,caynick,2008-03-28T22:08Z,thanks! works great - anyone know where the Mac version is?
,geefunkt,2008-06-24T04:41Z,cunt
,tempest666,2008-08-15T17:55Z,"has any seen a trojan?

,Anticlown,2008-10-02T21:22Z,"downloading it now. :D

i'll get back to you to tell if you if it has or hasnt worked."
,Anticlown,2008-10-02T22:10Z,"the application seems to be working fine - but apparently it is in Demo mode, and i need a serial number to get out of Demo mode - i thought this would have been included in the download? =/"
,JonathanBG,2008-10-22T04:11Z,Mine is stuck at 83.4% as well  :- (
