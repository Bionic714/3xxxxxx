,ttmin,2007-12-12T14:29Z,"To all you youngsters seeking guidance in your life.
This political doctrine has been tested in a full scale experiment in Germany. Today is best known as Nazism, and it didn?t stand its final test and ended with the World War 2. 
So I would be looking elsewhere for important political impulses. The most recommended method is to use your own head, THINK."

Wow.  Somebody really missed the point of learning about history.

Great upload, seeding for 2 weeks or 500%."
,icebox1701,2007-12-19T14:29Z,"hmmm,

history teaches us ONE thing: nobody learns from the history :)

If we do not study the errors in the past we are bound to repeat them...

So I suspect that knowing is better than ignoring..."
,duhprane,2008-01-04T04:12Z,the past is prologue
,VenomOfRivia,2008-03-27T14:18Z,"history is really nice but there lay to many lies.
and it teaches us many things"
,deni1985,2008-07-13T06:07Z,"Well, I'm trying to figure our the relationship between hitler's ""New World Order"" and Mr.Bush's ""New World Order"". If they are the same, shouldn't I read this book so I know what to look out for?"
,pirat8l79,2008-07-21T00:39Z,"Hitlers NWO?? Hitler fought the internationalists (in that time there still were no globalists).
He prohibited secret societies. With him germany became a powerful nation. That's the reason why the world power, the British Empire looked for a pretext to declare war on Germany. It's them who could once again afford it to drop millions blacks and Indians from their colonies into the battlefields. The internationalists defeated Hitler and built up the new world order. The NWO is what we have today. The rule of private global corporations who are also creating political structures for a world government."

Hitler had the right idea. The only mistakes he made were trusting the Russians and the Japanese."
,Fromage25,2009-02-25T09:46Z,Nice quality
,occollegeboi420,2009-04-24T06:52Z,Is this BOTH volumes or just the first? Thanks. 
,occollegeboi420,2009-04-24T06:54Z,"Nevermind, this is BOTH volumes.  Just what I was looking for. Thanks."
,cell86,2009-04-30T05:13Z,"It´s a book Hitler started writing while imprisoned after a failed Coup in 1923, Munich. Mainly an autobiography and an exposition on Hitler´s ideology. Good read and whoever says ""don´t read this"" is a moron. Study the past, learn from it, apply it. At least that´s the whole idea of studying the past, right?"
,Danzx6r,2009-12-13T00:15Z,Downloaded in 33 seconds! Thanks ;o)
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-12-31T22:42Z,"Wow, everyone who is trying to sound smart and political, shut the fuck up.

You're all saying ""OMG NAZIS ARE BAD"" and ""Fascism isn't right"", well if you're so democratic than you're a fucking hypocrite for trying to silence it and telling people they're dumb for believing something different.

Fucking download it and shut up, if you're not downloading it, stop coming to this page, and shut up anyways. You keyboard commanders that ruin downloads are fucking annoying..."
,slipper92,2010-02-21T18:04Z,"I just admire his ideas,

I know it sounds awfull, but heck I admire anybody who i want"
,Sven the swede,2010-10-06T20:18Z,"I think today this book is more important than ever. For further reading I can recommend the following books:

The International Jew 
Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion 

It is very important that people with good intentions are educated about international Jewry."
,alexross8,2010-10-08T17:27Z,"I love this. I am a nationalist , and I don't support what Hitler did.
But this is a good torrent.
Just the few chapters have opened my eyes to how nice Hitler seemed.
Those stupid Russians. If they hadn't put Hitler into that closed-in situation , Hitler would have kept the Jews in the concentration camps and give them to another country rather than have them gassed ."
,kreem,2010-10-17T18:15Z,This is NOT in the ebook format - it is a PDF file.  To projectmimic - try naming your torrents correctly
,Doowangle,2011-01-28T02:21Z,"The nazi party could have worked if it had a better leader than Hitler. Fascism transformed Germany from a economically depressed, war devastated nation, into an industrial powerhouse. They had the best scientific minds in the world (many of them jews) and they were far ahead in many areas under fascism. It all went wrong when Hitler started getting aggressive. I understand how essential it was to his long term plans, but a smarter leader might have avoided this. 

A good read is a alternative history book called 'making history' by Stephen Fry. The plot of it has a Cambridge scientist discovering a way to send a small object through radio like waves back in time to the drinking well of hitlers would-be father 8 weeks before he was to be conceived. Instead a far wiser, sneakier, but more brutal leader comes into power, and germany wins the war, with atrocities that would make hitler squirm. Highly recommended.   "
,apokalypse24,2011-08-22T16:44Z,"Hitler is the God of War !

Jews should indeed be purged from the earth ! They are so dumb and useless."
,kian89,2011-08-27T11:19Z,Long live the man.
,TheDeadNextDoor,2011-09-09T02:32Z,"All senseless debating aside, thank you ProjectMimic. "
,megatron333,2011-09-21T22:26Z,"pirat8l79 think and learn truth before speaking or touching the subject!!!!! and learn from your erroneous comments. 
Thanks."
,Gmooba,2012-01-08T08:18Z,"kreem: How is PDF not an 'ebook format'? What do you think 'ebook' format is? e-book stands for ""Electronic Book"" - so ANY format that can be read using an electronic system like a computer, is in fact ""ebook format"". But I am curious about your suggestion, what are the 'ebook formats' in your opinion?"
,nodom,2012-05-29T22:00Z,"thanks brother :)
i am writing a novel in which a character is going to be based on Hitler...it will be good to get in his head a bit

peace and love:)"
,Vulcade,2012-07-11T01:27Z,Which translation is this?
