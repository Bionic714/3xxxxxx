,delightindisorder,2008-03-16T01:46Z,"Great torrent, update worked perfectly.  No problems."
,budser,2008-03-17T00:00Z,"WARNING:  Turbotax requires you to pay an additional $35.90 to e-file your federal and state returns.  RIPOFF.  Fortunately, it gives you the option of printing your return (to mail it in) for free."
,suspicionx21,2008-04-06T07:40Z,"I just noticed another torrent of tax software had a comment that said the Direct Deposit account # had been pre-filled in, which would be rather dangerous for anyone with a less noticing eye. 
Just a heads up without any direspect to the original uploader. Thanks and cheers."
,kron4me,2008-04-07T17:39Z,This torrent is bullshit! you have to sign up for spam  and still get nothing DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!
,WolfeWoman,2008-04-08T00:28Z,Dont know what kron4me's problem is but this is working perfectly for me.  Needed 14 updates (as expected) and .net had to be updated as well and the MS update to .net.  Thanks!
,Tomm8888,2008-04-19T19:26Z,You guys fucking rock. I saved 89 bucks and it works like a dream. Thanks. I only hope I dont owe again this year. Fuck H&R Block heads. 
,soccerdad,2008-08-12T21:42Z,Anyone have old versions of TurboTax Premier?  Specifically for tax year 2002.  
,darxide23,2008-09-24T00:35Z,"Here's a friendly tip for everyone filing taxes.. NEVER go to one of those ""Instant Tax Refund"" places. I did it and they ran my name against a collections database and ended up giving my entire $3300 return over to an old loan that I had 9 years ago. Fuck HSBC."
,luis1027,2008-10-27T18:52Z,DOES ANY1 KNOW IF THIS WORKS
,carlosbx7,2009-01-05T13:01Z,Just print the final form and take it to your local IRS office. They'll file for you electronically for free!!!
,carlosbx7,2009-01-17T09:00Z,"Actually, if it is from previous years, IRS will process it the old fashion way, not electronically, or so they told me at a NY City office."
