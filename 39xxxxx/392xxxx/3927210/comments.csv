[T],z247,2007-12-09T09:37Z,I am sorry but it is something wrong with the tracker. I see several people trying to download the movie but nothing is going on. I will wait 3-4 hours and if nothing will change I will make another torrent.
[T],z247,2007-12-09T16:55Z,"OK, I am seeding. I do not know what happened but the tracker seemed to be dead for several hours (or so it seemed).
I see almost 20 users downloading the film so it should run flawlessly. 

PS I am superseeding so I may be not visible for everybody. "
