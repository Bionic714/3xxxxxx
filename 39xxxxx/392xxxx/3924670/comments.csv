,epithelial,2009-01-25T16:39Z,"What ruined this collection for me was that a lot of the design books were not scanned at all, but badly photographed. Thank you for the good scans, but I do wish future collections are curated better. 

Of the design books, only 5 out of 13 files are okay.  The rest - meh.

[ok] (Rockport) Letterhead & Logo Design 4.pdf 
[ok] Design For Web Developers - Colour And Layout For The Artistically Overwhelmed (Dmxzone-2005).pdf
[photographed] Don't Make Me Think - A Common Sense Approach To Web Usability (By Steve Krug - New Riders, 2000).pdf
