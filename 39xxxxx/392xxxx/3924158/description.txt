Using a pastiche of composed, sampled and recorded instrumentation, Newfoundland's Errand Boy creates an ensemble of 13 tracks that defies the cliches of IDM and genrefication of laptop-driven music as a whole, as it draws influence and samples from everything from math rock to jewish folk music and childrens records, and leaves the listener with a varied collection of tuneful, emotional and always accessible songs which have been called "lo-fi sample-driven nerd-fok."

Errand Boy's first official full-length release has been compared to post-rock staples such as Do Make Say Think, Mum, and Canadian rock saviors Broken Social Scene, but filtered through an electronic lens, creating an autobiographical music diary that's melancholy but inviting, and consistently refreshing.
