,Bossman69,2007-12-09T02:49Z,"It's taking a while, but I am really looking forward to it, thanks m8."
,thegregger11,2007-12-09T22:03Z,how can you have a complete season 2 when it hasn't even aired the last two episodes? 
,Gantros,2007-12-10T03:24Z,Supposedly the last two episodes were leaked
,flagg12092,2007-12-10T04:31Z,"Yep - the final two episodes were leaked, the ending is very well written. Enjoy (once you have it...)"
,andreee69,2007-12-11T15:55Z,sub???
,Aeza,2007-12-11T20:47Z,when i downloaded this i could only get the sound to play with no picture. does anyone else have this prob or know how to fix this?
,flagg12092,2007-12-15T08:28Z,"@ Aeza - you need to make sure you have the latest XviD codec installed: www.xvid.org

Also, use the VLC Media Player - it handles everything and is less buggy than MS Media Player: www.videolan.org"
,thomastptp,2008-04-28T16:40Z,guys you have to seed!! don't be so selfish!! do not stop seeding after you have got the season;)

,chinuplittledragon,2008-08-21T00:05Z,i just finished downloading this torrent and might have messed up when attempting to open the entire file with imovie but i can now only find only the last 4 episodes... any suggestions? or was this really only episodes 9 through 12?

,0xotox0,2009-02-21T02:34Z,[color=red]Thanks[/color]
,0xotox0,2009-02-21T02:56Z,"Thanks !
Now : 50 seeders (10 real seeds, it's fast !) it means that 40 seeders aren't connectible (bad port configuration or disconnected).
PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT SEEDS READ THIS :
In your bittorrent client :
1/ Activate DHT support
2/Activate ""client exchange""
3/Activate ""DHT for new torrents""
4/Uncheck ""random port at startup""
5/Use port N째 between 50000 and 60000 (dynamic port range)
6/Open the port in your firewall and router (if you have 1)
7/Allow bittorrent connexions in your firewall (in program control)
8/ Don't move the file you're downloading while you're downloading it ! (It will stop the DL process) Same thing if you want to seed (and you SHOULD seed for at least 24h, doesn't have to be 24h straight)
That's all, if you've done all that it should work fine."
,SanzeeBoy,2009-07-19T07:17Z,"Gracias Senorita! 

Just kidding. Could you imagine if I talked like that?"
,dlldmn,2009-10-29T01:21Z,"I dunno if this happened to any one else, but when I got to episode 7, about 3/4 way through it stopped and said ""data type is not supported"".. Dunno.. other than that, it's all quality/works fine.. That's probably my own computer error anyway..
Thanks mate."
,manteltje,2009-12-11T23:13Z,"I'm sorry, I do not understand how to seed? otherwise I would!!! :-("
,drewdrop,2009-12-15T08:19Z,"Fell off Dex's boat a few years back so I'm looking forward to catching up! Thanks a lot and I'll be seeding at least 1.5. Very good quality, thanks again."
,drewdrop,2009-12-15T08:29Z,"ps. I'd love to lick Lila from head to toe. Jaime, you sexy fuckin beast!"

,MrEvolution,2010-03-14T21:45Z,Thx man.Love Dexter.
,MaXiMiUS,2010-05-02T01:07Z,"@flagg12092

VLC uses it's own decoders, telling people to download random codecs and then use a program that doesn't utilize said codecs is kind of stupid.

Thanks for the upload, regardless :)"
,user1238,2010-06-18T10:04Z,"If your bandwidth is limited or expensive then skip 2x06 - Dex, Lies & Videotape.avi
This 1 is crude, the characters' behavior is ugly, and stylistically it does not fit in the series."
,3ss0neR,2010-09-09T03:58Z,"Man this is bs ... I've been stuck DLing at 25-30k and ULing at 10-150!!!  Seed, people ... You liked getting it, now share it!!"
