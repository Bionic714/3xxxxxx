Episode 17: LEGACIES
Are the Minbari pounding the drums of war? Their planet-to-planet memorial 
tour honouring a fallen combat hero raises suspicions aboard the freeport 
dedicated to peace. It also raises Delenn's ire, leading her to take a stand 
against her homeland's warrior caste. 

Episode 18: A VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS (part 1) 
It's barren and uninhabited. That's what station members think - until they 
finally explore the strange planet nearest them..... and find it's a threat 
to their survival. 

Episode 19: A VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS (part 2)
Incredible cybermachines found on Epsilon 3 spark a fierce tug-of-war to claim 
the highly advanced technology. But there may be a better way to settle the 
dispute: make sure no one can lay hand, claw or tentacle on the revolutionary 
machinery! 

Episode 20: BABYLON SQUARED
Before B5 there was B4. The long-lost station mysteriously reappears, 
triggering a desperate scramble to rescue B4's crew before the craft slips 
again into time. There's another revelation: the astonishing identity of the 
galactic spiritual leader called The One!
