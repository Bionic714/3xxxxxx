A few words about Sashti

Sashti is the day Lord Subramanya defeated the demon Soorapadman and saved
the Earth. When the Devas couldn't tolerate the evildoings of this demon they approached the son of Lord Shiva and Parvati. The kind Lord went on a war against Soorapadman. The war was waged for six days, at the end of which the Lord vanquished the asura. He threw his weapon at him and Soorapadman was split into two halves. One half became a peacock, which Muruga took as His vehicle. The other became a cock and was transformed into his flag.
