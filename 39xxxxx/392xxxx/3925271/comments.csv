,jmrt,2008-01-02T06:50Z,Experiencing some minor issues with the serial:S
,yeoldecaptain,2008-01-06T03:14Z,"The aircraft installs and loads great.  I also installed the service pack available for her.  However I am running FSX SP2 with Acceleration and for some reason the windows in the 777 apear as solid.  I can't locate their files anywhere to correct the Alphas myself (they kept them well hidden in the install apparently).

Has anyone else here had the window transparency issue and/or know how to fix it?"
,Dako420,2008-01-12T11:10Z,directory is not correct plz help me
,stiffeg,2008-01-13T14:03Z,"yeoldecaptain:

Do you have FSX SP2 WITH the ACCELRATION EXPANSION PACK?

YOU can have both?

Either sp2 or acceleration!"
,yeoldecaptain,2008-01-17T04:46Z,"Actually Acceleration comes packed with SP2.  SP2 was packed into acceleration and only later did they release it as an individual update for those who didn't buy Acceleration.  It was, as usual, yet another sly attempt by Microsoft to drum up sales on Acceleration as a bribe for folks who wanted their FSX to actually function like a sim and not like a slideshow."
,yeoldecaptain,2008-01-17T04:48Z,"Forgot to add -- on the transparency issue -- solved it -- the folks at FS apparently made it so the windows were opaque when it rained, so the folks at Flight1 released a handy tool that ""patches"" the rain BMP files and fixes the transparency issue on this and any other aircraft that were meant for FS2004 and never should have been let into FSX.  LOL."
,madasahatter,2008-01-26T10:45Z,"@palmofsweden....I think Popart is WOS.And i really don`t agree with paying for an illegal copy af anythin especialy anything for FS9/X because there are that many robbing twats out there trying to get money for crap ie.get this cloud/water/ground addon then weeks later another cloud/water/ground addon comes out , you get the drift.@Popart....I agree with ya about not upping here, because the bay as gone well shite."

,jocomiami,2009-03-27T17:51Z,Why the jetways don't work with the 777. 
,oaya123,2009-04-20T06:54Z,"I'm having some trouble with the plane. At night time the plane works fine except when you press L to turn off all the lights, everything goes white. But during the day, everything is white even if I press L to turn on the lights. Any suggestions? I also have the latest patch installed."
,Rastamusen2,2009-04-21T03:44Z,Why publish as FSX when it's just for (fs9) 2004!? 
,sumeetmore,2010-03-16T11:34Z,Nice upload. But the 777 cannot autoland. I have tried and read dozens of forums just to discover that the plane cannot autoland. I think thats a big drawback!
