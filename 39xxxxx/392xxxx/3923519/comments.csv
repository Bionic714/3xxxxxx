¿Es disco 1 de 15, como dice el título, o es curso completo?

E disco 1 di 15, come dice il titolo, o è il corso completo?"
,jdesoto79,2009-02-02T04:28Z,"Unless I am wildly missing something, this is not the compete course - each movie is only 12 minutes long!  This must be some kind of sample.  Unless one of the other seeders (I seeded it for days) knows something I don't know, this is really not worth the time to download."
,jdesoto79,2009-02-02T04:32Z,ok I figured it out this is only disk one of 4; found the others by clicking link of user lindebeare . . . thanks to all seeders; I am getting the other disks and will seed those when they are complete as well.

,addicus,2009-10-08T18:32Z,Thank you lindebeare for your kindness.  Thank you jdesoto79 for helping me figure out how to get the complete set.  This is awesome as my child asked for it this morning.

Thanks."
