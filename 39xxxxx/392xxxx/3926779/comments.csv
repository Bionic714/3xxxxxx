You have to revert back to 3.3.5

,Pepsimal,2008-05-01T22:41Z,"What's the problem with the tracker, http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org. 

This torrent, and other with the same tracker, didn't work. I had to go to isohunt.com and get it, (the same torrent) and wirh the trackers from there the download began. 

I'm running utorrent 1.7.7. Is there any problem with that client, or is it anything else.

I have been using Piratebay many years now, and I like to continue with that.

Grateful for a response."
