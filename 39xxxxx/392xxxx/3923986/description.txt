Review

Down Beat (p.69) - 3 stars out of 5 -- "Gustavsen's third outing for ECM teems with a proud melancholy....'Draw Near' has an ebullience..."
JazzTimes (p.74) - "The Gustavsen Trio's music is a serious music, airy in texture and minimalist in structure. It is melodic, but it is simple. It breathes."
