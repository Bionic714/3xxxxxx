,rivalius13,2007-12-05T17:55Z,Getting error when uTorrent tries to open it...
,rivalius13,2007-12-05T18:13Z,Working now.
,thantik,2007-12-05T19:49Z,"If I actually get this done, I'll be seeding for a couple weeks.  Sci-fi is already allowing you to watch it on their website for free, this is just a higher quality version.

Great Wizard of Oz re imagining btw.  One of those must-watches."
,southwind,2007-12-05T20:14Z,I was just wondering if this torrent is being super seeded
,miffe,2007-12-05T20:17Z,"Please stop super seeding, it's slowing everything down."
,IceBone,2007-12-05T20:37Z,"There are 10 seeds now. And how the fuck is it slowing you down, i'm uploading at 10 mbps! The whole series is 4.5 hours long. If you're gonna wait 15 more minutes, it won't kill you."
,highlander777,2007-12-05T22:49Z,Something is screwy. I see 190 peers and 4 seeds but I'm only getting 30kb/s download speed now. I was getting +200kb/s when I first connected to the swarm for about 10 minutes. Then the speed went down.
,highlander777,2007-12-05T22:56Z,It's better now.
,aramilnubin,2007-12-06T00:26Z,what's the resolution for these files?
,southwind,2007-12-06T00:44Z,Can anybody give a quality report yet?
,huckfinnifkcuh,2007-12-06T01:05Z,Feel lucky you can get speeds like that... here in the US with our crappy 11Mbps connections (that only ever hit 5Mbps... maybe) this download is going to take at LEAST a day - if not more.
,death734,2007-12-06T01:14Z,"files are regular HDTV rip encode just like scene releases. 624x352 resolution, 23.976fps. "
,joshthejest,2007-12-06T02:52Z,Going very slow...
,southwind,2007-12-06T03:16Z,There is lots of peers(i'm showing 3518 and growing) and not many seeds (45 that I can see on the stats). Alot of people want it so that is probably slowing it down. With time it will probably speed up. We have to be patient!!
,joshthejest,2007-12-06T03:25Z,When it finishes in ~14 days I will seed it... lol
,Praetor_810,2007-12-06T05:06Z,"I've never downloaded a torrent with over 1500 peers go so slow.  I've been averaging 64mb/hr.

Please everyone, set your upload speed limits higher.  My upload is unlimited right now, but it won't maintain over 50kB/s.  I must be connected to the slowest downloaders in the swarm.  I'm jealous of the jerks in my swarm reporting +400kB/s."
,Josh4721,2007-12-06T05:16Z,thank you
,southwind,2007-12-06T06:30Z,"It is strange, with almost 5000 peers my upload is only about 42 KB/s, and I have my upload speed set to unlimited (as usual). I've seen my upload rates on other torrents 3 times that much. The only thing I think may be happening is people aren't staying around to seed after they have the complete files. Please seed!!!!"
,joshthejest,2007-12-06T06:35Z,I have not been able to download anything for more than an hour... been sitting at 0B/s  same as upload... everyone in my segment must have the same data.
,avril_joy,2007-12-06T06:38Z,thanks!  :)
,GateDHD,2007-12-06T09:26Z,"Thanks.  And thanks for correcting the synch errors.  Not goin to complain about speed, just glad you posted this!  Missed part 3.  Should finish in 5-6hrs then I'll seed till my nose bleeds. ;)"
,southwind,2007-12-06T16:11Z,Quality is great. Thanks
,zploek,2007-12-06T16:28Z,"there are 2 glitches in part 3 and WTF happened to the end? what are ya, bunch of credit haters?
it's like 1.23.37s in 3rd part, so i think i am missing at least 7 minutes!! wassup with that??"
,echoecho03,2007-12-06T17:03Z,"490 seeders can't be acurate... my client shows one seeder 2 peers and over 1000 total....health is rated at 222%
I'm getting less then 1kb on the download but i am uploading no limit set on download or upload....
anywho can someone give me any tips on getting faster speed? heh short of getting a t1 line I mean.:)
thanks for the work Icebone I look forward to watching these:)

,aliasme,2007-12-06T18:32Z,its still sooo slow :(
,Chronniff,2007-12-06T20:32Z,"Not illegal, never found to be, tv is constitutionally guaranteed to be open to the public...Because of this the networks hire people to seed bogus files to saturate the torrents shares and slow down downloads....which is probably why you guys aren't getting good download rates despite it appearing to be a healthy torrent....The media networks are childish and petty....I appreciate the upload, can't find part 3 anywhere "
,southwind,2007-12-06T21:04Z,Well if there is 7 mins missing in the third part it may be more than the credits. Any one know where a complete part 3 is?
,southwind,2007-12-06T21:43Z,Actually in checking on the net it seems as though this is the way it ends. A lot of people were disappointed with the ending just cutting off. 
,Y1K_Ready,2007-12-06T23:12Z,"I got this fairly quickly, but I kept blacklisting peers that wouldn't share manually until I had enough pieces to trade."
,GateDHD,2007-12-06T23:32Z,"Gotta chime back in here...

Come On Guys!!!!  So far there are 31 comments posted and only 8 took the time to at least say Thanks to IceBone for the time and effort he put into this.  In fact, it took 17 posts before someone finally said Thanks.  I know that there are double posts, but even if you take those out, it's still pretty sad.

I know that sometimes we all get frustrated, but at least acknowledge the poster in your comments.  Be patient, it's not unusual for a torrent this popular to be slow at first.  Mine dl'd in around 8 hrs...  even triple that would not be bad for a 4.5 hr 3 part mini-series.  

Thanks again, IceBone.  We really do appreciate the work you do. (Check out some of IceBone's other torrents).....  gotta go watch part 3...."
,IceBone,2007-12-07T02:15Z,"Thanks for all the kind words, guys, even though there weren't that many, hehehe.

The difference between my other torrents and this one is that i personally encoded the others, but this one i just found the releases on a private torrent site, after looking unsuccessfully on public ones, and decided to make those unfortunate enough to have an account on those sites, a bit happier.

And yes, check out my other torrents. :P"
,southwind,2007-12-07T17:31Z,"Icebone thank you for this. As it turned out this was a good quality. Someone earlier had mentioned that there was 7 minutes missing (which was NOT the case) so I reviewed the different parts and did some research on the net and found out that indeed  all three parts were complete. As far as I know you were the first to get out all 3 parts. Again, Thanks!"
,Drowlord,2007-12-07T19:20Z,Definitely thanks.  D/Ling now.
,Y1K_Ready,2007-12-08T22:06Z,"Now that I've seen all three episodes I can report that the quality is very good.  There may be a tiny ""glitch"" in Ep 3 but if that bothers you , you should wait for the dvd.  I looked for part 2 for days after it aired and only found it at one private tracker with oppresive download rules, so thanks to Icebone for the upload and thanks also for taking care of the audio sync problems."
,Nisaea,2007-12-09T19:13Z,"Hehe... Thanks for the file!

As for those complaining of low speed: I'm getting a steady 3k/s. So shut your mouths!   :-)
"
,Beonaam,2007-12-11T01:29Z,Thank you!
,thantik,2007-12-11T04:18Z,"By the way: Not illegally.  You can go to www.sci-fi.com/tinman and watch it online for free as well.

Sound like they would mind it being passed around? - no not really."
,tony4505,2007-12-11T05:31Z,"ICEBONE, Thank you thank you thank you thank you!!!!! Hell, I just started downloading your torrent and I wanted to express my appreciation before hand!!!  "
,dropyermitts,2007-12-13T21:00Z,How can you tell who's sharing and who's strictly leaching (using Utorrent)?
,B-sh,2007-12-25T04:02Z,"to start thnx for the upload.
technically it is illegal it is a reproduction without the networks expressed consent. secondly the commercials are taken out, which it might be on the website, but they make up for that with ads on the page itself. "
,Beonaam,2007-12-29T01:43Z,The Soundtrack for Tin Man can be found at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3951654/Tin_Man_Soundtrack
,ezboard,2007-12-31T13:17Z,how do you blacklist someone using utorrent?
,toonman361,2008-01-01T19:01Z,Hello all. Just found out about this show and am happy it is available. Thanks IceBone.
,jdrake_2,2008-01-22T02:51Z,"Thanks for making this available.  Would have to disagree with others who say the quality is great - didn't find it great.  It's okay, kinda like if you were to tape it off TV onto a VHS tape.  Colours are dull and picture isn't that crisp.  But it's watchable and better than nothing - thanks IceBone."
,iketheclerk,2008-02-13T22:53Z,I heard about this series. Man I cant wait to watch it! Thanks IceBone.
,ERB3,2008-02-29T09:03Z,Hey guys... please seed! I got to see this on TV and I wanted to buy it but I can't find it. So please let me download it... Thanks so much!
,SpiderGav,2008-05-20T14:24Z,"jingo500...barely have fire lol, thats funny :) spent a month in ur amazing country last christmas, one thing u dont lack is wind lol so tis no wonder u have no fire, keeps getting blown out :D one of my favourite places in the world btw :)

,daneraw,2008-06-19T05:52Z,"its at wallmart, for like 23 bucks."
,shutupman,2009-08-05T03:00Z,"Started watching this on TV last night, they had all 3 back to back, but I had to get to bed before the 2nd finished.
Cheers for sharing this!"
