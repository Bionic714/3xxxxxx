Halo Frenzy -- By Jmastere

Contents:
Halo Disc (MDF, MDS files)
Halo Keygen (Did not make myself, but it works for me. Works also on CE)
Halo Custom Edition Installer
Alcohol 120% Trial Installer (For opening MDF and MDS files)
Hyrule Fields HaloCE Map
Resident Evil Perspective HaloCE Map

Instructions:

1) Install the Alcohol 120% trial if you don't already have it.
2) Mount the CD image
3) Open Keygen
4) Install Halo
5) Install Halo CE
6) Install the Maps

Note: You will sometimes get an alert that the CD Key is invalid. 
Just exit the game and start it back up. It always works for me.

There are no viruses in the maps, nor in the custom edition 
installer or MDF/MDS files. I downloaded the installer and maps 
from the official site, and made a direct copy of the Halo Disc. 
Though the keygen shouldn't, it didn't give me any viruses.

Please seed. I hate it when people complain about that stuff.
