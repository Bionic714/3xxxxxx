,4chaner,2009-08-19T22:24Z,"Yeah. Where are all the mp3s? How am I supposed to put this on my mp3 player.
Thanks for the overly high quality, though."

,maravis05,2010-08-07T20:21Z,"@bdfortin: Thank you very much for the up! And please don't listen to these people who have no idea what they're talking about. I'm ecstatic about the proliferation of FLAC rips. 

@losers: MP3s were created because storage was expensive and audio files were large, but they degrade the quality of the music! Now storage is cheap and we can fit all of our music in high quality formats. FLAC is lossless, meaning it sounds the same as having a cd. Your beloved MP3s are missing parts of the song. I hear it mainly in shitty cymbal crashes. Drives me crazy. Go pay a dollar on itunes for an mp3, cuz you probably only want one or two songs anyway."
