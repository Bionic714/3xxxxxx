pLOT:

This movie is about one of the worst periods for the brazilian people. Shows the days of military dictatorship when the brazilian people against the government were put in jails, tortured, and some of them assassinated by the military and para-military people. At the same time, the same government censured the press and didn't allow anything but news about three times-champion soccer team. While the people made parties, etc for the soccer team, in the underground, people suffered all kinds of torture. It's very denseful, strong and realistic movie for those who know about this period of our history.
