By Hook Or By Crook (Sammo Hung, 1980) - VCD/Rmvb

HKFlix Says:  
A very silly, yet for the most part hilarious, film that pairs up Sammo Hung and Dean Shek Tin. Not much kung fu here, but what there is is gold. 

Avg. Rating:  3.6 / 5 (based on 4 ratings). What did you think of it?  

Plot: The portly but agile Hung nimbly evades the Hong Kong police as a benevolent burglar who gives his haul to charity. An amusing martial arts comedy about a Robin Hood-like hero named "FLOWER KID" who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. 
 
Overview: "Flower Kid" was a Robin Hood-type hero who robbed the rich and gave to the poor. He was adored by many people, especially a kid named "Fatso", who considered himself a kind of "Flower Kid, Jr.". Madam Bee, a woman of guts and evil, hated "Flower Kid" because he once refused her proposal of killing her own husband. She then married a rich big shot and used his money and power to hire a bounty hunter named "Skinny". Skinny caught the "Fatso". But after they fought, they became good friends, and both went on to look for the real "Flower Kid" together...
