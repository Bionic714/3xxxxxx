,cray1000,2008-03-09T02:50Z,the michael thomas stuff is surprisingly great.  at first i hated his accent but when he actually gets into teaching its totally awesome.
,zeitgeisten,2008-04-23T00:51Z,personally i like pimsleur a bit better... michel thomas teach you to mix english and other languages together...
,microsofthateren,2008-07-19T17:34Z,pimsleur is ok ma secondo me michel thomas' program kicks pimleur's ass
,fredscotland,2008-07-20T01:30Z,"Yeah great download Michel Thomas is the best, good for learning and revising the language. Grazie molto. "
,Meddi_the_Strong,2008-08-25T18:12Z,"about the PIMSLEUR booklets:
You don't really need the booklet... The booklet contains a bunch of VERY easy to read words that belong to level 1 only. So after level 1 you don't need the booklet anymore. The ""reading"" part of this course teaches you very little about Italian; a language that's very easy to read anyway..."
