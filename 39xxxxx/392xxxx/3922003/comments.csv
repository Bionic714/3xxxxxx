,light_apprentice,2008-05-14T21:54Z,suspicious installers sux! :s
,asimpleson,2008-05-18T06:43Z,"the installer is clean and the keygens almost all will generate false AV alarms...thou shall know this with experience ;) dont worry, simply enjoy the proggy."
,asimpleson,2008-05-18T07:03Z,"@xpowerracer

the message is because of iexpress 2.0 silent installer packaged for convenience with a keygen...me too using uptodate Kaspersky, but simply ignore the false message if any. Best of luck! 

PS: I am even more cautious as a seeder. If one screws an exe virus chances are that the seeders get infected first...:) so dont worry anyone. Also the great Kaspersky's AVs Proactive Defense sucks...it even keeps haunting you every now and then for legitimate processes. I disable Proactive defense whenever I am sure about the installer source."
