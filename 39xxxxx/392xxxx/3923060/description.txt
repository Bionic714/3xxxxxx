It is much heralded amongst Beatle people for being a version of that first LP that has not been subjected to any processing or equalization. In effect, it is advertised as the "truest" and "purest" vinyl represntation of the initial 14 Beatle songs ever offered in long play form. It has been sourced from a beautiful copy of the original LP.
