This software is for the original xbox, not the 360. This is especially useful in upgrading/repairing hard drives in softmodded xbox's. For those who don't know what the eeprom is, it's probably best not to mess with this program. you can kill your xbox with this if you don't know what you are doing. This is a super powerful tool and must be used with caution...
