,Kersh,2007-12-24T22:31Z,"I can't seem to get this to work. I must be doing something wrong or does this not work with the older version of Guitar Hero III? I can't update the game because I downloaded it in the first place and when I try to update it says the game can not be found. :P

Anyway, can you explain how to use this, I've tried opening hte game and hitting Ctrl + 1/2/3/4 and also I've minimized the game and checked them off, etc;. x _x"
,Kersh,2007-12-24T23:31Z,"Okay, I got the game to update and crack. Only problem now is that when I run the trainer I get an error that reads: ""This application has failed to start because AWL.dll was not found."""
