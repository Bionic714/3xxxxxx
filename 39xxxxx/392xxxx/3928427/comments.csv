,grr_rotjeknor,2007-12-10T14:16Z,"AND THX ALOT

for al the ROMS that you do release.

your packs are great !!

I use NDScrc to check en rename my roms.
So difference in numbering is no biggie
The fact that they all check correct CRC IS ....!!!!

[T],magumagu,2007-12-17T13:50Z,"@OctoGenarian:
I can't say anything about Rominator since I haven't used it, but since the roms it doesn't recognize are the ones with the highest number, and thus the newest, do I believe that you need to update the program to recognize those as well. I'm playing 1800 - CrossworDS at the moment on my DSLite with G6Flash, so it can't be anything too much wrong with them. (And they do check out right on CRC.)

For the .bat-file: (I'm not sure if it'll show up correct though. Here goes nothing ...)
@echo off
dir /B /S *.zip |sed ""s/\.zip//"" |grep -v .tmp >output.tmp
for /F ""delims=/"" %%a in (output.tmp) do 7z e ""%%a.zip"" && 7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on -bd ""%%a.7z"" ""*.nds"" && rm ""%%a.zip"" ""*.nds""
rm output.tmp"
[T],magumagu,2007-12-17T14:02Z,"It seems to show up ok. It uses grep and sed and with those it scans through all available sub directories and repacks any zips found with 7-zip.

It's a reeaaally ugly script which I'm quite ashamed of and probably should remake in perl to make it a cute one liner. It works fine on my windo$e-box though. As always, remember TIMTOWTDI!
//joda"
[T],magumagu,2007-12-18T01:42Z,"That's the one repacking zips into 7-zips. The following should scan subfolders for .nds-files and 7-zip them up with the same name:
@echo off
dir /B /S *.nds |sed ""s/\.nds//"" |grep -v .tmp >filelist.tmp
for /F ""delims=/"" %%a in (filelist.tmp) do 7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on -bd ""%%a.7z"" ""%%a.nds"" && rm ""%%a.nds""
rm filelist.tmp

Not tested, so use at own risk though. Just remembered, this one uses rm as well from unxutils. You could probably change it for del.

,Itsara,2007-12-20T00:18Z,"THE ARM7-FIX

What?
A few dumped roms today comes with a new kind of protection, commonly referred to as the ""arm7-protection"". If you try to load a protected rom on some flash carts (R4, DS-X, G6 etc.), you will receive an error that tells you that something went wrong with your save file (or equivalent) and you will not be able to play the dumped rom. In this thread, you'll learn how to crack these roms by yourself, bypassing this protection.

If your game won't start and gives you an error message about saving data, you most likely need the arm7-fix.
A hacked arm7.bin file can be downloaded http://ds.loathsome.us/files/arm7.bin, and will do the trick for every game (per today) that requires this fix.

Brief tutorial on how to replace the arm7.bin-file:

1. Open up the rom with http://ds.loathsome.us/files/dslazy.zip and click «nds unpack»
2. A new window will now open, do not close this.
3. Copy the hacked arm7.bin-file (link earlier in this post) inside the newly opened directory (NDS_UNPACK), and replace the existing arm7.bin-file
4. Click «nds packer», select where to save the modified file and load the rom up on your flash cart.
5. Happy gaming!

1705
1718
1720
1743
1756
1794
1796

maybe others also....

Maybe the arm7-fix can bee included in the roms in the future?

Saves a lot of extra.."
,--Jacob--,2008-01-01T18:38Z,I cant find 1664 - Contra 4?
[T],magumagu,2008-01-02T08:24Z,"@Saik0Shinigami
It will be quite soon.
 Thing is, I'm at my fiancé's place abroad until the fourth, so probably not before then.
 Also, I'm finally working on a move towards the GBAtemp-list, which will generate som extra work on renumbering/repacking some roms.
 You'll have it home by this weekend, at worst.

Cheers!

[T],magumagu,2008-01-05T06:26Z,"You could use the stuff in the script, but if you're not repacking you don't need it. Just get WinRar or the 7-Zip package, mark all zips, right mouse button-drag them to another folder, and select extract-to-folder from the context menu. Then when it's done, delete the zips. Piece of cake ...
