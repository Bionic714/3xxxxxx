,SirRune,2008-01-07T17:47Z,You don't need to rename it ! You just replace it ^^
,Amd64User,2008-01-16T17:30Z,"I only said to rename the original file so you can have a backup...  But it is not a ""Have To Do"".
Just copy and paste how f-ing hard is that, when it asks what to do since there is already a file with that name click replace."
,Amd64User,2008-01-16T17:33Z,"Actualy there is a correction here,  YES YOU MUST RENAME THE (NO CD SPEED2.exe File)
Rename it to Speed2.exe once its in the folder (c:/program files/ea games/Need for speed underground 2/"
