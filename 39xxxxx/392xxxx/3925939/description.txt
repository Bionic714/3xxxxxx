Re-seed, new tracker
Three-part series which looks at Britain's part in the slave trade.

Part 1
A drama based on the life of British slave trader Henry Lascelles, the Robert Maxwell of his day and one of the richest businessmen of the eighteenth century. His descendants are now cousins of the Queen. Unlike previous dramas, this film controversially explores the lives of the white men who built this huge trade.

London, 1744 and Henry Lascelles is promoting his latest money making venture, a floating slave factory ship that aims to make the storage and sale of slaves even more efficient, and provide enormous financial returns. However, Lascelles ambitions are jeopardised when government inspector Robert Dinwiddie is instructed to investigate him on allegations of fraud.

A deadly battle of wills develops, a fight between two determined and ambitious men that takes us from the sugar plantations of Barbados to the coffee houses and taverns of London, culminating in the case coming before the highest court in the land.
