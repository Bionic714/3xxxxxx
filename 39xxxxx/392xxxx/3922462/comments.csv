,DannOrly,2007-12-21T22:33Z,"The person with the most done at this moment in time has 64%. I'm only seeding this file and nothing else... hell, I'm not even downloading anything. It's still gonna take some time. If you have this much please seed, even 5-10 kb/s per person could help."
,DannOrly,2007-12-26T23:17Z,"Okay theres a ton of you guys up in the 90's or done, please seed! =D"

,IWantToLive,2008-03-17T05:05Z,Are there any Bleach torrents that the language is spoken in english instead of japanese. Kinda like on Adult Swim.
,DannOrly,2008-03-18T10:10Z,"Yes, but the episodes released on Adult Swim are not very far past 50 at this moment in time. The regular series in Japan is up to like 164 now? And the English series is at Episode 55 I think. Trust me,  if you watch as much anime as I do, you tend to get used to the subtitles anyways. "
,TheRedKnight92,2008-07-04T04:50Z,"What cind of quality is on these episodes? DivX, DVD, or is it really bad?"
