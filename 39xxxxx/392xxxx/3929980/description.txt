Doug Stanhope - Deadbeat Hero

Doug Stanhope is an acquired taste.
He does something most comedians wouldn't dare,
which is he offends his audience. He almost sets out to do so.
But therein lies the genius.
Your not walking away just entertained, your walking away educated.

He has never done it better than in this DVD.
He covers topics like, Abortions, Freedom of Speech, Transvestites,
and yes he still talks about how much he hates babies.

He is on top form in this DVD and as the show goes to a close you will
know what his message is. I gave this DVD a ten not because it is rated
for all audiences, but because this is very good comedy.
I have seen many stand-up DVD's and no-one gives such a performance as
he does.

Enjoy !!!
