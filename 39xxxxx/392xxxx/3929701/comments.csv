Thanx again my friend. Please upload another other Professor Teaches DVD's you may have. They are helpful especially for those of us who do not have the experience you obviously have.

Thanx again!"
,BRB-BBS,2007-12-12T11:45Z,"The files are in .bin .cue format.
Start your burning program (like Nero)
and choose burn from cue sheet.
Or mount them on a virtuel drive using
Alcohol or other .iso programs.
Got a lot of other video learning stuff.
LearnKey, Lyndacom, CBT Nuggets etc.
Let me know if you want me to upload anything of it."
