,hangukxboi,2007-12-19T12:17Z,"Hey, I just want to get some feedback and info on this issue.  I have a USA NTSC wii with a wiikey installed and currently has 1.9b.  I was considering updating it to 1.9g so that I can play SMG and I came across many postings of people claiming that shortly after updating to 1.9g and doing SMG update, their wii's no longer read the back up games.  Now has anyone here experienced this problem or know anything about what went wrong for those people?  Any input will be appreciated as I do want to try SMG but don't think its worth messing up the wiikey.  Thanks in advance."

I burned it with Nero onto a DVD +R and also DVD +-RW and neither worked. Please help. Also is this the actual game or what? Thanks in advance :)
,crook16 ,2009-10-11T04:48Z,"ugh...

to rip games 

load (install) usbloader gx on your wii 

theres a feature that lets you save your own games on your hard drive so save one

then extract them from your hard disk to your computer with wbfs manager and make a torrent

if you dont have a hard drive or if you dont want to load usbloader gx then you can always help seed....

thats what i do.."
,kayez,2010-01-03T07:17Z,This game gets error code 1048 when trying to be read in 4.2u on neogamma r8.  Any suggestions????

,trom2004,2010-01-11T17:16Z,Works great on Hardmod Wii! NTSC
,isodaemon,2012-05-24T23:06Z,"For those of you that have NO F-ING CLUE what you are doing, a few words of advice:
You do NOT need a hardmodded wii, I softmodded using smash stack and it works perfectly.
There are programs to help people that are not professionals (don't kid yourself, you're not) such as MODMII (look it up). 
Using ModMii you can do many things, including:
softmod your wii, if you haven't already
Install a backup manager on your PC for game backups to be saved to a USB device (Hard or Flash drive, doesn't matter)
Install a USB Loader into the HomeBrew channel that is installed when you softmod your wii
Install a .WAD manager that can mod your IOS so you can actually LOAD the backups in the first place and install things like WiiWare you download
And the best part is: STEP BY STEP instructions customized to what you are doing!
Hope I helped some of you..."
,isodaemon,2012-05-24T23:09Z,"BTW I recommend owning or renting a copy of super smash brothers: brawl to do the softmod, it is the easiest and most reliable method and works on ALL console versions, 2.4, 3.2, even 4.3 (smash stack)"
