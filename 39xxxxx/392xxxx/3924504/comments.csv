,empty3,2010-12-02T00:59Z,"Although the music is in tact - BE WARNED that none of this is tagged.  It is a mess, in fact, so much so that I am just going to go through the bother of ripping all my CD's (i thought this would be a time - saver... nope!)
I highly recommend, if you like your music with proper tags, titles, artist info or cover photo, to get your music elsewhere."
,silveroakleaf,2010-12-22T01:32Z,"@Empty3 - you are one picky ass mo-fo...maybe after you rip your CD's, you'll take the time to share them yourself?"
