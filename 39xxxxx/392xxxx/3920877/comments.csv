,masterofxdk,2007-12-04T17:44Z,man.. that must be bad quality.. at least 192 kbps.. 128 is just to little.. so if u made a new with that it would be an awesome torrent..

And if you look at the file size it is much more reasonable. 45mb vs 90mb for the same album. As far as sound quality is concerned, quite frankly I think that 128 sounds so much better than 192 or anything above. Go buy an album. Pop it in the coomputer. Listen to it. Tell me what you think. 128 all day baby!!! If only there were seeds though... thanks for the effort skoeber. I really appreciate it."
