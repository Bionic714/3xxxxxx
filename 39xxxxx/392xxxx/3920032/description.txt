.: about :.

In 2326, rival gangs form an ultra-violent streetsports league to settle 
their deadly disputes called Speedball 2. Two teams face each other 
in bloody battles for a steel ball. Nine on nine ? in an all-out rush on
the opponents? goal. Almost any malicious move is permitted. 

The winner of the matches secures supremacy over the city.

S p e c i a l   I n f o   N o t e :

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of a packed exe 

( SpeedLauncher.exe )

as a lame virus, (coz its thebyte by byte check error of em!.) 

Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics

you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!.

(heuristics).    >>>  thank you for reading!.
