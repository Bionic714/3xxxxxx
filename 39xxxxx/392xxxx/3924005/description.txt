Desu nÃ?Â´to - The Movie and Desu nÃ?Â´to: The last name.

For the anime series, try here:

This is the non-animated movies. <b>Desu nÃ?Â´to</b> and <b>Desu nÃ?Â´to: The last name</b>. In my opinion not at all as good as the series, but still worth watching. It has it\'s good moments.
Trying to compress 37 episodes into two movies is always hard.

The movies basically follows the anime plot line with some parts cut away and some parts changed to fit into just a few hours of film.

Enjoy!
