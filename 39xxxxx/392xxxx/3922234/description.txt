Carl Hiaasen fills his novels with some of the strangest characters in fiction--and makes them work. NATURE GIRL is set in the Florida beyond Miami and Disney World, where people like Honey Santana and half-Seminole Sammy Tigertail live quiet, peculiar existences. Night telemarketer Boyd Shreave has insulted Honey with a real estate phone pitch, and she plots a bizarre revenge that brings the three characters together. Narrator Lee Adams adeptly performs the many roles in the book and makes them all seem real, though her teenager is a bit over the top in vapidness. Listeners will hate and love the appropriate people, all the time rooting for the quirky losers.
