I've downloaded the patches from the suggested sites and when I try running the .exe file from the patch .rar file, I get error message ""This application has failed to start because binkw32.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem"".  I don't know if I downloaded the wrong patch, or if I'm unraring the patch to the wrong location, but I need help.  Thanks!"
