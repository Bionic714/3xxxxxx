Have owned this on vinyl for over thirty years but haven't had a record player for the past twenty.

I just love all the modern day band-wagon jumpers who've ""discovered"" Tiny Dancer 30 years after it happened (it was never even released as a single in the UK).

But for lyrics, it's hard to beat ""Madman"".

""....I can see very well.
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well...""
