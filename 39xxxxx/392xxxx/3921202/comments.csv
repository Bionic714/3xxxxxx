,Kaluleomorir,2007-12-05T15:54Z,"Thx m8, great add on. Would it be possible for someone to share the FS Force 2.0 for FSX license?"
,palmofsweden,2007-12-05T16:50Z,"log: They have some strange copy protection, which is different depending on what computer you install it on. And I donÂ´t think a rip is possible either since its the same protection."
,loggie,2007-12-05T17:19Z,"@palmo.. i understand hmm really really bad, i tried the demo and it lookes amazing....the same with florence X...."

,klootzakje,2007-12-11T15:13Z,"I GOT IT TO WORK PEOPLE, 
my english is not super sorry for that.

1) first, use google and find out how to set up your pc to show the hidden files(maps)

2) go to, C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Temp 

3) Wacth it cloosly and then start the installation of VeniceX_V100, you will see a change in C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Temp, 2 maps will be extra added.

4) 1 map is with stuff from the scenery, you will not find ascrypt in that one, search for another one, there you will find ascrypt and then overwrite it with the crack.

5) continue the installation, it will give a error for fsx not found, just click continue, you will then see the screen to put the code & registration, just click again continue and it wil start the installation :) 

works perfect with mij vista, playing it right now and it?s a fun airport Venice. 

Sorry for the language, Englisch is hard for Croatian people hehe. Have fun . "

,NGC001,2007-12-30T13:13Z,"I cannot find ""C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Temp "" on Vista.  Where else might the files be?"
