==PLOT=====================>

Episode 5: THE PARLIAMENT OF DREAMS 
A religious convocation in the heavens! Earth Central's decision to hold a 
festival for all alien faiths is a good idea. Yet it's a living hell for 
G'Kar when he learns one arriving "faithful" is an Assassins Guild agent 
hired to kill the Narn ambassador. 

Episode 6: MIND WAR
Sinclair's position on Psi corps is perfectly clear. "Get out of my head!" 
he orders. But getting Bester and his fellow mind-reading officer out of 
the station is another matter. There on the thought-trail of what they say
is a rogue telepath with awesome telekinetic powers. 

Episode 7: THE WAR PRAYER
Babylon 5 stretches miles from one end to the other but there's not one inch 
available on board for racism. So Sinclair and Garibaldi act quickly when 
clandestine Home Guard members attempt a violent anti-alien campaign. 

Episode 8: AND THE SKY FULL OF STARS
What happened when Sinclair blacked out while leading his fighter squad 
during the fierce Earth-Minbari War? The answer is so vital to an Earth-based 
supremacist group that it sends two covert Knights to cyberlock onto the 
commander's memories.
