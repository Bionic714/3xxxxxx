,kraut58,2007-12-20T00:37Z,"Down load with caution! Cant understand why it needs internet access to operate! Then my anti-virus program (Anti Virus Kit) shows a virus with Microsoft IE after running this program.

A word to the wise ..."
,shankjunk,2007-12-20T08:02Z,"Something wrong it could be a false positive
The exe file from the official site of O&O
so there is no question of a virus 
The serial should work
Needless to say never update cracked software!
Disable connect to the net in options"
,stilljacktwenty,2008-01-30T11:04Z,works perfect.  Thanks
,j_sodf,2008-03-01T00:01Z,"This doesn't work on Vista 64. IÂ´ve tried different torrents, but O&O doesn't seem to be modified for vista64 yet..."
,g8x,2008-03-14T18:17Z,"i tried the serial, but it still says it has a 30 day trial

,TehRealMrWiggles,2008-04-15T15:37Z,"Works great for me, thanks :)"
,octo1,2008-04-19T12:44Z,Thank you. Works perfectly.
,heavyal,2008-05-05T18:29Z,O&O Defrag is set up so that you can actually defrag over a network which is why programs such as Zone Alarm or other firewalls will tell you it's trying to access the 'trusted zone' or something similar. If you don't allow it access the drives won't even show up. It's not a bug and it's not a virus. This has been their method of operation since the inception of the program. I've been using it since around version 6 and it always gets the job done quickly and efficiently.
,Sraigux,2008-05-31T09:35Z,serial not working
,fandrew,2008-06-17T11:24Z,"I can confirm that this installer doesn't work for 64-bit Vista. Installer halts after configuration with error message:

""This Software requires Windows 2000 or better""

Actually he's right, Vista64 is worse... ;)"

,euthyphro,2008-08-27T14:43Z,I get the same vista 64 bit error message as mentioned above for 64 bit xp... Guess it doesnt work for 64 bit os... anyone else verify this?
,brutal1236,2008-08-30T14:57Z,"see http://www.oo-software.com/home/en/support/faq/oodefrag/
""64-bit version available""
I think the program is simply buggy"
,heffaklump,2008-09-07T22:04Z,"Just successfully used the ""Boss Nass"" serial! :)"
