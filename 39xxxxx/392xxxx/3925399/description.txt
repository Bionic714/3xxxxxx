I previously posted only the "Hustle Up" track contained here, in advance to release; and so here is the full release since the schedule is now undergoing reconstruction with amendments.

As usual, both tracks flaunt the distinct excellence, sophisticated creativity and unique flair we have come to always expect from our beloved Swedish born hero, John Dahlback.



Those of you already well acquainted with the scope of my tastes, and also my release schedule prior to Demonoid taking a rest... please bear patience.

There is still a bit of re-posting to tend to, thereby re-laying the foundations and recalling the general audience which is of utmost importance in order to sustain seeding of every post as we go along; I anticipate that schedule reconstruction will be complete by Christmas / New Year.  Once complete, rest assured that I will be back in glorious form with cutting edge up-to-press releases and particular selections covering every shade of distinctly excellent house music.


I thank you all for your kind efforts thus far;  the release schedule simply cannot be sustained without your continued appreciation and support.


Enjoy and please seed.
