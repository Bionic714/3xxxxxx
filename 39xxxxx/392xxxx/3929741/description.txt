Booka Shade - Numbers EP 2007 (DJ-Kicks) [Tech House / Minimal Techno]


I'm going to switch up the flavour a bit in the next few days, in order to re-establish some foundations on the more tech house and minimal techno side of things.

And how better to begin, than with our extremely talented and most beloved Booka Shade..?

Those of you who have been enjoying the recent DJ-Kicks compilation release mixed by Booka Shade should certainly want to listen to their own contained prouductions in their entirety for your further pleasure.

Those of you who may not be familiar with this artist are strongly advised to give it a try... you stand to loose nothing by keeping an open mind.

Re-post.



ALL contained tracks are simply outstanding productions.  My predominant inclinations are towards the Club Mix of "Numbers" and "Estoril" because you get a bit more ass-shaking out of them.

However, the grace and sensuality of both the Extended versions will never fail to bring utter warmth and joy to my heart.
