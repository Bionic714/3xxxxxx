,traderboi,2008-01-30T16:13Z,"Just used first key to activate Office H&S.  Worked perfectly.  Then downloaded a template to test MS Genuine Advantage.  Worked perfectly!  Much thanks.

Suggest use other keys in case MS flags the first one."
,supsnap,2008-02-04T20:37Z,"Seems like no one has a solution to the confirmation code. Serial key is working but once you start any office application it will then ask you to register/activate your office with a confirmation code. If you do it using internet option it fails saying ""specified product key has been activiated the maximum number of times"". Has anyone had any luck retrieving a confirmation code? SOME PLEASE OFFER A SOLUTION FOR CONFIRMATION CODE! "

,TheRyan95,2008-11-26T04:26Z,"Message for everyone who dammit ""supposedly"" said that it doesn't work: Dammit, I am paranoid of people who fail to do everything before posting. Ok, here are clear instructions: 
1. Download Office 2007
2.Paste Key.
3. Wait for Office 2007 be installed.
4.On startup of Office 2007 App, Do a Telephone Activation, Mostly likely it will work. 

Sorry about that first sentence and Good Luck."
