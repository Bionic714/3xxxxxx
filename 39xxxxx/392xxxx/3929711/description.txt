Set in Texas in the 1950s, SECONDHAND LIONS tells the touching story of Walter (Haley Joel Osment),
a shy teenager sent to stay with two estranged uncles for the summer. Various rumors surround the two
uncles (played by Robert Duvall and Michael Caine), mostly because the duo have only recently resurfaced
into family life after 40 years spent carrying out misdeeds and illicit activities.
