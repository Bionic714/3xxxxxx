,Deputy276,2008-08-29T21:00Z,C'mon...seed this thing!!! :-)
,drandrauf,2009-01-10T17:26Z,Just completed download and install. Works great. Great game. Thanx verrrrrrrrry much.
,ccajon,2009-04-08T20:18Z,"I downloaded it, but I could not get it to open on my computer-it says that it did not install properly.
I unzipped the files, then burned the cue to the cd, then installed it that way. Is there another way to install the game with these bin files?"
[T],Knaster,2009-04-09T00:31Z,It should work by just mount the Bin file with daemon tools. If you get a corrupt install do a defrag and try install again.
,ccajon,2009-04-09T14:52Z,Thank you that worked. The game works fine now. Thanks for the UL.
,ccajon,2009-11-06T23:44Z,"Anybody got a new serial number for this, the one on the readme notes is not working. Thanks. I had to re-install the game."
,kekburlol,2010-06-11T00:22Z,"Awesome torrent mate. Gonna seed it for a bit.

If you cold get your hands on the newest part of the series, ""Command Ops: Battles from the Bulge"" it would be really mind blowing."
,Typhos,2010-08-13T19:37Z,The serial number still works. I just installed this today and used the one included in the notes. More Matrix Games uploads please!
,grider,2011-01-05T05:46Z,"TY for this upload.

Anyone see the newer Battles from the Bulge in this series?"
,Sohan11,2011-02-21T05:53Z,Seed plz

,Deputy276,2011-10-29T23:44Z,Can someone please seed this? I want to try it out before buying.
