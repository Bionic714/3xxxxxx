BEFORE PARTITIONING CREATE A RECOVERY CD!

I've worked with partitioning software many times before and never had a problem but this time something went wrong.  I'm on a brand new machine running Vista and there was a crash while it was configuring everthing. When I rebooted it gave an error and I could not get to the Vista recovery startup and my OEM recover cd didn't work either. Luckily I had another machine here and was able to make the paragon recovery cd which fixed everything....


Just take 5 minutes and create the recovery cd, its one of the options in the program...that way if anything goes wrong it'll fix it for you....

have fun....

Thx for the up."
