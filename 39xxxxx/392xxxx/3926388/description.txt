This documentary is the British dubbed version of the 1999 PBS documentary "The trillion dollar bet".
This documentary features interviews with Myron Scholes and Robert Merton who , with the late Fischer Black, developed the Black-Scholes model (option pricing formula). There is also a good deal about the (in)famous hedgefund "Long Term Capital Management) LTCM, which at its pinnacle controlled positions valued at $1200 billion!
Bankruptcy was narrowly avoided in the late 90's with a massive bailout, arranged by the New York FED, by the world's largest banks. There was a fear that global financial markets would seize to work if the fund went bust.

This is a great documentary for anyone working with or studying finance or simply have a general interest in the subject.
