It seems that IÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½m the official Spawn comics uploaded for thepiratebay, which is a shame because it is a very nice comic.

I\'ve uploaded first 150 issues, and here are some more plus all special editions that I have. Some are missing which means I havenÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t bothered getting them as they were not very interesting to me. I specially recommend Spawn - The Dark Ages as it is my favourite.

Here are my previous uploads

For all you spawn fans,
nki ;)

PS
Once again .cbr or .cbz are .rar or .zip files that had their extension renamed, for example: Spawn_171.rar is now Spawn_171.cbr. Than CDisplay, comics reader, is default  for those files.
