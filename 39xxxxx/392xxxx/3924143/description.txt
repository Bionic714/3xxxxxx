He helps an old woman and she lodges him at her home. ZatÃ´ichi gambles and the old lady's nephew, a complete loser, becomes close to him and ZatÃ´ichi helps him in the bets. They meet the geishas Seitaro 'Osei' Naruto (DaigorÃ´ Tachibana) and Okinu Naruto (Yuuko Daike), actually a brother and a sister that have been chasing the killers of their parents, Inosuke, Tashichi and Kuchinawa, for ten years seeking revenge.
