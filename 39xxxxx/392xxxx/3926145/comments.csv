,SuperJer,2009-01-13T03:45Z,"This is a great soundtrack, but this recording is no good.  For anyone looking for a high quality rip, look elsewhere.  This recording is very prone to clipping (distortion during louder portions of the recordings, due to poor audio ripping software).  Rippers should preview their rips before uploading."
