August Rush: Music From The Motion Picture

Amazon.com
Who knew Jonathan Rhys Meyers had such an aching, lovely croon? In August Rush, he supplies his own vocals in the role of an Irish indie-rock singer, and it's a testament to his skill that he doesn't embarrass himself on Van Morrison's "Moondance." (He's even better on Lucas Reynolds' "Something Inside.") This is fairly representative of this CD's flavor: thoughtful, adult but not bland--typically, you hear a lot of cello throughout. John Ondrasik, stepping out from his Five for Fighting persona, wrote new material, though the best song, "King of the Earth," is an unreleased one by his main project that boasts superb, elegant production by Bill Bottrell. Intriguingly, guitar virtuoso Kaki King is the hand double for Freddie Highmore, who plays the film's child prodigy. Her two instrumentals, "Bari Improv" and "Ritual Dance," are treats for lovers of inventive acoustic playing, who should also enjoy the self-explanatory "Dueling Guitars." John Legend sounds aching on "Someday," though the cover of "God Bless the Child," by Chris Botti and Paula Cole, feels a little lite. --Elisabeth Vincentelli
