Mysterious raider attacks in various stargrids puts Babylon 5 on alert and 
sends Ivanova and Flightwing Delta scrambling into action. Adding to the 
mystery: the arrival of a seer who foretells explosive doom for the station.

No rounds. No rules. No gloves. To these decrees, alien followers of the

from Earth aims to knock that edict flat. Plus, a rabbi guides Ivanova in a
long-overdue ritual of shiva. 

Episode 15: GRAIL
The quest of a cosmic wayfarer for the legendary Holy Grail brings him
to the station and into a man-vs.-monster, mind-to-mind showdown with an
unholy foe: the tentacled, brain-erasing Nakaleen Feeder. 

Episode 16: EYES
Does Sinclair have something to hide? An Earth Force colonel takes command 
of the station when Sinclair and his frontline officers refuse to submit to

hide is the new commander.
