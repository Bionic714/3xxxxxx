==PLOT=====================>

Episode 1: MIDNIGHT ON THE FIRING LINE
Will the space station that is the universe's last, best hope give way to no 
hope? Station leaders face the sabre rattling of potential war when a 
mysterious attack on agrarian planet Raghesh 3 brings long-festering hatreds 
between Centauri and Narn races to a boil. 

Episode 2: SOUL HUNTER 
He's feared by all. And no wonder: the collector of souls who's slipped aboard 
is a renegade who murders beings instead of waiting for them to die. 

Episode 3: BORN TO THE PURPLE 
When it comes to political manipulation, Londo Mollari knows where the 
skeletons are buried: his "purple files" hold scandalous secrets about 
Centauri's royal families. But when it comes to love, even wily Londo may 
fall victim to a plan to seduce those hush-hush tales from him. 

Episode 4: INFECTION 
Smuggled aboard by a scientist: remnants of living machines. Unending peril, 
too, when a human infected by the contraband morphs into a perfect warrior 
with a mission to wipe out all imperfect beings..... making each resident
a target!
