Well, Here It Is...I Like This software A Lot. I cant Find any Serial number. But Its Worth buying. I am Going To buy it real Soon because I like it A lot. I Have to wait to do so because i dont want to bounce no checks or get any overdrafts if i debit it too soom. but i been putting it off and spending my money but the APE Ripper it worth buying and the three times the trial mode allowes does the job real well...it extracts and names the songs for you. However you can also download the CUE Splitter i just put up for download..lit does the same job, but i will tell you one thing...CUE splitter extracts, but it extracts in into FLAC files. So you need nero Flac Plug -in...or the dbPowerAMP Music Converter with its codecs. i may put it up there in a bit. Power Amp music  Converter is definately worth buying too...i will buy this software as soon as i can because like it a lot.
