How do I update this????"
,Ronux,2007-12-06T18:41Z,You need to run the WoW-220-enUS patch. It will update your game all the way to 2.2.0 then you use the WoW-2.2.0.7272-to-2.2.2.7318-enUS-patch.exe to bring you up yo 2.2.2 then WoW-2.2.2.7318-to-2.2.3.7359-enUS-patch.exe for 2.2.3.

first  change your realmlist.wtf to this 

set realmlist us.logon.worldofwarcraft.com
set patchlist us.version.worldofwarcraft.com 

overwrite everything
then go to https://signup.worldofwarcraft.com/trial/10dayfreetrial.htm
and create a trial account
then start the game login with your trial acount
and it will automatically update
then change your realmlist.wtf
bact to

knightslegion.servegame.org

create an account there and it will work"

,snakeman_HEH,2007-12-23T13:10Z,"nevermind the registration part i managed to make an account there.. so now all that is left is the patches when i open the realmlist.wtf file it only has ""set realmlist"" but not ""set patchlist"" since the patches didnt work. can i still write there ""set patchlist knightslegion.servegame.org"" anyway even if it doesnt has ""set patchlist"" there??"

,Garnatian,2008-01-05T13:47Z,"I'm new here and look at me. I need no help. All you new people have to do is thoroughly read the comments like I did and find the answer,, like I did.


!!******************************!!
!!*pickleherhar's advice works 100%*!!
!!******************************!!

I'll just explain what you have to do to get the game working etc.

1.Download the torrent.

2.Mount the images in the World of Warcraft folder inside the folder you downloaded (USING Daemon Tools!!) In numerical order.

3.Do not attempt to patch because they do not work. Instead you will have to follow pickleherhar's advice and do the following:

1.Go To: https://signup.worldofwarcraft.com/trial/10dayfreetrial.htm

2.Click ""Create Free 10-Day Account""

3.Put the correct word in from the box to pass the security check.

3.Put the correct details in for your account and create your user i.d. and then verify it. (P.S. There is no need for e-mail verification so you can put any e-mail in that you like)

4.Run the game you have recently installed. (World Of WarCraft for the idiots who don't know) and then sign in with the trial account you just created.

5.It should then automatically start downloading patch data to update.

6.After all that is finished and it's fully updated. You can being from step 3. on Ronux's guide at the top of this page. (Ronux is the uploader of the torrent.)

Thank you to Ronux and pickleherhar for the help! and I hope this will help people."
,Garnatian,2008-01-05T13:50Z,"Sorry for the spelling mistakes ^_^

 Also I'd like to point out that if the guide doesn't work make sure you check the current date and the date of my post. For all you know it could be months old and well things change and it won't always work."

2.Mount the images in the World of Warcraft folder inside the folder you downloaded (USING Daemon Tools!!) In numerical order.

3.Do not attempt to patch because they do not work. Instead you will have to follow pickleherhar's and TheRedDevilSS' advice and do the following:

5.Run the game you have recently installed. (World Of WarCraft for the idiots who don't know) and then sign in with the trial account you just created.

5.It should then automatically start downloading patch data to update.

6.Now look carefully. There are a total of 3 updates in all. You're only supposed to install 2 of those updates. The first 2. So it really should be hard to do. They are:

1st - WoW-1.12.0-enUS-patch
2nd - WoW-1.12.x-to-2.0.1-enUS-patch

7.After you've installed them don't go to play the game yet! Because it will ask you to download and install the new update !!WHICH YOU DON'T WANT!!

8.NOW - Follow Ronux's (The Torrent's Uploder) steps. Starting from step 2. The patches should now work successfully. 

!!!!BUT!!!!

After each installation of the patch the game launcher will open and download some data and attempt to download the update that I told you not to get earlier. CANCEL THE DOWNLOAD!!

9.After you've installed the 3rd and final patch (Remember they have a specific order):

1st - WoW-220-enUS-patch.exe
2nd - WoW-2.2.0.7272-to-2.2.2.7318-enUS-patch.exe
3rd - WoW-2.2.2.7318-to-2.2.3.7359-enUS-patch.exe

Anyway, as I was saying. After you have installed the 3rd and final patch, again the download manager will attempt to download the update I told you not to get. CANCEL IT. To stop this you must not make sure the game connects to the private server. To do this follow Ronux's (The Torrents Uploader) guide from step 3.

10.After all that is done. You should be able to successfully get into the game.

Thank you ^_^

,furiousa,2008-03-24T22:01Z,"UPDATE ISNTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (as of March 24th, 2008)

Holy crap, it was a mission to get this damn game installed properly. At first I thought I should let everyone figure it out for themselves (since that would keep stupid people from playing on the server), but for the sake of saving everyone some headaches, here's how to get the game *properly* installed and running on the knightslegion.com server.

1) Download this torrent, and READ THIS INFO (since there are other file you have to download too).

2) There is an ""instructions.txt"" file in this torrent. Follow the first step in this file:

""1.Mount World Of Warcraft (Disc1).iso and install, when asked, mount World Of Warcraft (Disc2).iso. Follow this step with Disc 3 and Disc 4. There is several diffrent kinds of software out to mount your image files, most common is Daemon Tools, you can get it for free at http://www.daemon-tools.cc"".

(Some people seem to be having trouble mounting the images - I used MagicISO and its Magicdisk counterpart to do the mounting. I made 4 virtual drives and mounted all 4 ISOs at the same time. It installed the game without asking for any disks. You don't have to use MagicISO/Magicdisk, I'm just telling you what worked for me.)

3) The ""instructions.txt"" file says to ""Run WoW-220-enUS-patch.exe"" next - but if you try, you'll get an error saying that you need version 2.0.0.6080 (or something like that). SO, download the patches below to bring you up to 2.0.0.6080.

1.12.0
http://files.filefront.com/World+of+Warcraft+v1120+US+Patch/;5441790;/fileinfo.html

And 1.12.x-to-2.0.1
http://files.filefront.com/World+of+Warcraft+Before+the+Storm+Patch+English/;6302850;/fileinfo.html

(The above links are from ""Mikuz at 2007-12-24 14:09 CET"", page 2 of the comments

4)Go ahead and follow step 2 of ""instructions.txt"":

2. Run WoW-220-enUS-patch.exe, WoW-2.2.0.7272-to-2.2.2.7318-enUS-patch.exe, and WoW-2.2.2.7318-to-2.2.3.7359-enUS-patch.exe in that order.

5) Install these two patches. (The following text is taken directly from http://www.knightslegion.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=22&Itemid=41):

2. Install World Of Warcraft : Burning Crusade (You can use this link to download it, but it's a torrent file, so you will need UTorrent) :
http://www.knightslegion.com/files/patches/WoW-BurningCrusade-enUS-Installer-full-downloader.torrent

3. Then you need to patch it to make it compatible our server version which 2.3.0 (You can use this link to download it, but it's a torrent file, so you will need UTorrent) :
http://www.knightslegion.com/files/patches/WoW-2.3.0-enUS-patch.torrentWoW-2.3.0-enUS-patch.torrent

6) DESPITE LOTS OF CONFLICTING INFO found everywhere, as of March 24 2008, the knightslegion server is using version 2.3.3! So, go ahead, load the game, and let it update itself to 2.3.3. If you use any version other than this, you'll have to downgrade (not going into that). 

7) Edit your realmlist.wtf file (most likely in C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\realmlist.wtf), and change it to:	

set realmlist knightslegion.servegame.org
set patchlist knightslegion.servegame.org

You don't have to change where it reads patchlist, but if you don't, Blizzard might upgrade you to a patch incompatible with the server, and you'll run into headaches. (For those really new to computers, right click on realmlist.wtf, select ""Open With..."", and choose notepad).

8)Run over to http://www.knightslegion.com/ and set up your free account!

9)Run the game, enter your account info, and enjoy :].

NOTES:
#Head over to http://www.knightslegion.com/ and read its mainpage for news - namely server updates (in case it's using a version newer that 2.3.3).

#PeerGuardian seems to think that knightslegion.com's IP address is a fake emule server, so if you have PG running while you try to connect to KL, you'll have to right click on the listing that blocks 72.51.39.152 and select ""allow 72.51.39.152 permanently"". PG also blocks blizzard's servers, but I wouldn't recommend allowing their IP's permanently. 15 mins, maybe.

Also, it always seems to fail when writing the mpq files, if that helps."

I uninstalled the game and erased it from my Computer, then I downladed the 10-day free trial (the free account is the trial, not the game) and since I already had a knights legion account I could log in with that one! 

So now I'm playing the game for free and the game updates itself.

Hope this works for anyone that could'nt made this torrent work.

PS: I even have Vista, so if it works for it, it'll probaly work for other computers"

1. Download world of warcraft
2. Download burning legion
3. Install Wow
4. Install Burning legion
5. Download patch WoW-2.4.0-enUS-patch
6. Download patch WoW-2.4.0.8089-to-2.4.1.8125-enUS-patch
7. Install patch 2.4.o and after that the second one.
8. Change the realmlist in your wow map to KNIGHTSLEGION.GAME-SERVER.CC

then download:

,habib86,2008-10-17T14:54Z,anyone know how to mount mpq files or ow to install world of warcraft plz
,happierdragon,2008-10-21T15:09Z,"guyz
after 2days of working through the torrents contents.
it now works and the game is really really awsome, it does work.

i used a mounting program called alcohol,gr8 program,many ppl are having trouble mounting and i cant see how  :)
once you have a mounting program installed its really simple.
read the buttons and menu's,get familiar.

the login problem is due to your game being the right copy(version) currently it is required by the server site to have a v2.4.3 version to enter there server.

1,download this torrent and install the stone age version  lol

2,copy n paste this link as going direct may not work http://files.filefront.com/World+of+Warcraft+v1120+US+Patch/;5441790;/fileinfo.html once downloaded,update

3,this one too http://files.filefront.com/World+of+Warcraft+Before+the+Storm+Patch+English/;6302850;/fileinfo.html and update aswell

4,download burning crusade http://www.knightslegion.com/files/patches/WoW-BurningCrusade-enUS-Installer-full-downloader.torrent
 and install

5,run the game and an automatic updating proccess will begin,update all the way to v2.4.3, id say you need 10GB to cover the install proccess

6,go into your installed wow folder and open realmlist with ''NOTEBOOK or some other txt document opener and delete what you see,replace with this exactly word for word

set realmlist knightslegion.servegame.org
set patchlist knightslegion.servegame.org

and save, close.

7,visit 
http://www.knightslegion.com/ 
and sign up your account.

listen,,,,,this is it,start the game and login.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cant login?check the site i gave you and check the version needed,as maby it been updated while ive been on here.

cant mount?learn how its easy and my page space is runnin low  lol.

step by step this works,trust"
,happierdragon,2008-10-21T15:20Z,"and yes this is US not EU or GB,
