,AntiScam,2012-01-25T19:43Z,Thanks but I do not see any trackers. Then slow download works only by DHT and Peer Exchange !
,AntiScam,2012-01-25T19:50Z,"There is another copy of the same torrent file on btjunkie that has trackers. It increased the download speed from 2.5kbytes into 300kbytes !

Check Google to get the link "
