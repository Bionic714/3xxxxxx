Notes:
On his way to America in March '69 Hendrix was asked about his plans and he said, 
`I'm working on my own album called The First Rays Of The New Rising Sun, on 
which I am having a string section and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. It's going to 
straighten a lot of people out (laughs). There's another album to come from the 
Experience...title Little Band Of Gypsys. It's a jam type album.' Jimi had plans to 
produce a quick `jam album' to pay off part of the settlement stemming from the 
nagging lawsuit.

In Hollywood in late March he told a reporter `We have to go to New York to record 
from the first to the seventh and get our new LP and single together.' Asked what the 
title was, Jimi answered `Freedom or Both Ways. The LP will probably be called 
Freedom, or either Band Of Gypsys, and the single is Freedom.'

Mid-way through the final Experience tour spring 1969, Jimi reached Charleston and 
told the Gazette, `We're bored with the Experience. We've got to do some of our own 
things. That could include everything from acoustical guitar to the Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir. We're not sure what the title will be, but I think we'll call it The 
End Of The Beginning. Music is stronger that politics. I think the answer lies in 
music.'

In Toronto for arraignment on possession charges in June, Jimi told the Globe and 
Mail, `My next album, coming out in late summer, will be called Shine On Earth, 
Shine On, or Gypsy Sun. The Christmas album will be called First Rays Of The New 
Rising Sun. There Might be also a couple of other albums in between. A live `Albert 
Hall' album which we cut in London and a greatest hits thing. But I have no control 
over them...We have about fourty songs in the works, about half of them complete. 
A lot of it comprises jams - all spiritual stuff, very earthy.'

This collection uses Jimi Hendrixâ??s original handwritten track lists for sides 
A to C  (Disc 1). Side D (on Disc 2) is compiled with most possible contenders, 
Unfortunately, Jimi's passing meant that his concept remaines unfinished so 
possible side D and a few more unfinished tracks are all  included on Disc Two.
