Fortunately for us, he did.

I should have also mentioned, this is Xvid encoded, with AC3 audio in an AVI envelope.

If you watch past the end of the movie, you will be treated to warnings of hellfire and dire agony.  It is an interesting contrast to the last speech given in the film.

Chaplin would have despised and loathed the MPAA, and all of the constipated pontifications that men of mediocrity are trying to force us to live under, in the name of ""Globalization"".

Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, Charles Chaplin never lived to see the current world, or he would have realized that national boundaries and national sovereignty are the only means free men have for a chance for liberty.

Heil Hinkel.
