,brianxxx,2008-02-29T18:53Z,"I'm a real estate agent and trust me when I saw almost every agent laughs their asses off when people come to us like miners looking for Alaskan gold! lol The truth is, these methods are not fully realistic, Beck and other 'gurus' never tell you the whole story. Plus, most of their methods try to teach you very illegal methods that almost every state will prosecute you for when the bank notifies them of your intentions. "
,CrimsonDeathBed,2008-08-12T22:33Z,"I can say that investing in Tax Deeds is not as easy as it's made out to be here, but there is legitimacy to this. Almost every state either auctions off or takes first come first serve during annual or semi-annual tax deed sales. If you even Google ""county tax sales"" you'll see thousands come from states all over the country. Truth is, you could figure out most of what there is to know by actually going to the county website. Beck just does the legwork and puts it in a pretty package. If you're lazy, it might be worth it. I am a real estate investor myself, and most the methods the gurus talk about are real, however they rarely give you enough to do it on your own. Real investors know the best way to learn is with another successful investor as I did. Most real estate agents have no idea what you can do with creative investing and dismiss it readily, and I don't usually argue with them, I just cash my checks."
