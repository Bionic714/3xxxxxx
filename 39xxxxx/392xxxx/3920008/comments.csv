,DARKSUPR3MACY,2011-05-27T04:25Z,"It's quest for infinity.  And I don't know if it's because I patched the region from PAL to NTFS, (I'm about to reburn it just as PAL), but its black and white.  I will still continue to seed however.  Thanks for the upload"
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2011-05-27T05:15Z,"Nevermind, just reburnt with no patches or anything and it boots up black and white.  If you don't mind that the game runs perfectly.  It's just black and white which drives me insane so I'll find another link.  I'll seed for another day"
