Leon Redbone's odd voice always takes a while to get used to, but his sincere interpretations of early jazz styles generally win audiences over. For this warm session, he sings 11 Christmas songs, including old favorites ("White Christmas," "Frosty the Snowman" and "Let It Snow") and some lesser-known but worthy numbers ("There's No Place Like Home for the Holidays," Terry Waldo's "That Old Christmas Moon," and the classic title cut). Joined by pianist Dr. John, the versatile John Gill (tripling on banjo, drums and bass sax), three strings, and clarinetist Bobby Gordon, among others, Leon Redbone's joyous performance should please his fans.
