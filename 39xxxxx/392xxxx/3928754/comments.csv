,Furberg,2007-12-23T00:27Z,"Hei! Har et lite spørsmål ang. nedlasting:
Bruker Azerius!

Ved nedlasting står det f.eks 21(150) Dette betyr at det er 21 jeg er tilkoblet og 150 i svermen... hva kan jeg gjøre for å bli tilkoblet flere av de 150?:S 

When I download a torrent I have f. eks 21 on-line and 150 in swarm... What can I do to get more on-line?

På forhånd takk:D
Thx:D"
