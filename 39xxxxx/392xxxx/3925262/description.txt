back cover:
Jump aboard A-Train and get on the fast track to fame and fortune-or failure and bankruptcy.

You'll start with a bit of bare land and a small bank loan, then establish transportation systems, buy and sell land and businesses, and even invest in the stock market.  If all goes well, you'll be rich and powerful.  Then you can hop a train and take a first-person 3-D joy ride through your empire.  If all doesn't go well...well, you'll have to find out for yourself.  Trains, power and money -- what more could you want.
