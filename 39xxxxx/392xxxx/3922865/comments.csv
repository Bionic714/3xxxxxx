,shipz2640,2011-10-24T22:01Z,"Thanks for uploading this. I remember the first time I watched this movie. I was really wanting to watch a movie bad and my Grandma and Father ordered this for me on PPV. At the time I was only 10 and really enjoyed the movie and found it really easy to get attached to the characters.

Downloading this now. I can't wait to watch it again. Now that I'm much older I'll be able to get a better idea of what's really happening."
