Pryda Vs. Tears For Fears - Genesis Vs. Shout (Peter Brown Bootleg 2007) [Electro / Progressive House]


As if the superb production of "Genesis" isn't special enough on it's own, here it is overlaid with a extremely well selected vocal... all neatly mashed up into an even more highly sought after bootleg vinyl.



There is no discogs entry for this release as yet...
