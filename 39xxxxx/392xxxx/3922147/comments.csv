,electroacoustic,2007-12-28T15:04Z,"After installation, you should apply fix from folder Fix/fxbox_fix.exe. This one remove protection called ""Demo Stuff"" from FX BOX. Then you can run program."

,DJorDJE02,2008-02-21T21:27Z,"When I want to start it, an error message says : Error opening Wave input device! What should I do?"
,DJorDJE02,2008-02-21T21:28Z,Forgot to mention : this happens when I click the Start button.
,electroacoustic,2008-02-27T20:35Z,Check your program settings.
,obugger,2008-03-02T20:43Z,i get a message saying error opening wav device sample rate not supported.  How do i fix this and what kind of cabl do i connect my guitar to the computer with? thanx in advance
,electroacoustic,2008-03-02T22:23Z,Try change sample rate in settings. To connect guitar use standard cable with you connecing guitar to power amp. In sound card install jack-minijack converter (connect it to microphone or line-in).
,a1ex666,2008-08-07T12:22Z,Anybody has a crack to version 2.7?
,semp666,2008-10-15T17:36Z,i have vista too and it works fine
,Hudi-PB,2009-10-14T14:07Z,"It works on Vista too!

1.: Right click on the shortcut -> Properties -> Compatibility
2.: Select Run with the following compatibility mode: Windows XP (Service Pack 2), then click OK
3.: Run the program, go in to Setup -> Advanced
4.: Change the Input and Output operation mode to Compatibility and disable the Conpensate sample rate differences option
5.: In the Setup menu for the I/O Devices I recommend for the Input: Line-In / Output: Speakers

Note: If you hear clips or pops, just click on Stop and Start again, or Restart the program.

My config: Vista SP1, Integrated Realtek HD Audio (ALC662) - Driver version R2.31, Eko S300 E-Guitar (Stratocaster shape, Sunburst color)

TPB forever!"
