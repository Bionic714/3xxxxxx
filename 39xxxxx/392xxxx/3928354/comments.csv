Seriously, WTF is wrong woth some people?
Yeah, I know FLAC can be a pain, and WAVE can be too big, and not everyone can figure out how to deal with an ISO, but come on!

128 bit MP3s?
Was this torrent ripped back in 1998?

Is 320 CBR in the 21st century too damn much to ask?"

I almost could not find this at all!

[V],80zforever,2009-03-19T19:28Z,"JimmyTheWave, the man with no uploads whatsoever, gives advice on br. Why don't you rip your CD 320 k and upload it? "
,JimmyTheWave,2009-07-13T21:50Z,"Why not just say you didn't rip this one, instead of taking it personal?"
,[NTT],2009-08-19T20:58Z,"JimmyTheWave , Why not put energy into looking at yourself instead of projecting your unresolved issues onto others.  When you use language like that which you chose to use, it is offensive and makes thing personal.

80z showed you more grace than most would, yet you still sling your shtuf."
