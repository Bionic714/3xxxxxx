,s.k0v4cs,2007-12-25T13:09Z,"Hi, thanks for uploading this! Can you please start uploading the episodes you mentioned from the third season? (I'm also seeding this and season 1 right now and I'd also seed those episodes for some time as I can.)

I'm new here and I'd have a question that I haven't found the answer to in the forums yet. I have episodes 1, 3, 4-7, 9, 10, 18 (and episode 12 by 98.5%, but it can be played), but I downloaded the torrent from somewhere else, and I haven't seen their torrents here except for episodes 3 and 4. Is it appropriate to upload these torrents to this site? (I read somewhere that somone was told off because of uploading someone else's torrents - I don't wanna pretend they were my torrents just thought it may be worth making them available on the site.)"
,s.k0v4cs,2007-12-25T13:09Z,"Sorry, forgot to say, although seems to be obvious, that those episodes I mentioned are from season 3."
,s.k0v4cs,2007-12-29T23:10Z,"I've uploaded episodes 1-16 from season 3. (http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3952938/The_Suite_Life_of_Zack_and_Cody_S3_1-16)
Please seed after you download."
,Headstrongelle,2008-01-21T14:32Z,"Is this still have a Logo ""www.suitelifefans.com"" as a sub. in some episodes?"
,Headstrongelle,2008-01-21T14:37Z,waiting 4 the future DVD! Thank u 4 sharing!
,mikep666,2008-04-10T11:44Z,"has anyone else noticed alot of them are out of sync, like Hecks Kitchen, French 101, Daycare and many more? does anyone kow whatging on here?

plz help"
,mikep666,2008-04-10T11:45Z,"i'll redownload it, and see if its in sync then..."
,dejanolan,2008-04-15T21:28Z,"@mike - did the episodes resync after you downloaded them again?

,mikep666,2008-04-16T18:55Z,"nope not in sync, very dissapointed i love this show, dejanolan when your download has finished could you let me know if your are in sync, many thanks

mikey"
,mikep666,2008-04-18T12:39Z,"the reason knowone wants to seed is because most of the people who get the file get it out of sync, like me"
,s.k0v4cs,2008-04-19T07:49Z,"Sorry for the dumb question... what do you mean by out of sync? Do you mean that the voice is not in sync with the picture? I checked now French 101, Daycare and Heck's Kitchen on my copy at a couple of places at it seemed to be in sync for me in this sense. I can re-upload and seed for some time in case there's a problem with the current version that is being seeded..."
,s.k0v4cs,2008-04-19T20:14Z,"I've re-downloaded those three episodes (French 101, Daycare, Heck's Kitchen) and they seemed to be ok to me. (I checked them at a couple of places and the voice didn't seem to be out of sync.)"
[T],franXter,2008-05-08T23:21Z,I've watched every singel episode and i've not had any problem big enough for me to remember.
,kabalizo,2008-10-31T21:52Z,Thanks... my kids will really love this.
,alibabafreak999,2008-12-12T16:30Z,"mikep666, its your pc. i got the same problem one one of my old xp computers. but now it works fine with Windows Vista. my newer computer."
,Peti8171,2010-11-19T01:01Z,"Hi. It's very slow. There are 13-17 seeds connetced, but it comes only with 24-32 kB/s, and says, that the remaning time is 4-7 days. I'm new in torrent, so I don't know, if I had to keep switched on the computer while the whole download, or it can be continued if I switch off the computer?"
