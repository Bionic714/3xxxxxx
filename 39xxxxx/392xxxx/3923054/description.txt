Overlords of the UFO

Unbelievably bad 1970s UFO documentary.  Produced on little budget and even less thought, this film will induce more laughter than any other pseudo-science documentary ever produced.  The highlight is the proposed connection between UFO contact and the Mormon religion.  Yes, it appears that Mormonism is just Scientology without the celebrities! ;)
