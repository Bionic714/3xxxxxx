Enjoy!

I am happy to share all my collection with you!

I very much appreciate all the efforts that you are deploying to keep the Fu alive by seeding these torrents, whenever possible and with the means that you have at your disposal, and I sincerely thank you all.

Together, let's keep the Fu alive, REGARDLESS OF THE CARYING BOAT!

If you happen to be an active seeder, please drop your hotmail email address so that other Fu Members could contact you for a possible reseed.

,JamesKees,2008-01-04T19:16Z,"Guys/Gals,

Happy new year to you and yours!

I have reached and exceeded the limits of my seeding capabilities, burning my PC's CPU in the process due to overheating, and I cannot remain effective in uploading and seeding simultaneously anymore.
Rest assure, the Fu will remain alive. From today onwards, I will keep posting new releases via a new referral, with direct download, at: 
http://www.fuflixbulletin.net/bulletin/

The remaining of today's releases are also available via the above referral.

We hope that you will come and visit us soon."

Only progra that whould open it stated that it was a .(.) file, and still wouldn't play it."
