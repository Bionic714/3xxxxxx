,ifihadtime,2007-12-15T14:53Z,"this is not the full version, any chance of  getting the full version ?"
,metal_head81,2008-01-06T20:54Z,"screw this.if this is just a trial im not wasting my time on this crap,and besides,i doubt it works along with all the other software out there that claims to mask your identity"
,piratehaven,2008-03-31T22:01Z,"not working...

i have a keygen for this from another site which generates your 'options.ini' file for you. But even that doesn't work! So don't bother..

If you want something free that does the same (ok it's a bit slower) there's a program called JonDo by JAP."
,unique_,2008-04-24T06:35Z,I have tried everything to install with .ini file but just don't get it. Would really like some help if poss. Thanx
,David951Riverside,2009-01-21T06:57Z,"PSHAW personally i installed this withouth the instructions and i still got it right i just had to get the info, works perfectlly fine for me so yeah......"

,testament707,2009-04-21T12:27Z,"btw u need to copy file called ""options.ini"" to folder were u instaled program and replace the old one

,ScoRud,2009-08-08T09:21Z,"Thanks alot for this app, its just a bit of a shame it doesn't actually mask your ip, my friend managed to ping me easy enough and went on a ip site which pin pointed me to exactly where i was. I havent actually seen any good feedback for any ip masking programs either. Crack works great and everything else just its main function doesn't."
,Ghosted92,2009-08-13T04:35Z,Why am I being asked for a password to extract the file?
,mrmnga,2012-05-31T15:03Z,"thanks dude
