Invisible IP Map is user-friendly software that masks your real location. Every computer that is connected to the Internet has its own IP address which could easily be located on a map. This program will help you show yourself like you are surfing from another place on the planet.

This is a Mask IP software which is used to change your real Internet address while browsing. The software will deliver you fresh anonymous proxy servers every time you decide to click on "Get IP Locations". The main benefit of this software is that you can't be traced when browsing websites. Also if a website is restricted for users from specified country the program can bypass that protection. By hiding your IP you will prevent receiving spam from marketers which know your interests by tracking your IP when browsing websites. You can use web based e-mail to send anonymous e-mail. Post on bulletin boards without displaying your real IP address.
