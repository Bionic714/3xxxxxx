This torrent includes 4 albums of Chanukah-themed music, mostly traditional but some songs geared for kids, in English, Hebrew, Yiddish, and even Ladino/Spanish.  There are also some songs for other Jewish holidays like Passover and Rosh Hashanah.

I have also included some extra documents, like a how-to guide for Chanukah, some PDF coloring sheets for kids, printable song lyrics, & more.

Please help keep these songs & traditions alive by continuing to seed this torrent!

Hope you enjoy!!!

Happy Chanukah & Chag Sameach!





PS - Some of these were released as torrents a long time ago, but I have completed and corrected all the tags (some were completely wrong) and added album art so that the music can be added seamlessly to your library without any extra editing of tags on your part.
