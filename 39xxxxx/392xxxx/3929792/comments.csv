,JSLau2008,2008-07-08T06:50Z,"I don't know what anyone of you did, but thank you. You have got the torrent out of the ""queued"" status and is now downloading. "
,ntixitjo,2008-12-14T02:57Z,"thank you uploader. unfortunately this video is ridiculously small. the resolution is a paltry 352x288 (that 4:3, plus it's forced widescreen so it's actually even smaller than it sounds.) definitely does not merit 1.26 GB."
,thuerrsch,2008-12-27T12:34Z,This rip consists mainly of the black stripes above and below the image. Someone needs of a liiiittle more experience here. Do not download.
