Carter (Amanda Tapping), Tealâ??c (Christopher Judge) and Jonas (Corin Nemec) 
are sent to a small town on the Oregon coast to search for missing research 
scientist Richard Flemming. After the three find a partially constructed alien 
ship in one of the buildings, Carter discovers that the zombie-like townspeople 
are actually Gouâ??ald. We learn that Immunitech is implanting Gouâ??ald symbiotes

antibiotic allows her to play along until NID special operations forces arrive.

Original air date: July 19, 2002 
Oâ??Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) flees a Jaffa attack on an unknown planet but 
is captured alongside a slave before reaching the Stargate. Imprisoned and 
tortured by Baâ??al the System Lord, Oâ??Neill loses his memory and cannot remember 
where he is or why he is there. The specter of Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks), 
who has been elevated to another plane of existence in death, appears in 
Oâ??Neillâ??s prison cell and offers the mystical wisdom of Oma. Since SG-1 lacks 
the firepower to attack Baâ??alâ??s fortress, Tealâ??c (Christopher Judge) suggests 
recruiting one of the other system lords to attack it. Oâ??Neill and the slave 
escape together as Daniel appears one last time to tell him â??Youâ??re going to 
e all right.â??

Episode 07 - Shadowplay

Original air date: July 26, 2002 
SG-1 receives a delegation from Kelowna, a country on Jonas' home planet. The 
leader of the delegation tells SG-1 that peace on his planet is being threatened 
by a non-aggression pact between two rival powers. The Kelownans offer to trade 
naquadria for some of Earth's superior military technology. Without it, the 
Kelownans say they will be forced to unleash the awesome destructive power of 
their newly developed naquadria bomb. Dr. Kieran, a Kelownan scientist who worked 
on the bomb, tells Jonas he's part of a resistance movement bent on saving the 
planet from destruction. Jonas tell Hammond a coup is afoot and the Pentagon sends 
SG-1 to negotiate with the Kelownan government. It's an emotional homecoming for 
Jonas, who is still seen as a traitor by some of his countrymen. While Dr. 
Kieran arranges a meeting between SG-1 and the leaders of the resistance, 
Kelownan First Minister Valis tells Jonas that Kieran has been acting strangely
 and asks him to spy on the doctor. On the way back to resistance headquarters, 
Kelownan guards open fire on Jonas and Kieran chasing them into a warehouse. Jonas 
drives them off with cover fire, but Kieran falls off a catwalk and is knocked 
unconscious. The Kelownans deny attacking Kieran as a rebel spy. Carter uses a 
special device to track Kieran's smuggled naquadria to resistance headquarters. 
They find naquadria, but the building is otherwise deserted. Brain scans reveal 
that Kieran is suffering from advanced schizophrenia caused by prolonged exposure 
to naquadria. The team realizes that the resistance was a fantasy that existed 
only created in Kieran's deteriorating mind. The Kelownan bomb project turns 
out to be flawed technology and SG-1 returns home with a large quantity of 
naquadria, leaving Jonas' troubled homeland to fight its battles alone.

Episode 08 - The Other Guy

Original air date: August 2, 2002 
Professors Coombs, Meyers and Felger are examining the ruins of a gou'ald temple 
on an unfriendly planet. O'Neill and Teal'c, who are standing guard, leave to 
join Carter and Jonas, who are a short distance testing equipment near the 
stargate. Gou'ald attack vessels suddenly swoop down and capture the team, but 
instead of following O'Neill's orders and heading back to stargate command, Felger 
decides to go after them. Meyers heads back to SGC and tells Hammond that 
Felger and Coombs have used the rings at the ruins to go up to the orbiting 
gou'ald mothership where SG-1 is being held captive. Felger and Coombs crawl 
through some ducts and find SG-1's holding cell. O'Neill is furious with them 
for disobeying orders. Carter reveals that their capture was faked to facilitate 
a meeting with Khonsu, a high-ranking gou'ald who is actually an undercover 
Tok'ra. Felger and Coombs take cover behind some piled-up containers, but realize 
something is amiss when two jaffa are gunned down nearby. Her'ak, who is supposed 
to deliver SG-1, instead pens them inside a force field and sets off to kill 
Khonsu. Felger and Coombs travel to Khonsu's planet, sneak inside the pyramid 
and witness the killing. The two wayward scientists access the pyramid control 
room and contact the team on a gou'ald PA system. With Carter's help, they 
unlock a stash of weapons. Felger delivers the guns, while Coombs works on 
shutting off the force field. SG-1 and Felger escape and attack the jaffa 
who are guarding the stargate, but Coombs gets trapped inside the control 
room, forcing Teal'c and O'Neill to ring back inside and rescue him. Back 
at SGC, Felger and Coombs receive special medals of honour for their bravery.
