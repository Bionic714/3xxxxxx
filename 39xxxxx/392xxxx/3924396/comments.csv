Yes indeed, if you try to keep it within 700MB, it's inevitable that you must sacrifice some of the quality. And almost three hours usually is far more than you should try to squeeze into 700MB, but I gave it a try anyway. :)"
,deb_ind,2008-04-08T19:55Z,"Baloo2..its the best available complete movie in 700mb. u have done a great job mate.see now the number of seeders is so high..thats a great achievement. can u please provide the english subtitle also, as few of my friends arent good at english.. if u have got eng subtitle..upload it somewhere and pls give me the link..cheers"

,Mr.Bomb,2009-06-09T10:26Z,"i downloaded and compared this torrent with another one which contains 2 cds.

i still cant understand how you could compress a 3 hours movie to 700mb only, but it is really good.
a: 8/10
v: 8/10

the other torrent with 2 cds has slightly higher quality, but if you dont pay any extra attention for it, you  will not sense the difference. considering the file size, if this is not your all-time favourite movie, go for this 700mb version.
by the way swedish subs are NOT hardcoded. you can remove the subtitle file from the folder.

thanks to the uploader  :) "
