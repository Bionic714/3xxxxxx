,DeadGame,2007-12-13T13:56Z,"Davy Rothbart?s surprisingly moving and intimate punk rock documentary ?How We Survive? forms the heart of this DVD from Geffen Records. Davy, along with fellow filmmakers David Meiklejohn and Rachel Dengiz, followed Rise Against for two weeks on the 2006 Warped Tour. In each city, the filmmakers chose a fan from the crowd and spent the next day documenting their lives. ?How We Survive? weaves together the stories of the band members, their families, and their fans to powerful effect."

As for the seeding, I've been trying as much as possible, and I'll continue to seed for an indefinite amount of time. The internet where I'm at is pretty slow and pretty unreliable, so I apologize if anyone's having problems. Hang in there on this one. It's definitely worth it."
