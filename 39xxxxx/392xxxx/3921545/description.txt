Curvemeister v3.0.1a retail - Photoshop plugin [From F.O.S.I]

The Curves command in Photoshop is vital for getting the tones and
colour balance of your images right. Curvemeister gives you a much
improved interface, allowing you to look at all of the channel
curves for an image at the same time, as well as giving a more
precise view of each on there own. It also gives a clear display
of the histogram and improved mouse control over changing the
curve shape.

Read .nfo file for serial no.

Works great with Photoshop CS3.
