,murkk,2008-04-04T02:11Z,19derak59: The serial is in the .nfo file inside the downloaded zip. Use a text editor to read it.

,murkk,2009-02-23T19:42Z,@Sky110 - the instructions are clear enough - LOOK IN THE .NFO file! You're quoting from the .diz (description) file which does not contain the serial.
,robbers,2010-01-25T15:33Z,"umm, i can dl a demo from the website (which i'm assuming will promote to a full version with said serial), so, ahh ...
