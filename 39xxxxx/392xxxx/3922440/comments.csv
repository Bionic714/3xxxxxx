,Earcandy,2008-01-12T14:53Z,I've uploaded 2 gig of this torrent with a ratio of 8.  why is everyone hitting and running? It's the same with my other goose creek torrent. I uploaded 2 gig also.
,Earcandy,2008-01-12T20:59Z,"i will create one more seed and then will delete the torrent. I've learned my lesson. If a person uploads an obscure artist that only a handful of people want, and with the ratio of hit and runs, there are no seeders left. I have seen the seeds disappear before my very eyes while uploading. It's a shame. I have 4 more of GCS's cd's and many other 'obsure' artists, but it would be a waste of my time and upload bandwidth [my ips has an u/l and d/l cap limit]. I'm not married to my uploaded torrents and WANT TO FREAKIN' SEED OTHER TORRENTS THAT I HAVE D/L. Both of my Goose Creek uploads are queued seeds right now until they each create another seed."
