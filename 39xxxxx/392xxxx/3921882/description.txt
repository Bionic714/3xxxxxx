I present to you today, ladies and gentlemen, an oddity, come from strange parts of the world! Can you hear the music slowly twisting backwards and into itself? When you close your eyes, can you hear this strange sonata distorting time?
Dear reader, imagine for a moment that there are no seconds, no minutes, and no hours. There is only now, and what you make of it.
So listen, dear reader.
