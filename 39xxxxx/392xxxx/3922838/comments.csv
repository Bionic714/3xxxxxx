If you guys can keep it going, that'd be awesome. But if not, I'm sorry. I've done all I can. And If the torrent doesn't last, then I'll probably just delete it so there one less dead torrent floating around getting someones hopes up.
But if ever someone needs and extra seed just let me know and I'll see what I can do."
