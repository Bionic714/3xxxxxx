Starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. An English anthropologist (Christopher Lee) has uncovered the remains of a monster in the frozen wastes of Manchuria. He brings the creature back to Europe aboard a trans-Siberian express, but during the trip the monster thaws out and starts to kill the passengers. Horror Express also stars Telly `Kojak' Savalas. It is a shame that his screentime is so short, but he definitely makes the of his performance.
