-=AMG Review=- by Stephen Thomas Erlewine

One of many CD/DVD packages released in 2007, Way Back Home: Live from New York City could have been recorded anywhere on the Wreckers tour, but it was recorded on a stop in the Big Apple where they played through 13 songs, almost all pulled from their lone studio album, but also including three new tunes. The duo sounds good Ã¢?? they're clean, tight, professional, not deviating much from the recorded versions but not doing much unexpected either. In other words, it's precisely the kind of live set that is of considerable interest to hardcore fans but not many other kinds of listeners. Those fans should be satisfied though, as this contains the complete concert on both the CD and DVD, unlike some similar packages which truncate the CD portion of the show.
