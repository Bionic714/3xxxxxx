Some pictures and videos of Wiggin Works model Leeann at her birthday party. The time stamp on the pics is wrong, these were taken 12/08/07.

All pics are of Leeann and one includes her best friend Leanna. One video is of Leeann singing Hit Me With Your Best Shot by Pat Benatar and the second is Leeann and Leanna singing You Are the Music in Me (I don't know the original artist).

Wiggin Works does not currently have a web presence and may never have one but then again I'm more interested in getting my models into the career they want and not parading them around in front of the entire world.
