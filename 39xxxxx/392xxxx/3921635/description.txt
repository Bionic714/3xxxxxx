From one review on Amazon:

One of the Most Enjoyable Albums of the Year, May 12, 2005 
By  Stephen Silberman "writer, Wired Magazine" (SF, CA USA)
    
This is what "jam band" music should be and almost never is: collaborative music that is both tight and exploratory, impressively fresh in its palette of sounds yet full of the traditional jazz values of empathy and swing. Don't be put off by the marketing of this album as "deep trance groove" -- this is not another yawn-worthy electronic/world-beat hybrid with tablas sitting in for a drum machine, but a true meeting of Eastern and Western sensibilities boasting melodies that you can't get out of your head. Fans of everyone from Miles Davis to the Grateful Dead to "Mwandishi"-era Herbie Hancock should give this a listen -- it might be just what you're waiting for.
