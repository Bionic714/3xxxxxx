,nexia,2007-12-09T23:00Z,"call me moron, but there is no trial version of iLife 08 ..."
,lenny491,2007-12-09T23:48Z,nexia: He probably mistook iLife for iWork.
,sundazed,2007-12-10T17:39Z,"Yes, that's a serial for iWork '08"
,nexia,2007-12-10T18:50Z,"YOGI, calm down... the guy is seeding, but there is not much to powerseed, nobody received the entire archive yet...

If you are so stressed about having iLife, the only thing you can do is going at Apple.com and BUY THE DAMN SOFTWARE...  so shut up"
,fasttap,2007-12-11T20:03Z,"my mistake, it was iworks' serial"
,nexia,2007-12-12T03:54Z,"@fasttap, i really appreciate that you answer back.. this is rare to see people be brave that way... usually, people who errors are always complaining, but you, you act like a mature person... graces to you!"
