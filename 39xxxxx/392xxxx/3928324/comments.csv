,VonDude007,2007-12-11T02:52Z,"scan the pk3 idiot.  There are NO executables, only graphics and definition files for the game.  You searched for this for a reason, but YOU NEVER DOWNLOADED IT.  If you are unsure, and you should be.  Never trust anything from the internet.  SCAN IT and you'll see There are no viruses.

Oh, my friend told me that F1 is the button to use for NO FOG (fyi)"

,lsenem,2008-01-09T21:45Z,"VonDude is correct, check your files before opening/installing them.

By the way there is no AimBot in this file...there are no AimBots for MoH...they don't exist.

There are wall hacks, auto-fire, door hacks, cham skins...but NO Aimbots."
