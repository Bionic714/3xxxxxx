R-2000 The Better Built House Home.  TV Series made in 1987 about every aspect of building an energy efficient home.  

This is Programs 1 to 4 on one DVD.

A 20 Program series plus a promotional video.  Produced by TVOntario and The Ministry of Energy 1987.  Very good information and is extremely hard to find as the R-2000 program has been sold to a private company and is being marketed all over the world.

There is a book available sold by the Canadian Home Builders Association Builders Manual that accompanies these building techniques.

For a 30 year old video it shows products that are still hard to find today, especially here in Canada.

Get it while you can!

I will upload the next DVD once this one is seeded.
