Not all of it is recent, but it is all from 2007. The Cowboy Junkies song is from their latest album Trinity Revisited, so that's "new" as well.

I wanted to include the song: "Frankly, Mr. Shankly" by The Smiths but it's not very recent so I skipped it. Maybe as a filler some other time.
Have fun and check out Mr. Shankly.
