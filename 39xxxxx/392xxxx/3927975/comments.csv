Could u kindly seed again. Or maybe even just email me this Slaine file direct. I'll provide the FTP account for big file transfers if agreeable & email others with it too if they request it. 

This also goes out to anyone out there who HAS dloaed this file. Post here if agreeable to emailing it direct. Thx all!  "

Maybe u'd consider transfering direct to me, Delahodge? Then, I can take up seeding duties too... 

If u'r cool wid it,  I'll provide the File Transfer account.... lemme know, bud!"

Sigh, I wonder why this happens. All other dloads work perfectly fine. In fact, just got a 115.9 mb Slaine torrent frm user 'Killawife' in fact.

Dloaded fine without a hitch. I use Ares btw."

,lobo_eire,2008-11-25T23:19Z,"What's the story with that enormous description listing all the Slaine comics? I thought it was a contents list and that they were all in this torrent, but unfortunately there are some missing.
I was particularly interested in TimeKillers :(

Anyway, great torrent but just a somewhat misleading description."
