Dvd elr vanlig 700mb skiva ?

PS. detta är den första versionen jag ladda hem.."
,broder_o,2007-12-25T21:39Z,"Thanks GasGiver! The best XBOX-dash from the best XBMC-releaser!

XBMC-scripts did not work for me in this release. It worked back on the May 8th-release that I upgraded from. Copying the contents of XBMCscripts from the old release to the new fixed it.
You know, I gotta have my dose of SVT when abroad!

GasGiver, keep up the good work!
I have given up trying other releases of XBMC than yours, guess I am getting lazy!"
,unrar,2008-01-20T21:24Z,better than new version. tried it out and it can't see my network. stick with this version.
