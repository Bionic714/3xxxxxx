,Slaven152,2008-12-09T20:46Z,"Thanks for the upload. Though I am having an issue. It took some trying to get it to Install, but my problem occurs opening the Interface... Theres 3 options and its written in Gibberish. The first doesn't do anything, the 2nd is the Options for Resolution and such, and the 3rd is Exit... So I am not sure why its not loading. But I am sure I will figure it out and post it here since I can see I am not alone with this issue, Lol. If someone else has this issue and has a solution, perhaps you can pass the info along for those who encounters this problem as well? Thanks in advance."

,Duker89,2008-12-21T11:57Z,"I managed to install it by going directly into the setup file on the disc and run the Windows Installer package. This will bypass whatever error appears when trying to install it the  normal way, BUT when trying to play it it basicly says ""You're not japanese, you can't play"" "
,mgdeath02,2009-05-28T18:41Z,"I cant believe I DL this game.... After playing it for about 1 hr I got bored easily.. Man The story sucks the scenes are  all the same except you can change the girls... Wooo.. Graphics are really great. I guess ILLUSION always cr8s games with no story value.. But man the graphics Really rock... Its like anime with a 3d value..

Cool... "
