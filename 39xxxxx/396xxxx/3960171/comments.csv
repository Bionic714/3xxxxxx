,prasnto,2008-04-05T07:07Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074621/ 

This is the 1976 film, not the 2004 film docu of the same name (just in case ppl were confuseled)."
,prasnto,2008-04-06T23:17Z,"Also, for future reference: there's no need to RAR the movie before making a torrent. 

Thought for people who don't want to keep an extracted and a rared copy, use Dziobas RAR Player to play the AVIs from inside the rar: http://ds6.ovh.org/

And what the fuck was the point of making the last 3 minutes of the film a separate file?"
