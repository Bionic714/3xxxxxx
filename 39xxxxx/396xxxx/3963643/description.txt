Witchcult Today is the sixth album by the doom metal band Electric Wizard. It was recorded entirely on vintage 1970s equipment at Toe Rag Studios, and was released in November 2007. Witchcult Today was less abrasive than preceding albums and Jus Oborn's vocals are much more prominent. It was the band's most well-received album in seven years.

The band's fascination with horror movies and writers continues here with "Satanic Rites of Drugula," a reference to the Hammer Studios horror film The Satanic Rites of Dracula, and "Dunwich," a reference to H.P. Lovecraft's short story The Dunwich Horror.
