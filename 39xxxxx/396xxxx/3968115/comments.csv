,kakifej2b,2008-01-14T12:38Z,why did u upload it if u dont want to seed it?
,stateofdreaming,2008-01-14T16:48Z,"exactly. Why bother if you're just gonna split? Fucking people on TPB, wtf. Dimwit. Do you think everyone here get's free bandwidth?"
,stateofdreaming,2008-01-14T16:55Z,"And after looking at your other torrents you still haven't fully upped yet, why the hell would you up another? Seems you have an issue with dumping torrents in the middle of seeding and not testing your torrents first either. As you suggested, maybe you should leave this to someone who knows WTF they're doing."

,Emplehod,2008-01-16T01:23Z,"What am I expected to do?  Upload a 7.8-Gig file 53 times?  I have uploaded over 16-Gigs in another torrent and I'm still the only one seeding.  Other people should seed too.

I explained why I stopped the DVD9 Blade Runner, because it wasn't good.  Should I keep a file seeding I know is bad and waste more people's time or take it off?  All I can do is apologize for it.

I told you before I didn't know it would take a fuking month to upload a torrent, otherwise I wouldn't have started two. Get a pisssy attitude and I can always just delete them all."
,Emplehod,2008-01-16T01:28Z,"Hell, I've got a 1.835 ratio.  I think that's pretty damn good.

stateofdreaming & kakifej2b: Neither of you have contributed anything.

gs_11_49: Maybe you should stop visiting porn sites.  There is any virus or spyware in my uploads."
,Emplehod,2008-01-16T01:37Z,stateofdreaming: And you think I have free bandwidth?  I bought the freakin' DVD myself and I'm sharing it for free. Why don't you go buy one and upload it? Dimwit.  I'll put my IQ up against yours anytime.
,Emplehod,2008-01-16T01:39Z,And don't forget:  Seeding bandwidth costs six times more than leeching bandwidth.  3000 down VS 512 up.
,sanjuro_61,2008-01-16T01:50Z,"Man, NO ONE has completed it, so NO ONE could seed it. We are all stuck at 57.9%

Be patience. Many people will seed this one when completed (and yes, others will run away...)"
,Emplehod,2008-01-16T03:21Z,"I was talking about another torrent.

That's okay, I'm seeding now and can't use my Internet because of it.  Thanks to the ""warm"" reception I've had here at TPB, I will not upload anymore of the 200+ DVDs I own.  I'll just leech like most of the complainers."
,sanjuro_61,2008-01-16T11:54Z,"You can't connect to the Internet? That's strange. I have uploaded some movies and never had problems with my connection.

BTW, it takes to me about three-four weeks (24/7) to upload a complete movie (about 7GB). You uploaded this one week ago, and without been seeding all the time we are at 65.4% now.
All I can say is: I wish I had your connection."
,Emplehod,2008-01-16T15:18Z,"Thanks, sanjuro.  My other torrent finished so this one should go much faster now.  I tried to explain that I was new to this and didn't quite understand how it worked, but I got my ass chewed out anyway, even after apologizing for my mistakes. And idiots claiming viruses and spyware in an exact clone that contains no executables is just too much.  Afraid I can't contribute anymore after this one.

Actually, my connection was supposed to be a lot better, but AT@T screwed me on my service, promised me package and then didn't come through."
,gs_11_49,2008-01-16T21:16Z,"I resent your implication that I've been visiting porno sites. 

And I can tell that the viruses and spyware I've been getting are not in the movie, but I assume they're coming with it, because they started when I started this download, and have now stopped since I stopped downloading it. 

I seriously doubt that is a coincedence and will never download another of your torrents again. 

Furthermore, all the problems you discuss could be prevented with correct settings, and any idiot can figure that out, so the obvious assumption is deliberate sabotage. "
,Emplehod,2008-01-16T23:37Z,"gs_11_49:
And I resent your direct accusation that my files have viruses or spyware.  Just because YOU don't know how to keep your system protected does not mean I'm uploading viruses.

And explain to me how you could get a virus before you've downloaded something?  There is only one file in my torrent and it's an ISO, so how could that possible infect a system. Have I suddenly invented the world's first streaming virus?

Maybe you should take your computer back to Wal-Mart or Toys-R-Us and get a refund."
,Emplehod,2008-01-16T23:44Z,"Here's some helpful info:

""Almost all viruses are attached to an executable file, which means the virus may exist on your computer but it cannot infect your computer unless you run or open the malicious program. It is important to note that a virus cannot be spread without a human action, (such as running an infected program) to keep it going.""

So how did you load and run an image that you had no more than 50% of?"
,Emplehod,2008-01-16T23:50Z,"Oh yeah!  If someone were going to ""deliberately sabotage"" a torrent, do you think they'd put it in a 7.8 Gb file?  Wouldn't it make a lot more sense to put it in something small, like a utility maybe?

And quite frankly, I'm not going to lose any sleep over the fact that you won't leech my torrents again.  Ask anyone who's completed one of my torrents about the quality."
,gs_11_49,2008-01-17T00:05Z,"Quite to the contrary, I do know how to keep my system protected. The only thing I've let in lately is your torrent. 

There is absolutely no room for any doubt whatsoever that my problems came in with your torrent. 

Of course, I cannot be certain whether you or someone else is responsible for the various malware that came in with your torrent, which has a very high discard rate, by the way, so I assume that is probably how it is being done. 

But your slowness, unreliability, and offensive, arrogant attitude are quite sufficent in and of themselves to convince me that it would be extremely unwise to unload any of your torrents in the future.

If you are innocent of intentionally causing problems, why are you not being more cooperative in finding out what the problem is?

If you have nothing to hide, why are you so defensive?

You tried to make it sound like you're inexperienced, but your vocabulary shows otherwise, and reveals an undercurrent of dishonesty. 

At the very least, I expect that you will stop this upload before it is finished, and leave everyone hanging. "
,Emplehod,2008-01-17T15:20Z,"Do you have a mental deficiency? Don't you realize it isn't possible to get a virus from a half-completed torrent that contains only one (non-executable) file?

And for your info, there are 21 seeders now.  Leave everyone hanging?  I had nothing but the best of intentions, as it clearly shows in my original torrent.  It's whining jerks like you that make me go on the defensive.

I'm sure everyone that's tried this movie agrees it is of the utmost quality and contains no viruses.  Crawl back under your rock and stop trolling."
,gs_11_49,2008-01-17T19:00Z,"If you were to actually read your own quotation above, the part where it says ""almost all viruses"" you might begin to realize that you are beating a dead horse. An increasing number of viruses do indeed come in other forms besides executable files. 

And as anyone can see from what is written above I simply enquired if others were getting viruses, wondering if it were perhaps a coincedence that I started getting viruses at exactly the time I began your download. 

But when you began to insult and attack me in a manner that strongly suggests either intense defensiveness or anti-social personality disorder it became obvious you have something to hide, but that could be nothing more than your personality, which is obviously not much."
,Howl4Me,2008-01-17T23:12Z,Just wanted to say thanks for finishing the upload. Can replace my non-anamorphic Criterion disc with this.
,Emplehod,2008-01-18T01:29Z,"gs_11_49:

Holy cow!  For someone who claims not to want to download my torrents, you sure spend a lot of time here!

To set you straight on some technical things:

Let's say for argument's sake that you could somehow get a virus in the middle of a download and by some strange turn of events, it would actually propagate BEFORE you were able to open anything.  Do you really believe that the virus would disappear merely by stopping the download?  They would remain on your system until you took some action to remove them.

And as for insults, you are the one who starting the mudslinging.  I quote your first comment:

""I've had lots of spyware and several viruses in my computer after I started downloading this.""

Can somebody who has finished this download back me up here?  Run a virus check on the file. Did you find any virus?  How is the quality of the movie?

I think you'll find that my uploads are among the highest quality on here.  Yes, the torrent took a while to upload.  I have already explained why I paused it to finish another I had begun, not realizing how long they'd take.  In the header I also explained that I discovered the first burn didn't play well, due to an encryption error.  IF I were some malcontent, why wouldn't I just leave the bad one on here and not apologize for it? Dufus!

Perhaps you need psychiatric help. I'm sure if you Google ""disturbed Internet troll"" you could find some help.

Howl4me:

Dude, you are very welcome and I'm sorry it was so long coming.  If I upload anymore, I will surely do only one at a time.  But I will not upload anything unless people request it.  After all, I wouldn't want to give anyone else a virus :)"
,gs_11_49,2008-01-18T03:32Z,"The various malware did not disappear by themselves. I run spyware and virus programs daily. That is how I know they came in during the same 24 hour period as I started your torrent. 

At first I was prepared to believe the timing may have been a coincedence. It was only after you became so belligerent that I decided you were anti-social enough to be responsible.

The reason I have carried this conversation on so long was simply to provide others with the opportunity to see for themselves what you are like, so they can make up their own mind whether they want your uploads or not.

That has been accomplished now, and you have turned out to be very boring and childish so I quit. "
,DrRichardKimble,2008-01-18T06:25Z,"@ Emplehod: First of all, many thanks for taking the time and effort to try and share with the community.  I particularly like your taste in movies and it's nice to see full DVD options out there, including commentary tracks, etc.
Second, it's best to ignore obvious trolls like gs_11_49, though I understand your desire to set the record straight.  Still, there's no winning an argument with somebody who won't listen to reason.  And most educated users understand that it is retarded to think that a virus could propagate itself as he/she describes so the community can sort this kind of stuff out.

I for one hope you don't give up on sharing your awesome collection with the community.  There are a few things that might help make the process less painful for you (and everybody else):

Most important, when creating your torrent, don't leave the torrent piece size set on automatic for large torrents.  It will automatically create large pieces (in this case, 4MB each).  This makes it very difficult for the tracker to maintain decent speeds, even when both uploader and downloaders have decent bandwidth.  Here's a great piece of info from the BitTorrent wiki on this subject: 

The piece length specifies the nominal piece size, and is usually a power of 2. The piece size is typically chosen based on the total amount of file data in the torrent, constrained by the fact that piece sizes too large cause inefficiency, and too small a piece size will result in a large .torrent metadata file. The conventional wisdom used to be to pick the smallest piece size that results in a .torrent file no greater than approx. 50 - 75 kB (presumably to ease the load on the server hosting the torrent files). However, now that hosting storage and bandwidth are not tightly constrained, it is best to keep the piece size to 512KB or less, at least for torrents under 8-10GB or so, even if that results in a larger torrent file, in order to have a more efficient swarm for sharing files.

The second piece of advice I can offer is for when you first start seeding your torrent, choose the ""Super Seed"" option (also known as ""Initial Seeding"" in uTorrent).  That will help you keep your bandwidth usage under control.  However, there are pros and cons to Super Seeding so it's appreciated if you only use it when you first start seeding the torrent.  More info on Super Seeding can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_seed

I hope you find that information useful.  

And please don't let the trolls get you down -- there are plenty of people out here who appreciate your efforts."
,gs_11_49,2008-01-18T17:44Z,"Gosh, are you a real doctor? You must be so smart. 

But neither one of you clowns have dealt with the real problem here, the spyware. 

It seems that the problem here is simply one of definitions in that some people define Virtumonde as a virus, while others define it as spyware or Trojan. From my experience it seems to be both.

But whatever it is, I know where it came from -- and I suggest that anyone who has downloaded this torrent should get a scanning program capable of detecting Virtumonde (not all spyware programs do detect it), and scan their system.

I will stick with private trackers in the future. They're much safer.

Good luck to the rest of you."
,Howl4Me,2008-01-18T22:54Z,"Ok, I read some of that. Actually I only just skimmed it. A lot of what gs_11_49 says is just plain ridiculous.

The torrent for this is just one file. An .ISO file. Mounting the ISO file only shows the typical DVD directory structure (AUDIO_TS, VIDEO_TS folders). There is NO GODDAMN spyware or malware in this. ""gs_11_49"" is the quintessential troll, please ignore him."
,gs_11_49,2008-01-18T23:36Z,"One does not have to be a troll to figure out that there are powerful groups out there who will go to quite some length to interfere with those who download torrents. 

It is also not much of a stretch to assume that, especially on a public tracker, partisans of those groups are operating among us.

I've done my best to warn people about what seems to be going on here, and I have received nothing but abuse for my effort, which in my opinion supports my assumption. 

Also, I am very curious as to why this particular torrent had an unusually high rate of discarded data, but no hash fails. 

But now, I quit. I have come to my decision as to what to do here. The number of belligerant individuals who resorted to abuse rather than deal straight on with the questions I have raised have made the choice very clear for me. "
,DrRichardKimble,2008-01-19T07:35Z,"LOL, gs_11_49, you are quite the funny troll.  How many times do you have to say ""I quit"" before you actually do?  You're up to two so far...  will there be more?

If you knew anything about torrents, you'd realize that the reason you have so much discarded data but no hash fails is a direct result of the large piece size.  Discarded data is the result of getting bytes that you already have.  This is normal due to the nature of BitTorrent technology, but particularly common on torrents with large piece sizes.  I won't bore you with the technical reasons since you obviously don't have any understanding of how any of this stuff works and don't have the capacity to learn or understand any of it anyway.  Go ahead and adjust your tinfoil hat and continue trolling elsewhere (of course, we should be so lucky -- I suspect you won't be able to control yourself and will continue trolling this thread anyway)...

@Emplehod: I hope you don't let this idiot troll bring you down.  I'm sure more people than not appreciate your efforts, but it's the little bitches like gs_11_49 that whine the loudest and cause the most trouble for the community.
Having said that, please consider my advice in my previous post -- it really will make your (and everybody else's) torrent experience smoother."
