I have run this ISO from Daemon Tools and played it in VLC Player and it works great.  Sorry again for any inconvenience.  I am pretty new at this and wanted to make it right. So, without further ado, I give you:

A Terry Gilliam Film

Starring Jonathan Pryce, Robert De Niro, Katherine Helmond, Michael Palin.

"Pitting the imagination of common man Sam Lowry (the brilliantly befuddled Jonathan Pryce) against the oppressive storm troopers of the Ministry of Information, Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL has come to be regarded as an anti-totalitarian cautionary tale equal to those of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, and Kurt Vonnegut Jr. Gathering footage from both the European and American versions of this masterpiece, Gilliam has assembled the ultimate, 142-minute directorÃ¢??s cut of his most celebrated film."
