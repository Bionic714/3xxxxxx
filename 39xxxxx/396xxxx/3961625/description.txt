Mount ISO image in Daemon tools, or burn ISO image to CD with your prefered burning program
or extract ISO image to an empty folder, then run setup.exe.

(MAY OR MAY NOT BE NEEDED)--- After installation, go to the Daemon Tools virtual drive that 
the ISO image you mounted on and brouse to the Crack.exe folder and copy the Shadowman.exe
to the game installation directory. For some reason on {MY PC} the game will start without the ISO
image staying mounted in Daemon Tools with this Crack.exe method. On other PC's I tested, it will NOT, so 
this will vary. (((Maybe some of you will figure this out.)))

There are also patches for this game in case you run into freeze or crash problems.

Instructions for applying them are in the RAR file also located inside the Crack.exe
folder.

Hope you enjoy this forgotten classic. ;)
