                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neil Jordan's somber The Brave One is a lot of things. A reflective movie about 
a crime victim's sense of dislocation and isolation from her own life following 
a harrowing trauma, the film will strike a chord with a lot of people who have 
known violence. The Brave One is also a provocative drama about the nature of 
justice, a theme explored endlessly in American movies that typically find law 
enforcement wanting. In Jordan's film, however, the conflict between instinctive 
vigilantism and legal protocols is approached with more deliberateness and 
complexity than usual. Finally, despite its seriousness of purpose, The Brave 
One, to a certain extent, is drearily tethered to the old atrocity-and-revenge 
genre, bumping along to the familiar, Death Wish-like rhythms of an avenger 
seeking successive conflicts with bad guys he or she can blow away. 
Somewhat at cross-purposes, The Brave One stars Jodie Foster in a shattering 
performance as Erica Bain, a popular essayist on a public radio station in New 
York. In love and engaged to David (Naveen Andrews), a doctor, Erica and her 
fiancÃš are brutally attacked one night by a gang of thugs. David is killed but 
Erica survives, only to find herself a stranger in her own skin, facing down her 
fears by shooting violent criminals.

With the city riveted by her anonymous actions, Erica becomes an object of 
curiosity for a police detective (an excellent Terrence Howard) disillusioned by 
his own struggles to protect the innocent from truly evil men. Jordan's previous 
films (The Crying Game, Breakfast on Pluto) resonate with The Brave One's most 
interesting angle, i.e., that each of us possesses a hidden element in our 
identities that comes out in extreme circumstances, making us wonder who we 
really are. It's all excellent food for thought, but the film squanders much of 
its significance by thrusting Erica into numerous, outlandish situations in 
which her only alternative is to put a bullet in a bad guy.
