,masterbluestar,2008-01-10T02:09Z,Does it have serial?
,cpt_elektro,2008-01-10T09:43Z,It's version 1.5b4 (latest beta) and is pre-cracked. :) No serial needed.
,ava833,2008-01-10T21:22Z,"Thanks, MS Project can go back to the archives again :-)
Any chance for Omnigraffle 4.2 ? 
4.1 keeps crashing here :/ "
,kijulama,2008-01-11T03:27Z,"Just download the trial version, and then use this name and serial : 
macluvrRU
FVCW-WVKK-TQDF-RZBB-LGJC-OAD"
,hjoe,2008-01-11T07:38Z,"@kijulama:

That licence is for Omnigraffle..."
,ava833,2008-01-11T14:36Z,"Great stuff kijulama, thanks ! :-)"
,Apple_Master,2008-01-14T00:55Z,"Hey guys. thanks for these two! Any chance of Outliner also?

Thanks again!

,sundberg1,2008-01-16T10:09Z,"Dont work since jan 16, anyone have a serial?"
,Mata_Hari,2008-01-16T19:36Z,"Perfect stuff guys!
@ sundberg1:
Before installing Omniplan change system date to 1st January 2008. Then get an update immediately. Done!"
,Mata_Hari,2008-01-17T15:56Z,"Wuahhh:
As soon as I update the system-date it dosn't work  any more. The updated omniplan version doesn't work with kijulama's code (Omnigraffle!). Serial box 1-2008 doesn't have an active serial either!
Any suggestions..."
,nanoboy,2008-01-18T14:22Z,"Yeah i too have the same problem.  The changing system date workaround only works when your system is set before the 16thJan.  So no use for real date project management then....  :-(

Can't find serial anywhere...."
,scrapetorrent,2008-01-29T15:54Z,Says it's expired....
,schlossmann,2008-02-19T00:56Z,"Hello everybody!
Can somebody provide a torrent of the full version ""1.5 b5""?
I cant find it nowhere, looked for about two hours.
Thank you very much!"
,digdug,2008-05-09T17:53Z,"There's no point in downloading this one. It's a time-limited beta and (as has been mentioned above) doesn't work past Jan. 16th, 2008. And setting your date back to use this app totally defeats the point of using it."
,GoPool,2008-05-25T23:34Z,"Can someone point me in the direction of a torret for the full version of omnioutliner 3.6. I cannot seem to find it anywhere.

Thanks in advance!!"
,GoPool,2008-05-28T13:45Z,"Nevermind, found it."
,hspencer,2008-07-22T14:37Z,"Doesn't work for me. No chance to enter a serial, it's just expired."
,Arctic.Cat,2008-10-01T19:08Z,Version 1.6.1 is on... Who have this new version?
,ahhoi,2009-04-24T21:18Z,this beta version expired in 2008. not of any use.
