Best regards and thank again. :-)"
,ilpalazzzo,2008-02-12T00:04Z,"jimmybfan, where are you?? :-) Please, upload all seasons with this quality if you have."
,HarrySachz,2008-02-26T21:20Z,"I have never seen the episodes in such high quality anywhere on the web, this is truly amazing!!!!

jimmybfan, please, please, pretty please come back and upload the rest, I'm begging you! It doesn't even have to be authored DVD files, just the raw episode files will do, I am planning on making my own DVD collection anyway (which I would be happy to upload then)."
,ilpalazzzo,2008-02-27T01:20Z,"I agree with you, HarrySachz.

PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAASEEEE, jimmybfan, HELP US, please. :-)

Someone know email or msn from jimmybfan? maybe jimmybfan don't read this comments."
,HarrySachz,2008-02-28T23:27Z,"I'm so sick of only finding the same ol' crappy abc-family TV captures on the web in all sorts of shapes and forms....all are based on the same crappy source files (captured in mono and at low bitrates). Horrible! 

jimmybfan.....PLEASE!!!! "
,ilpalazzzo,2008-02-29T19:45Z,"Yes, HarrySanchz, i'm in the same, only abc-family or crappy based on the same source.

Help my, jimmybfan; you're my only hope. :-D"
,HarrySachz,2008-03-03T03:40Z,"Hit us with the next disc....jimmybfan, like NOW!"
,bubbacon760,2008-03-16T17:35Z,how do should I down load? I'm new @ this can some one help me? thank you!!
,gijsyo,2008-03-19T19:35Z,"Wonderful. Thank you very much jimmybfan, just what I was looking for :)"
,jimmybfan,2008-03-24T22:55Z,"The first disc of the second season has been posted here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4097588

Question: Do you guys like the DVD download or would it be better to convert to xvid and post?"
,WhtwaBBiT,2008-03-25T00:17Z,"""Do you guys like the DVD download or would it be better to convert to xvid and post?""

I would prefer avi files as it would save alot of bandwidth for people with slower connections :)"
,ilpalazzzo,2008-03-26T12:44Z,"THX! THX! thank you very much! AGAIN. :-)

Have you all seasons with this quality?

jimmybfan, I would prefer DVD's downloads. It's amazing quality compare to the others crappy source files (mono, low bitrates...)

Best regards and thank again, again. ;-)"
,jimmybfan,2008-03-26T17:03Z,"Yeah, I have all episodes in the same quality. I will try and post a new disc every 2-3 weeks. I am also working on converting them to avi and post for those who would like smaller downloads."
,ilpalazzzo,2008-03-26T17:18Z,"WOW! jimmybfan, amazing! Perfect! Impressive! :-D

Thx very much. ;-)"
,HarrySachz,2008-03-28T23:31Z,"jimmybfan: First off...I'm so glad you're back!  2nd...I think most people's preference would be to preserve the video quality as best as possible, therefore NOT convert them to a lower quality format, but leave them as mpeg (I assume that's the source format?). I have no problem with the files being a little larger but get them in the best quality possible. I hate to see them compressed as xvid and then have to convert them back to mpeg (for DVD authoring) and take a 2nd quality hit!! IMHO, either the raw mpeg source files (best option) or the DVD files (like S1). "
,dissociativeentity,2008-04-09T06:10Z,"Kudos for making this available. I've always been a huge fan of the show, and am glad to be able to see it again! Thanks!"
,jimmybfan,2008-04-16T03:36Z,Season 2 disc 2 is out here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4137258 sorry for the delay
,HarrySachz,2008-04-21T01:53Z,"you da man!! Keep em coming! Do you have all 6 seasons already authored? what's your approx. schedule for posting them? no rush here, but just wonderng ;-)  THX!!!"
,jimmybfan,2008-04-29T01:46Z,"Season 2 Disc 3 @ http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4162392

Season 3 disc 1 in 2 weeks"
,joms5,2008-05-05T07:08Z,"silly me i posted this question on the wrong torrent section by accident. So i will be sure and repeat it here just in case.

First off, kudos to you jimmybfan!! As a long time fan of the wonder years i've since gotten sick of watching the show in the crappy quality downloads i have and stumbled across your glorious versions. So thank you for giving this to us wonder years fans.

Second i would like to address one thing that i noticed with the pilot episode in particular. There seems to be many scenes that have been cut short in your version (the pilot episode is the only one i have compared) Was this due to the network or yourself? Also do you happen to know if it was only the first episode or subsequent episodes as well?

Third i am in the process of creating DVD covers for all six seasons of this glorious show (as well as a bonus disc i have decided to put together in my spare time) and was curious if i had your permission to post links to the covers on your comment section of the torrents so that other users could use them if need be?

Once again thanks so much and i look forward to your future uploads.

Take Care"
,jimmybfan,2008-05-14T04:30Z,"Season 3 disc 1 is out here http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4187214

joms5 - All missing scenes would be due to the network. I only cut the commercials and the end credits because they were only in about the bottom quarter of the screen and scrolled way too fast. Please feel free to post any related links here. Any artwork is very welcome."
,blondiesara4u,2008-05-16T23:32Z,Thank you Jimmy. I just found you and these wonderful torrents. I am trying to play catch up now. I hope some people can stay seeding on these older seasons. I will seed all 6 seasons once I have them. I just bought a 1 terabyte hard drive. Thanks again!
,EchoKilo,2008-05-27T06:26Z,"Help please!  How do I turn these files into a DVD that will play in a DVD player?  I have Nero burning software.  I tried the ""make a dvd playable disk"" function, but it wouldn't recognize some of the 11 files.  So I burned them to dvd using the ""make a data dvd"" function.  That worked, but it is not playable on a DVD player.  I have a temp email address for help.  Thank you!

,atb0826,2008-06-09T00:40Z,"Great upload! I completely prefer the bigger file size to maintain the quality. To all the current seeders, I just jumped on this so please stay awhile so I may finish. Thanks"
,atb0826,2008-06-10T08:48Z,"To all who are wondering how to play these files on your pc...

All you have to do is right click the file named ""VIDEO_TS.IFO"" & choose ""open with"". Then you can choose either Media player classic or VLC Player. Both of those will automatically show the dvd menus when using that method that way you can just choose what episode you would like to watch.

Hope this helps."

,Ericster88,2008-08-23T19:35Z,"Thanks a lot for uploading these seasons Jimmybfan!  I just found these torrents, so I'm behind right now.  I'll seed all of the torrents once I download them."
,Ericster88,2008-09-01T00:32Z,"I just finished downloading (I'm going to seed them), and wow!  People weren't kidding, the quality is very good, and for most episodes, I'm preferring ION's scene cuts to ABC-Family's.   Now anxiously waiting for Season 3 - Disc 2. :)"
,PacMan5000,2008-09-06T05:39Z,"So, is it still possible to get these?  I know I'm late to the party, but would really like an opportunity to see these in great picture quality.  But it doesn't look like anyone is seeding.

How many seeders do I need to guarantee a quality download?"
,frank_br,2008-10-27T06:12Z,"Hey people, please seed this one!!

Tears from Brazil! :D"
,Buddy17,2009-03-11T04:52Z,"It has taken me almost three days to download this season (still not done), and two days for S2D1, but honestly, this is COMPLETELY worth it. I really hope people can re-seed some of these older ones, as it's going to be hard to play catch up while downloading at ~10-15 kb/s"
,joms5,2009-04-22T09:20Z,"I said i would get my own artwork up here for you guys almost a year ago. Apologies for the lateness but school and other stuff got in the way.

This is in no way a replacement for the excellent artwork that jimmybfan has uploaded. This was just my rendition of what i would want on my DVD cases.

Enjoy!
