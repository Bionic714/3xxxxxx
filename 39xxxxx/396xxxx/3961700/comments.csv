,madasahatter,2008-01-05T02:01Z,Exactly the same size as the other torrent when its unpacked  and that wer`nt cracked...so i guess this aint....
,vEcToR_2007,2008-01-05T09:39Z,"PanDildo+madasshitter....

Look careful guys....this one is better then the previous one. Though it´s still a rip. We still miss funtionality in the ACE-tool and some manuals are missing. Apart from that  it´s complete....

Later"

,Yxin123,2008-01-18T18:05Z,"Some of the models work sometimes. Switch plane, switch back, and it just might work perfectly.
Thx for the up :)"
,FrigginCom,2008-01-19T13:28Z,"Firstly thanks for cracking this, i had the one for 2004 and if that is anything to go by it should be so much fun.
i have run into problems with this one, i think i am putting all the right things in the right place but when i start it there is no sound long story short, there is nothing there.
is there an installer somewhere that i have not seen? the ""ace"" configure tool does not do much except allow you to set the plane up, does not let you start fsx from there (sounds dumb i know). 
if there is any place i can look for full install instructions please could someone tell me where it is so i can get this friggin thing right.
thanks in advance."
,FrigginCom,2008-01-20T00:17Z,"yay, i got it to work......during the multi tries i managed to have to c130 files in the folder which played havoc with it.....

,yeoldecaptain,2008-02-23T02:25Z,"""this is only the C-130E? wheres the rest of them? ""

I answer to that -- the others were'nt released until 19-FEB.  The rest ARE out now, though, and I am sure a lot of us are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the complete ""Pro Pack"" here on TPB.
