UFO Secrets of WW11 German Flying Saucers (1991)

This old Australian underground video documentary gives some very strong evidence of the development and use of â??Electro Magnetic Flying Craftâ?? (or UFOâ??s) that were developed in World War 2 by the Nazis. 

In regards to this video please note the following:

1. This video is certainly NOT a Hollywood production, (it is the information that is important here, not the graphics or the special effects) and:

2. Yes the music used can be pretty â??tragicâ??, it was 1991, and if it annoys you please try to ignore it.

3. As it has been converted from an old video, although I have tried to have the highest quality that I can, can be a bit rough in places.

With oil and energy prices rising all the time, what a crime it is that this (plus many other â??free energyâ?? technologies), are still being suppressed from the general public as PROFITS are all that seem to matter.

For what happened after World War 2 with the Nazi disks and their developers, the following superb documentary by Chris Everard, called â??Secret Spaceâ??:

Although in my opinion, this documentary is a bit disappointing, (and contains a bit of disinformation in parts), it does have a good segment and some more evidence of where the disks were developed and tested:
