The standard version of MediaMonkey is free for personal use, however, 
the more advanced Gold version adds a range of functionality for more serious collectors. 
Some of the added features included with MediaMonkey Gold are:    

      

* File Monitor - Automatically updates the Library any time you modify, add, 
move, or delete a music file (within specified directories), saving you from doing so manually.    

* Custom Filters & Views - Allow you to set up subcollections of 
music (e.g. Kids Music, Classical Music, etc.) that have  

different columns, nodes, and playback rules.  


* Advanced AutoPlaylists - Allow you to define a playlist based on     

 almost any criteria. For example, if you wanted music for a    

 party, you could have an AutoPlaylist that includes 100 Songs in 

 which Bitrate>=128 Kbps, Tempo= fast/veryfast, Year=1990-2000, 

 Rating>=4 stars, Genre=Rock. Advanced AutoPlaylists are also   

 especially useful for synchronizing with a Portable device as  

 they allow you to quickly choose which subset of tracks to     

 synch.     

* Auto-Conversion - Converts tracks on-the-fly from an unsupported     

 format as they are synced to a portable device or burned to a  

 CD/DVD. In addition, it levels volume on-the-fly, which is a   

 huge benefit for most non-iPod devices, and CD/DVDs.     

* Automated Organization - Allows you to set up custom rules for 

 re-organizing tracks in the background. 

* Virtual CD - Allows you to keep track of what CDs you own and at     

 the same time see which subset of tracks from those CDs are    

 copied to your hard drive. Instead of tracking your CDs and     

 tracks separately, the virtual CD function gives you an   

 integrated view.  

* Unlimited MP3 encoding - Allows you to encode MP3s in an  

 unlimited fashion.
