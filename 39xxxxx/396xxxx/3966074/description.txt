The Encyclopedia Demonica

This is the most complete list of Enslaveable Demons in Outland that I have yet to find.  I converted it to a PDF in case the forum disappears (plus I just like having a copy on my hard-drive), but all credit goes the the original researcher (credits are throughout the PDF).

For a more complete listing of demons, since the researcher is still updating, please visit the links included in the PDF.

-------------------------------------------------------

Included in this PDF...

Names of the demons that are immune to enslave attempts

of those who are enslaveable (and which of those are elite)

the power, hitpoints, etc of each demon while enslaved, along with the types of attacks they have.

Once again, all credit goes to the Author, I just made PDF for ease of access.

PS: This is my first attempt at making a torrent, so if it doesn't work, I appologize/
