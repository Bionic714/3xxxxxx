David Icke - From Prison to Paradise
Live in Vancouver...

David Icke is at the top of his form in this live multimedia presentation. You will laugh, you may even cry, and you will be on the edge of your seat as the fantastic story of true human history and who really controls the world today unfolds with Icke?s unique personality and style. This is the presentation the Illuminati, the forces of global control, tried so hard to stop. Just prior to the taping of this program, previously scheduled press interviews were canceled and government officials questioned Icke?s right to free speech. But nothing could silence him or break his spirit and here you will see the result. David Icke shows that if you do not concede to fear anything is possible. .

I\'m reasonably sure this was released in early 2005..
