,sidewinderv2.0,2008-01-07T22:49Z,I'm stuck at 25.7% can someone please seed? Thx
,FlightSimerr,2008-01-08T00:32Z,I'm seeding as fast as I can It's not my fault there are 210 people downloading. I can only upload at 45k due to road runner's limitations. I know a couple of people finished but they didn't' stick around to help seed. fucking assholes as far as I can tell. I want demonoid back... 
,ashwill,2008-01-08T18:37Z,"Stuck at 74.1 :']

Anyone seed?"
,palmofsweden,2008-01-08T19:23Z,Did you even READ flightsimerr's note ashwill? He's seeding! I would bet you're a leecher!
,ashwill,2008-01-08T19:32Z,A what?
,FlightSimerr,2008-01-09T00:23Z,Thank you palmofsweden. I can always count on you to have my back with some trash talking ;-)
,FlightSimerr,2008-01-09T00:36Z,Just lookin at my torrent app and I can count over 20 people at 80%. All I can ask that atleast 50% of you stick around and help seed until your atleast a ratio of 1. Thanks all of you for sticking with it. 
,FlightSimerr,2008-01-09T04:44Z,"For all of you Planning on downloading this torrent, it is tuesday night in the US at 10:42PM EST. I am currently connected to 62 peers that are all at 85% complete. I figure by tomorrow morning if everyone hangs on we should have about 100 people seeding this and that would be excellent becuase as soon as some peeps decided to stick around I have some great scenery and beleive it or not some more CLS planes to upload. 

the files i'm waiting to up aren't as big so they should get out to everyone faster. 

LEt me know how it works out when your done! "
,sidewinderv2.0,2008-01-09T07:02Z,"I'm at 81% right now, thanks to everyone who is seeding. I know I'll be seeding it once it finishes."
,bloodclot84,2008-01-09T13:04Z,seed please
,FlightSimerr,2008-01-09T18:15Z,"Thanks bloodclot84 for asking me to seed. I wasn't going to until you asked me so nicely.  I can't believe I totally forgot to seed. 

Keep up the good work reminding people what to do. Especially people like me who forget to seed. "
,FlightSimerr,2008-01-09T18:20Z,"Just one more update. I am still seeding as fast as I can at 40k. I have uploaded 4.9gb so far and there are over 60 people that I can see that are over 90% complete. it is very close and everyone should be completed or atleast better seeded shortly.


I am going to upload Neuroflight Courchevel V1.1 as soon as some seeders pick up on this file. 

Let me know how it works for everyone. "
,Nassikastike,2008-01-09T19:56Z,Are these planes FS2004 compatible?
,FlightSimerr,2008-01-09T21:40Z,visit CLS's forums to find out how to make them fs9 compat.

,Nassikastike,2008-01-13T17:30Z,THe Airbus 300 GE dosent work. It has no aircraft.cfg or .air file. But they work in FS9.
,FlightSimerr,2008-01-14T20:45Z,works for me in fsx and I have an air file and a aircraft.cfg I would make sure you unzip it correctly into the folder. I just deleted mine. then went to the torrent I uploaded and unzipped it again into my flight sim folder (like I would have if I was doing it for the first time) and it works fine including the aircraft.cfg and the .air file if you want to give me you email I will email you the two files so you can use it in FSX
