I understand that A lot of these aircraft are available on TPB and some available in other places Like WOS. But I have yet to see them all together in one torrent. I have broken them down into .RAR files so you can be selective if you like on what you want to download. I spent a lot of time Putting this package together so please help seed.

               Includes -SP1

(McDonald Douglas)

DC-10 with Tutorial

DC-10 sp1

DC-10 w/INS expansion



All of these work together when copy and pasting the ones that are rips I just replace and remove becuase a lot of them share the same files. It's easy and they work with vista.

I also included a Retail version of FSUIPS 4.4.20 with registration info. 


Thank You!
