--- The series ---------------------------------------------------------------

The series follows the life of anti-social, pain killer addict, witty and arrogant medical doctor Gregory House with only half a muscle in his right leg. He and his team of medical doctors try to cure very ill ordinary people in the United States of America.


--- The episode --------------------------------------------------------------

Two babies in separate delivery rooms delivered by separate staff become deathly ill within minutes of birth. Even though there's no way to explain how an infection could spread between them so quickly, the team must find some way to prevent an epidemic they can't yet identify. In chasing the killer, House must make a choice: give both babies the same treatment and loose both if he's wrong, or give them separate treatments to assure a positive ID of the illness, but also assuring that one of the babies will die.

--- Why this torrent? -------------------------------------------------------

First of all, I didn't make this file but I downloaded it from someone else. 
But with a lot of TV series and movies on this site (and others) it was zipped or 
rarred and like most of you I find that very annoying. 
So I made this torrent with the unzipped content and uploaded it here.

There will probably be more....
