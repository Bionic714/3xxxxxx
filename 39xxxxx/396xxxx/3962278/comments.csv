,martinshameti96,2009-04-05T11:45Z,"Look, i found a solution for fixing the burning problem. Follow the steps and you will be able to burn both of the CD's.

1-Open the CD1 cue file with notepad
2-Now change the first and only line from this:
FILE ""RAT1-JFKPC.BIN"" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

To this:
FILE ""Ratatouille - CD1.bin"" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

3- Now burn the first CD and do the same thing with the CD2 file but in place of: FILE ""Ratatouille - CD1.bin"" put FILE ""Ratatouille - CD2.bin""  "
,eeowdah,2009-10-25T13:33Z,the files were renamed after they were created so the info in the cue files is wrong...
,Admin_007,2010-02-07T19:09Z,"Ok Here is the solution, u just need to mount the images to be able to launch the installation, but to do that u need to rename the bin and cue files bcuz the name are corrupted
Just rename CD1 .cue & .bin to RAT1-JFKPC and CD2 .cue & .bin to RAT2-JFKPC
Now u can mount them without any error"
