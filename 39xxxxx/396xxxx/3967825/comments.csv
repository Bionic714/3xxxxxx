What did you create the image with?
I ask because there are 2 diferent DSR methods.

Check out http://www.goodells.net/dellrestore/fixes.htm

Some systems use a Dell specific restore method and others use a Norton Ghost System. The Ghost based system is tweekable. It seems that the Dell system is not so easy to modify.

This image i'm test goodwork on some laptop DELL system.

I'm clone only dellRestore Partition.

To create image for Dellrestore you must use GHOST8.3 for DOS. The name of image ""FI.GHO"".

If dell DSR error. Try search DSRFIX to fix your MasterBoot in your dell system."
,lkt1827,2008-07-06T02:14Z,"i'm make this image to change old model dell use ghost 8.3 to GHOST10 system restore. 

It same Partition. But Restore ghost 8.3 use 16bit OS for work. Ghost 10 use 32bit OS. And 2 method work good on FAT32 Partition.

But when use this image you can't create restorepoint. "
