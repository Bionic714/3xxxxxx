I've been leaching from the Pirate Bay for a while now, and I figured I'd give something back in the form of a custom voice pack for Worms Armageddon. Now you can enjoy the rants & ravings of your favorite Metalocalyptic foursome, and a couple lines courtesy of Dr. Rockso. I spent 22 long, spun hours ripping audio from [adult swim] Metalocalypse videos and cleaning it up the best I could with free audio mixing software. All in all I rate my voice pack a C+/B- grade, compared to some very poor compilations I've gotten from websites.

All files have been normalized to 100% volume and should be just as loud as the standard worms voices, although some audio may seem a little lower due to differences in pitch. Also, a couple of the wave files are noticeably lower in quality, because I had to manually remove the background sounds/music, which ate away at the vocal audio.
