,Biscotti,2008-08-20T18:52Z,"I own a real copy of MS Office XP Pro and I have a key for it. Since I have a high turnover of computers, laptops, and hard drives I am afraid that one day they will turn me down when I call the telephone activation. Anyone know how to circumvent the activation process for this product or where I can find a Activation KeyGen?"

,Snoxor,2009-09-20T11:16Z,"If you don't have a CD burner, or you don't want to waste a CD, you can simply get a virtual drive and mount the .iso file from your computer. I personally use Gizmo Drive. All you do is mount the .iso with the program and the key is already typed in for you when you go to install Office, so you just click 'next' at that part. 

Anyway, it's very easy, so thanks for the great torrent! "
,ZDaddy,2010-06-20T19:08Z,"Thanks for the upload! Installed with no problems, but when updating make sure you deselect KB949810 (Office Genuine Advantage Notification) or you will be tagged as using ""non genuine"" version of Office."
