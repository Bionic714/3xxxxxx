Doctor Who - Genesis of the Daleks - Japanese - iPod

This collection contains some of the rarest episodes of Doctor Who, ever.   During the 1980's, NHK
Japan (Pony Video) released three Tom Baker episodes on VHS in Japan, with Japanese voice dubbing, different 
incidental music and modified opening and closing segments.  Those episodes were Robots of Death, Revenge of the 
Cybermen and Pyramids of Mars.   

There have always been rumors that other episodes were given the same Japanese treatment of professional 
voice dubbing, different music and opening and closing credits, but none have ever surfaced.  Until now.   

Here you have Genesis of the Daleks.   It has never been released by BBC, NHK or Pony Video, and has only been 
broadcast twice on TV in Japan.  

This version is the highest video and audio quality possible and is perfect for an iPod.  If you do not have 
an iPod, you can watch it with GOMPLAYER, (a free download, excellent video viewer that is better than Windows
Media player)...   

We are still searching Japan to see if more of these rare episodes can be located.   

Do enjoy!
