,capt.night,2008-06-04T18:10Z,"I can say this is Hitlers personal vendetta for pirates , but how can I proof it :o Well it just is?"
,velcro113,2008-07-02T14:31Z,"as far as i know, bethesda doesnt really mind if people get addons to the elder scrolls games... i mean they even gave you a program to edit the game if you bought marrowind!!"
,velcro113,2008-07-02T14:31Z,"and just to be safe, change your ip's after dl'ing this."
,dannyland,2008-08-25T01:30Z,"uhh... you guys are fucking rediculous, ok what if this is a trap....what the fuck is bethseda going to do....they dont even host online games so its not like your gonna get banned from your favorite MMO....plus bethseda is not going to go after piraters with a torrent that they originally had availible for free in the first place. so you fucks who are parinoid go waste 2 bucks for something they just put a price tag on cuz  we aint all billionares u fucks."
,dwworw,2008-09-11T22:58Z,dannylad man you are totaly right
,cdchris12,2008-09-20T10:06Z,Wow. Some of you peeps really think this some ip farming stuffs? That's low. Glad I could help the ppl on TPB that aren't assholes...
,darkmonk56,2008-09-29T00:47Z,"Thanks for a quality mod cdchris and everyone who seeds. I've been looking for this all over. :) Nice to see people keeping games alive. 

Note: to anyone all paranoid about IP farming, just change either your browser IP or if you're using Bittorrent, have it use a different IP mask. >> "
,Advize,2008-10-24T17:06Z,"I'm not sure if this really is an ip farming attempt, but my friend and I downloaded the same Oblivion torrent at the same time using the same ISP and he got a warning from our isp about a complaint from besthesda and he hasn't downloaded another torrent since. I on the other hand feel like I'll get away with it for a whiile yet."
,gnetix,2008-12-23T02:32Z,Can someone help me out? Do I need the expansion packs to use the extensions? I just have the regular Oblivion game with no plugins. (Not the GOTY edition) Thanks for any nfo!!!

,Lucid_Eye,2009-04-10T00:27Z,"lol it isnt a trap, i just downloaded it 3 days ago, despite the fact that it doesnt work, it is completely clean"

This is a common problem when installing and attempting to play an OFFICIAL PLUG-IN on a NO CD CRACK/PATCH. 

To those that don't know their ass from a hole in the ground: Don't say something doesn't work just because you don't know how to use it. Say I need help and don't know what I am doing.  Don't get angry at someone who takes their precious time to upload files for you at no benefit to themselves and make up lies because you are angry that you can't play the plug-in. 

For those that aren't able to start the mission and aren't recieving a journal update alerting you to the existence of the fort besieged by marauders!

Here is the way I installed and played this file.

Step 1: First back up you main save game typically located in ""My Documents\My Games\Oblivion\Saves"" just in case this destroys something. This is something you should always do when installing a mod.

Step 2: Install the Official Battle Horn Castle Plug-In by moving the bsa./esp. files ""DLCBattlehornCastle"" to you game data folder which is ""C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion\Data"" by default.

Step 3: Open the OblivionLauncher and open DATA FILES. Check the box by DLCBattlehornCastle.esp and click OK.

Step 4: Launch the game and load the save game you backed up.

Step 5: Open the console using the tilde ~ key. type in the following...

setstage DLCBattlehornCastle 10

The above console command will add the journal entry and quest marker.

For more information check out The UESPWiki
http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Battlehorn_Castle_(quest)

The above command will also work for the Vile Lair Plug-In here at TPB. Just substitute the name of the quest as ""Deepscorn."""
,Night_Shade_13,2009-06-21T15:01Z,"Please somebody tell me is this safe to download without changing your ip address as i really want this DLC, thank you"
,kgjane,2009-08-08T05:15Z,"I followed all of the helpful steps that Zryo had clearly mentioned ... but when I bring up the console and type in ""setstage DLCBattlehornCastle 10"" it gives me an error .... something like ""Not found for Parameter Quest"" .... basically, it's not finding the quest (even though the files are checked in the ""Game Data"" screen). I even updated the game with the latest patch .... So, am I missing something?"

[T],xxThugxx,2009-08-17T23:37Z,lmfao omg how do these people make it through the day with such a level of stupidity lol
,cdchris12,2009-09-23T12:34Z,"Holy shit! I had forgotten all about this torrent until today. I can't believe people are still keeping it alive!!! Just to re-iterate myself, this is NOT an attempt for Bethesda to get your IP. I personally took this add-on from my copy of the game, and uploaded it here at TPB."
,blackdup,2010-01-30T16:05Z,"doesn't work for me, because the oblivionlauncher's datafiles is grayed out... "

,xcellenzzz,2010-12-22T03:44Z,"It works fine, follow zryo instructions but didnt have to use setstage command .. Thanks"
,Gamer_Keeper,2011-07-25T05:26Z,"Thanks.

Backed up my Save Folder,
Copy and Pasted the 2 files into my data folder,
Turned game on and quest popped right up.
Woeked perfectly on Windows 7 system."
