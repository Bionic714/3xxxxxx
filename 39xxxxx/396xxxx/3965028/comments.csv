Another option is YDL (Yellow Dog Linux).  If you don't already know then don't try.  Research, research, research is the key here...fuckin' Chuck Norris."

""what do torrents do???????????????????????? ""



------LMFAO!...sorry i had to..but seriosly, 
torrents are very small files used to find a download and download it with a bit-torrent such as azereus or Utorrent
"

I've heard all of these songs about 3,000 times from playing the game..why would you want to download them and listen to them more? haaha"
