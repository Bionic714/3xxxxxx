Hey there, all lezzie sisters (and lovers, where ARE you???): This film is a real gem, The Locarno prize winner Journey to Kafiristan, a beautiful epic quest of two women and their relationship, set in 1939. A sort of road movie with ?bursting eroticism and self-discovery? as it says on the box.

The basis of the story is the true story of Swiss writer Annemarie Schwarzenbach who was a friend of the famous writer Thomas Mann?s daughter Erika and her brother Klaus. Annemarie went on a journey from Geneva through the Balkans to the juicy Persia with Ella Maillart who was a cultural anthropologist.

So, this is a dramatized fictitious story of their relationship and their journey together.

Perhaps you saw actress Nina Petri in the funny movie Run Lola, Run! (Lola Rennt)

German speech, English hard subtitles. US edition.
