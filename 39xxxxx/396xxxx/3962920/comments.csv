Leave it to Verizon to lock their phones down so you have to buy it from them!

I did some searching, though, and found some cool stuff at www.modmymoto.com 
It has software that can unlock your phone, but all of that is ""USE AT YOUR OWN RISK"", because if something messes up, your phone is toast!"

,burn1,2008-04-21T13:38Z,"BITPIM.ORG is a program that allows you to view and manipulate data on many CDMA phones from LG, Samsung, Sanyo and other manufacturers. This includes the PhoneBook, Calendar, WallPapers, RingTones (functionality varies by phone) and the Filesystem for most Qualcomm CDMA chipset based phones. To see when phones will be supported, which ones are already supported and which features are supported, see online help. 

What phones do the developers have?

Audiovox  CDM8900  Kindly loaned by RPI Wireless. Unfortunately the internal software on this phone proved to be too fragile and the phone is not supported by BitPim. The phone is also bricked after having been replaced 3 times in prior brickings!
