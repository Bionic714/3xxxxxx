,georgesim,2008-01-04T10:08Z,what is this thing about?
,CaptainPerverto,2008-01-04T10:21Z,"I didn't even think to post something about it. So here's the plot outline.

A series of loosely connected skits that spoof news programs, commercials, porno films, kung fu films, disaster films, blaxploitation films, spy films, mafia films, and the fear that somebody is watching you on the other side of the TV."

,buccaneer123,2008-03-06T06:23Z,"This download consists of a .CUE file and a .BIN file.  Now that it's downloaded to my computer, what am I supposed to do to play the video?  I suppose it's a dumb question, but as someone who knows very little about file formats, I'm at a loss.  Please help.  Thanks."
,CaptainPerverto,2008-04-01T15:17Z,"buccaneer, you just mount it into daemon tools or alcohol 120%. You can either burn it on a DVD or just watch it right on your computer. I usually just mount the .bin file. to watch it."
,buccaneer123,2008-04-16T05:39Z,"Thanks, Captain.  DAEMON Tools Lite 4.12.3 did the job."
