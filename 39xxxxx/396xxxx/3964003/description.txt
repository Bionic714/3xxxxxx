Be warned of some poor acting in this video. If you read comments on imdb and Amazon, you might think this film is just worthless. 

It is not; not if you are serious about lesbian issues subtracted to the very personal life of real girls. Sure, the girls\' mothers show some very poor acting here, but the girls themselves are just such darlings. But if you are a cineaste and accept only very professionally executed feature films, do not bother with this one!

It is a low-budget feature video shot with passion. And the story is very true; just ask the director.
