,lozlink,2008-05-03T03:52Z,1.41 MB for a long series? Not even with one kick ass zip program could you get something that's well over 17 GB into a 1.41 MB file size.
,rodneybf,2008-06-26T21:21Z,"Are you stupid or what?? These are subtitles, not the videos themselves. Dude, youve got learn to read. Subtitles are only TEXT and so 1.41mb is pretty correct. BAKA"
,Slaven152,2008-08-04T09:50Z,"Extra info about these Subs - Intro Clipped. If Episode is FULL Length (Intro Included) These will NOT sync perfectly and might be hard to sync for those who know how. Check your RAW's to see which kind they are.

@rodneybf- Lol. I had to correct a kid on Mininova who wrote ""If you download this, you are a moron."" on the Subs Torrent that was paired with a Torrent for the RAWs. LOL. What is with people lacking common sense and reading skills? Lol. ^_^"
,SylentEcho,2008-11-17T13:49Z,thanks for these.
,Friendsxix,2009-01-25T06:28Z,"BAKA Means ""Idiot"""
,Friendsxix,2009-01-25T06:28Z,"Oh I forgot to mention, that's Japanese."
,Marchauff,2009-11-20T21:46Z,The sync on these is horrible. Anyone know a way to fix this issue?
,xxboubaxx,2010-03-04T13:19Z,"i'll try and sync some.. but i need the permission to upload the new ones then from eduardo;)
i don't wanna strike with the credit of making."
,xxboubaxx,2010-03-04T13:26Z,"hm just read the intro is clipped, and mines are too so maybe i don't need to sync them. i'll look after dl!"
,Moreau,2010-04-21T19:58Z,"guys to sync these just use VLC media player.  it has built in controls of subtitle delay and speed.  just look under advanced options or some shit.
basically if you cant find, theres nothing we can do for you"
,666Reaper,2010-05-05T00:11Z,"Hey , could someone get some subs for this awesome release?
