,bj1604,2009-01-08T18:39Z,"1luckey3 (aka a massive noob)
All you have to do is right click one of the various .rar files and select extract here, then you should see a .iso file, you copy that .iso file into your ISO folder that's located on the root of your memory stick. If you have any further questions you might want to try out something called google or sign up to a psp hacking forum and ask questions there.

,Mellandry,2009-02-06T16:04Z,maybe im just blind but when i have unpacked the first 1rar then the 2. bigger file. then there is the folder PSP Game but no .iso 
,NASTY_138,2009-02-23T10:57Z,"This is a rip, right?"
,boxingrules,2009-03-21T07:13Z,Thanks! I finally was able to put a game on. Thanks again!
,bj1604,2009-04-08T12:51Z,"@ Mellandry
Winrar also openes and extract .iso files, if you get a GAME folder inside what you believe to be another .rar file then that means you have extracted the .iso file, only extract what you've downloaded ONCE.

@NASTY_138
Yes it is thus the ""UMDRIP"" on the name.

@PRZuki
It very clearly states in the description of the torrent that the password is : fantastico.cl
And i have just red the your next comment stating that you've finally figured out the obvious. LOL (no offense xD).

@ALL THE NOOBS!!!!
All the information you need is in the description, if you noobs still dont get it ( -.-' ) then just use a very usefull tool called : google"
