,XxWaRxMaChIn3xX,2008-01-20T19:36Z,This is the real deal. I downloaded it and the audio/video is 10/10. The onlt 2 things i can mention are that of course there is the watermark on the screen stating its a dvd screener and also that i had to use VLC player to watch it as my media player i guess didn't have the right codecs to watch it properly but all in all. totally awsome job by this uploader! thanks man!
