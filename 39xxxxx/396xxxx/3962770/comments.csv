The film is funny and exciting at times, with both predictable and unpredictable turns - but the subtitles suck! They go way too fast. Everthing said is translated directly, it seems, so it's impossible to keep up when you don't understand hindi. Sometimes the English translation is very poor as well. Worth the watch with better subtitles, or if you speak hindi."
