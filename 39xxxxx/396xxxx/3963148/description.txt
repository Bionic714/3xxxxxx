Serart - When musical worlds collide, a new sphere of rich sound is born. Such is the case of SERART, a collaboration between Arto Tuncboyaciyan (tunk-boy-a-jian) and Serj Tankian, who have found common ground in shared Armenian backgrounds and a passion for sonic explorations.

This is the Bonus DVD included with the Special Edition release of the album "Serart".
