10 years of Punk-Rock 'n' Roll with class. 10 years of powerful riffing, dynamic songwriting and catchy melodies. VÃ¤sterÃ¥s' finest are back with a bang. 
"Moonlight City" is their 7th record and exactly the right stuff to celebrate their anniversary, and once again Psychopunch deliver what they stand for, Punk'n'Roll with attitude. After the previous success of previous record "Kamikaze Love Reducer", the Swedish four-piece is back to continue what they have started.
"Kamikaze Love Reducer" was as diverse as it was powerful. Also the songwriting showed the band move a step forward. Many shows were played after the release and the songs became a standard in their dynamic live set. With "Moonlight City" they keep moving into the same direction. Melody  and power walk hand in hand and the band presents itself as one big impact, produced once more 
by Pelle Saether at Studio Underground. The Punk-Rock'n'Roll thing is still on and plenty of shows take place every day and everywere. Many bands have come and gone. Reason enough to prefer the ones who manage to remain on the scene. And 10 years are something to show respect for.
A decade in punk, rock and style!
