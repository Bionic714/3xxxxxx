,matt_z,2008-02-02T21:05Z,"Why can't someone upload a normal file, not this .mkv bulls***! I can't even watch it using the media player classic, because the sound skips a lot and is not in sync with the picture, even when I tried following the instructions!!!"
,standardkiller,2008-02-03T09:40Z,thats because your computer cant handle high def. older and slower computers are not fast enough to play movies like this. how about you look for the version of the movie thats not high def
,asdasd123123,2008-02-29T22:37Z,"It's not in 720p, it's a little lower, 960x544.
Should be 1280x.. But still, acceptable."
