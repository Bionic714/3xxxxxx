[T],kirklestat,2008-01-06T03:26Z,"preferred to fit in 1 CD.

,Bit_Lover,2008-07-13T13:49Z,"Video - 7/10
Audio - 8/10

I expected much worse quality from this one. but this one is very good quality, given that riped 3hrs into 700MB.Sub comes with it so no need to find them. And also I had record speed when downloading this. Uses 90% of my bandwidth.

So thanx for seeding."

Saw your note on screen shots-looks great to me. Also I was listening to sirens & rock & roll music all my life & no longer hear consonants & 75% of my hearing is now gone.

I can't make out shit anymore, so many Kudos for also  making the subs a part of the  DL.

Especially when anymore you have to keep DL 20 or more subs these days to find one that matches up correctly.

 So I usually look for DL's that have subs put in as they usually match up. 

You saved me the trubble of having to sort through a bunch to find a sub which works.

Again, Many thanks"
