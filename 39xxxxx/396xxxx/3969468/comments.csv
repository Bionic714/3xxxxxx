Hoping for a bit more info though. I don't quite get was is going on with the extra roms and release numbers not being right etc. Can you please clarify. Very much appreciated."
[T],magumagu,2008-01-22T19:43Z,"At first I followed the Pocket Heaven release list. This list included games which weren't actual games, but flash-card firmware and whatnot.

When i swapped lists, the one that had been number 1800 was number 1797 in the new list. Thus a discrepancy of three roms occurred. This was fixed in the transition pack.

Then it surfaced that three roms in the Pocket Heaven list had different crc32 checksum than the equivalents in the ADVANsCEne list. This was supposed to be fixed in the first discrepancy fix.

I fucked up and misread one number by one and added one rom wrong to the last pack. That was fixed in this torrent.

There you have it ...
