[T],Ozflik,2008-01-04T22:31Z,No it is not virus i just bought the game and my pc couldn't handle it so i just copied the cd key. I thought you could play online
,linkinkampf19,2008-01-06T20:37Z,"K. Sorry bout that Ozflik. As much as I love PB, there are sometimes too many fishy torrents that arise from the deep. Sad that the individuals who do do that type of stuff are retroactive and aren't helping the overall image ha us pirates strive for :P"
,mungo75,2008-01-08T06:26Z,"Well it appears to be a text file, so I doubt there is much harm, but it would have made more sense just to post it in the forums as text.

The only thing is of course that you do need on-line activation for the game, (there is no multiplayer component), but I have read you can only use that key a handful of times.

If what the uploader says is true - he has just thrown away his game because he will never be able to activate it when he does get a PC that can handle it.

Of course he could just get a patch from here. ;-)"
,jase022107,2008-01-21T16:08Z,"Okay, I copied and pasted the key, but it came up invalid. I tried entering it in all caps, also invalid. I even changed anything that coulda ben a typo, like o's to 0's ans i's to 1's. Invalid. IF anyone has better luck, lemme know."
