,122473786,2008-01-06T20:42Z,"""Chriskezn :
Sick of slow downloads? Try Waushare.com, HTTP downloads. Safer, faster and legal.""

oh give us a break, HTTp downloads would only meant that movie is upload to rapidshare, megaupload and same typle of file host, and they only give 1 download in one hour if you dont have their premium account, most movies is been cut into more than 5 files, so why should we give up bittorent which takes maxium 1 hour and free, and go for that ""fast only if you pay"" type method?

PS: LEGAL download?  Shut that bullsh*t, any type of method of download copyrighted materials consider illegal, it doesnt make it legal when u download in via rapidshare, do you think we are morons?"

,rob316uk,2008-01-08T18:45Z,what a load of shit i downloaded it last nyt and watched it and its such a waste of tym its nt reli funny and its stupid y seed such crap tut tut
,mightyfox,2008-01-08T21:55Z,"OK a few things here:

1) I seldom comment because most of the comments that ARE here, (written mostly by dumb, slap happy Americans- and before you flame, I *AM* an American, so go tell Bushy,)... are mostly spam and have very little to add to this site.  Between trolls, people from the movie corps. (that are losing a shit load of money,) and dumb, anti-tech American script kiddies, there is surprisingly little here regarding the TORRENT and not bullshit spam.

2. I AM commenting (this time) because I think that this is a good download, and to those that say it's boring: bullshit.  Go watch ""Across the Universe"" if you want boring.  That self-pretentious crap can't even hold my stoned attention for more than 10 minutes.

Lastly, it's good quality.  So here's the NON-SPAM breakdown:

Movie quality: 10/10 (it's a perfect rip not a cam)
Movie sound: 10/10 (works fine on my speakers)
Subs? : YES (subtitles came up in VLC)

Overall movie ""boredom"" or ""interesting"" rating:

6/10 

It's not the worst movie ever, but to you movie execs here that just spam EVERYTHING as either unwatchable or ""bad"", realize this: You can't stop us.  I've downloaded NO FAKE copies of ANYTHING from pb.  That's bullshit to assume otherwise.  If there WAS fake stuff on here, it wouldn't take long to weed itself out and then be gone.  To all you people screaming ""BAD QUALITY!"" or whatever, it's bullshit.  I've downloaded some slightly ""dark"" movies, and even some ""low"" quality movies, but over 95% of EVERYTHING here is watchable. 

The BOTTOM LINE to my rant?:

FUCK YOU spammers!  I hate you.  I wish I could find you people...

FUCK YOU movie execs!  Make watchable movies and I'd buy `em anyways (if the DVDs were cool and didn't contain ""extra footage"" of bullshit)

and finally,

FUCK YOU LEECHERS! 

I've done it FROM TIME TO TIME, but most of the time I give back MORE than what I take: it's the code and the way.  

To you bitching moaning script kiddies that want to spam all these worthwhile works that you wouldn't take the time to seed yourselves: FUCK OFF and go enjoy ""free"" american television, complete with its literally IQ crushing, mind dulling 10 minute commercial breaks between its barely lucid seven and a half minutes of ""programming"" (COUGH).  BOTTOM BOTTOM LINE: to those that help and make this place better, SWEET, you rock.  To everyone ELSE (this PROBABLY means you!)- Fuck off, go away, and let the non-bitchers and the seeders play.

Peace to all, (esp. most seeders which are basically 90% NOT american)!  Thank you esp.! :)  Take care.

,mightyfox,2008-01-09T02:03Z,Amazingly funny that the VERY NEXT COMMENT proved my entire point.  Ha.

,mightyfox,2008-01-10T16:14Z,"@Lord (awesome) ;)

Yeah it's silly.  You give these kids computers and the ""internet"" (are serious business! LOL!) and the next thing you know, the hottest torrents are EMO punk downloads, and the ""best"" movies (you know- like the ones here, that are often ""unwatchable""), will have 10,000 leeches but 7 seeders.  It's just the way it is.  Coupled with the spam, (WHO WRITES this SHIT?!?  Seriously... if I could only find ONE of them, I would be so happy,) it's hard to find what's what.  That's why when I rate, I rate it loud so it cuts through the 12 year old nonsense.  I've been doing downloads since 9600 b was considered FAST on BBS's.  You know the story; I'm not going to tout how 'l33t' I am; that's bullshit, too.

I WILL say this: ONCE again, not the worst movie ever.  I've actually downloaded a couple good ones from the 'bay recently, so just keep doing what you're doing.  And YES as far as being an American- we're not ALL sheeple, (most of the sheeple are sheep, make no mistake!)  I see what's going on in this fucked up country.  I LOVE my country but FEAR and HATE my government, and 99% of the people that post here and think they are just so fucking cool spamming their god damn myspace pages.  It's crap; if there's a ""karma god"", then many many people will die someday-soon! :)

To the seeders, thanks again- peace.

,ilovejolie86,2008-01-15T13:48Z,"mightyfox - thanks for the review. I'm downloading it now. I agree, people need to stick to discussing the quality of the files instead of ranting and raving about how 'bad' it is. I'm sure most of us know how to look on imdb, or even youtube for a trailer. 

I have a pretty odd sense of humor, so who knows? I love Four Rooms which a lot of people ""don't get"". Hell, I sat through ""I think I love my wife"" yesterday without falling asleep, and it HAS to be better than that piece of shit..."

,madmarilyn,2008-01-18T08:24Z,"I can say that i've never had a password or a fake torrent here on piratebay during the years i've used it, it is a great site. i know that on sites like mininova, a few torrents has passwords but never on piratebay. and i think it's so sad, when you click on a torrent and read the comments on almost EVERY fucking torrent on piratebay there's just spam, all over, hardly ever anything about the torrent it self. sometimes there is a sane person who writes something honest about the torrent, but that's like 5% of all comments. when i read all these comments, i just want to find out if the torrent is good or not, if the film is watchable or not. 
i really think piratebay is the best free torrentsite there is, and i'm proud it is swedish but sadly there's a lot of unthankfull shit here to who is selfish and doesn't even seem to understand how great it is that some people spends a lot of time uploading and creating torrents for you to downlad, FOR FREE. 
so be greatfull, ffs. "

Keep up the good work FXG though :D"

,gurumed,2008-02-29T01:51Z,"All the people griping about how bad this movie was makes me sad, why do people laugh at the same old cliche bullshit Hollywood puts out and hate classical absurdist/random comedy? I grew up with the State so I hated when Stella only lasted one season when stuff like Mind of Mencia where he just recycles the same stuff is way popular, at least they had some success with Reno 911 "
,ran67,2008-03-04T07:47Z,I was a fan of Stella and those guys but this movie indeed sucked ass.  I don't recall laughing even once.  The intros to each story were unnecessary and not funny at all.  Overall a waste of time/bandwidth.
,bigmantonyd,2008-03-31T05:02Z,"The pirate bay comments are not the place for movie reviews, they're for talking about the quality of the download:

the torrent was fast

the video quality was pretty good


That said, PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS MOVIE.  Seriously, I never put reviews here, but I saw all these comments before I d/led it and I still watched it.  The trailer got me really interested and the all-star cast pushed it over the top... ""Who cares if it went straight to dvd?""  You should, cause it means the movie sucked.  I honestly could not name a single ""good part"".  That was a complete waste of an hour and a half."

The ""joke"" is not solely on what character says or does but you have to look at the whole situation they're in.

That being said, it's not for everyone. I'd recommend checking some of David Wain's productions on Youtube to get an idea of what to expect."

That's why b.s. like that Mencia fool (who was chased off by the comedic community for stealing and repackaging other people's jokes) are well received, and other shows that take a little thought, are not.
