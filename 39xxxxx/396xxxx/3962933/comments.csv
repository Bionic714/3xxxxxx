I allow yesterday 10.2 was very nice, but today I do not know who will buy it ;p"
[T],castortroy4693,2008-01-06T04:44Z,"Not asking them to buy it from me.  I'm just saying that they should support Apple if they continue to use it (It probably won't happen, but it's worth saying anyways)"
,whataniceday,2008-01-08T15:38Z,"slow download, please seed!"
,gombal12345,2008-01-08T18:55Z,"Please Seed, really need this one! Stuck at 26.4 % now."
,xek21,2008-01-12T15:50Z,"Yes.....same here

Thanks!"
,Jarvis083,2008-01-15T07:13Z,"hey i'm stuck at 60.7%  can someone seed please!

thanks, cody."
,minacciosa,2008-01-17T07:23Z,Seed plz!!!!!!!!!!! 63.3%!
,unrar,2008-01-18T22:46Z,"torrent is stuck at 64.22%. 

""This file does have the keygen / crack included in the file.
Please read the files included in the file you are downloading to figure out how to use the crack!""

this is suspect as os x needs no password or crack to install. be careful windows users..."
,charssun,2008-01-21T08:22Z,"Just as unrar noted, the Mac OS does not require registration nor serial numbers.  You simply install it, and then ignore the registration procedure.  (The registration I'm referring to is the application that opens automatically once you've installed Mac OS X.  It asks for you to fill in your address, email, and other personal information, but you may simply quit the app so that it doesn't dial up Apple and send your info.)"
,charssun,2008-01-21T16:50Z,"Mine is stuck at 63.3%, too.  Looks like this torrent is bad...or perhaps someone's idea of a prank.  Don't bother attempting to download this one."
,mstrhugs,2008-01-25T02:09Z,"can someone seed? if i can download all the way, i'll seed but at the moment I've gone up to 69% and it's been five weeks I've been downloading"
,charssun,2008-01-26T08:10Z,"I'll seed too.  In fact, I am right now: I've got 76% downloaded, and since you seed as you are downloading, I've been seeding off and on for days (mostly at night).  A few moments ago I got a few bits downloaded, but now there aren't any peers (except for the one(s) I'm uploading to.

I've been digging around some private trackers and other places, so if I find Jaguar anywhere I'll let you know.  It shouldn't take *months* to d/l this.  Are you in any private trackers?  I need to get invited to some decent ones..."
,gombal12345,2008-02-01T08:53Z,"Got 81.3% now, sometimes there is someone with a 100% buti can't seem to download directly from him/her.But i guess at this rate i just have to be patient!"
[T],castortroy4693,2008-02-05T02:40Z,"Sorry, I'm seeding the master file, and the server locked up and I didn't realize it until a few days ago.

Sound be going now."
,roachfingers,2008-02-06T02:58Z,More seeds please! Many of us are stuck at 99.1%!
,gombal12345,2008-02-06T14:52Z,"Got it complete this morning and it works perfectly!
Thanks!"
,roachfingers,2008-02-07T02:28Z,Mine is corrupted? I can't extract it in any ISO extractor...
,gombal12345,2008-02-07T08:21Z,"Mine neither but when i burned it with Nero and booted my mac G3 with it it installed beautifully!
P.S. Anyone know where to get OSX 10.1?"
,Vorperblad,2008-02-16T09:56Z,"CastorTroy U are bloody brilliant!!!  Thanx Thanx Thanx to U! 

I have FINALLY got my misses Imac running. She's had this little blue gem for yonks but not able to get it online, not been able to do sweet-stuff-all with it because heaps of features were disabled/deleted.

Gombal12345 you're spot-on about burning the Isos to disc then run the Imac. The PC sees the Isos as Win.RAR files that can't be opened/corrupt, but burning as BOOTABLE iso WILL WORK on the Mac!!! Probably because the volume format isn't NTFS, it's a MFS only Mac recognises.

So... we're stoked, thanx mate - you ROCK!!!
...oh and all U seeders... THANX to U all for keeping this alive."
,rass007,2008-02-24T20:07Z,where can i get keygen or crack for it plz help.
,DannyDucktail,2008-03-14T00:48Z,"Are there 2 isoÂ´s ? and if so, do i have to burn them both as bootable?"
,rafarc1989,2008-05-16T20:30Z,"I was trying to install it on my powermac g4, and when appear the screen with the black apple, my monitor goes like freeze!
how can I install it?"
,cebolla13,2008-06-22T22:16Z,"Thanks so much for this! It works 100% perfect on my iMac G3. Just burn the two iso files on separate cd's and install on your mac. No passwords, no cracks needed. Brilliant!"
,Aratsu,2008-06-27T21:51Z,"Glad to see people seeding this, I'll join in on the effort, as it's getting harder and harder to find older versions of OS X for those of us not fortunate enough to have newer macs."
,ashasaur,2008-07-17T20:36Z,"Thanks for the upload my man, works great, got it installed on my iMac G3-400MHz last night...works like a charm!"

,hear2seed,2008-07-26T00:43Z,"please seed going very slow

,rh128592,2008-08-07T03:37Z,"I was able to burn these using XP for installation on an old G3 iMac/333.  Here's what worked for me:

1. I used Roxio 10.  Yeah, it's bloated, but I couldn't get CD BurnerXP to work.

2. Select ""COPY"" then ""BURN IMAGE""

3. Select the image.

4. Now click ""Options"" by the BURN button.

5. I don't know which setting actually closes the deal, but here's what I clicked:

GENERAL>ADVANCED: I burned at both 48x and 7x but, to be certain on this old P4 of mine, I picked 7x.

DATA AND BACKUP: Click ""I only need to use disc for one recorder"" basically Disc-at-once.

COPY: Click 'em all, especially ""USE RAW MODE"".  I could be full of shit, but I think that's what did it.

I got 2 good burns using this.  Going for 3 now."
,astrical,2008-10-14T00:38Z,brilliant. thankyou so much. my little imac g3 lives again. you are a hero.
,Darkspy946,2008-11-03T21:44Z,Thanks alot! you saves my Macbook G3's Life!

,nitrous9200,2009-12-12T03:46Z,"Great torrent, not running this anymore but it served me very well on my iMac G3. 
This should work on many (if not all) G3 and G4 machines. Check everymac.com for your model and find the original OS installed section to find out if this will work."
,djcool81,2010-01-22T06:05Z,"Thans for this up man,
i never worked with a mac before so I got one (G3 266) for free without any software. So now i can play with it and look if it is a good replacement for freaking windows."
