Detailed instructions on building a real working flamethrower, also has instructions to modify the device to be wrist mounted (like Boba Fett) and a few other variants.  Can be built with commonly available items.  Please use extreme caution in construction, I dont want anybody killing themselves out there (however killing other people with the completed device would be okay as long as the video is posted on youtube)
