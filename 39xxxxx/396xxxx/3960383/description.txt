This is a valid, working, clean installing Windows XP Corp edition. No Key is needed. I have personally installed this on 10 PC's, and not one of them has had a problem. All have been running nonstop for a month now, and they even update :)

This is NOT a self installing file. This is an ISO, an IMAGE file. You MUST use software such as Daemon Tools or Alcohol 120% in order to burn this to disk and use. If you do not know how to do this, please research a little before downloading and posting that it doesn't work. Comments from users are appreciated to let others know about the download!

Initial Seed (Me) is being done on a true 10mbps pipe (Meaning I can send at up to 1.25 megabytes per second total). Please be considerate and seed back for a while, as re-seeding is what keeps torrent alive!
