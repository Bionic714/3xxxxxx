,jikbag,2008-01-05T05:09Z,Didn't work for me.  Beware.
,Skywize,2008-01-06T02:54Z,"Could you be a little more detailed on how it did not work? I know it works, so you did something wrong. What error did you get?"
,mg4150,2008-01-06T08:05Z,Downloaded this and burned ISO file to a CD.  Just installed off of the CD onto a machine and it works great!  Didn't ask for a reg key at all.  Thanks for posting this!

,rockercover,2008-01-07T14:38Z,Can you tell me whether it's SP2 or greater?
,Skywize,2008-01-07T21:01Z,"It is SP2, however, make sure you have all the drivers for your hardware before you install this as it is likely that they are not included."
,bladez360,2008-01-08T02:13Z,do u have to load the cd when i boot up or can i load it normally
,Skywize,2008-01-09T05:35Z,Restart the PC with the CD in the drive. It will install from there.
