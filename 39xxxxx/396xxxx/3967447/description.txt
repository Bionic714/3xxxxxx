Stolen from MovieX, and I havn't had a chance to watch it, so NO IDEA about quality.

Sorry for the Bitcomet padding, I like Bitcomet as a client, but if anyone has any suggestions for a torrent maker, I'm up for comments, all that padding is dumb.

This all below is plundered from Moviex, and all put here where it belongs.
