,True_astoroth,2008-01-11T09:05Z,"Thanks for the thought, but if you're too poor to buy it, then chances are that people are too poor to afford the monster computer that can run this on good settings."

,Lasher,2008-01-19T20:29Z,"To all Crysis Haters. 

Go and assfuck your xbollox 3shitty or nintendo piss. super-shoot jizz up the homo erotic master queer, or have a bash at mario fag party.

consoles are shitniggerish, like you jizzswallowers, i swapped a gaystation 3 for a 8800 ultra, best thing I did. 

so, die of aids little console fagboys, and remember, dinner is ready soon, you'll have to turn it off."
,Enyap,2008-01-19T20:55Z,"Are you sane Lasher?
Jeez. :O"
,barometer2053,2008-01-20T01:55Z,"I Agree with lasher, all these fag boys who are Crysis haters are to much of a cock goblin to be able to afford a machine that runs it decently or are to stupid to see just how kick ass the game is. This is the best looking game EVER to hit the shelfs so all  you bitches who dog the game for stupid reasons can just craw into a hold and die.

Crysis set the standard for all FPS's. There is nothing that even comes close to the beauty of this game.

Not to mention that Crysis's Sister game Frycry 2 is going to set the bar even higher, Free Environment over a linear game will always win.

So enjoy the game, for it is the best FPS iv seen in a LONG time, not many games can you play the campaign over and over again and still find new paths or methods of completing the objective. For all the people who have a fast enough machine to run it with the Veryhigh patch or in DX10 mode will fall in love with it, for it is like a CG movie that you play.

Once again Enjoy the game and dont forget to help seed! :)"
,31415926,2008-01-20T13:50Z,Consoles.. PCs.. who fkng care? Better tell me whotz on those bonus DVD and CD.
,ObSo-1337,2008-01-20T14:08Z,"why hate crysis?

what do you hate about it?


Its the best game ive played in a long time"
,Enyap,2008-01-20T16:36Z,"No one here hates crysis except, maybe, the first poster.
But, Christ, how fucked up a person should be to use that kind of language as Lasher.

Bonus DVD contains some vids - making Crysis, trailers and things like that."
,Nicholas_Corozzo,2008-01-20T20:26Z,"For Those About to Suck! Fuck you, Crysis Is THE Best Game Ever! And If You Can't Afford A Computer Go Fuck Henrich!"
,barometer2053,2008-01-21T05:21Z,"I know you get a Special APC in the SE version of the game aswell. Along with ""The Making Of"" Concept Art, Trailers, and the the way the game was going to be before it was changed so many times.

Anyone remember the story about the game that a meteor hit the island and North Koreans went there to get alien tech and US Special Forces came to stop them from doing so? yeah that changed real fast, think this game had like 3 different stories at one point."
,Thisiscjfool,2008-01-22T17:58Z,"kyleain stop spamming. no one wants to read some bs that you stole from some other website, and no one wants to read about how charles darwin is wrong."
,Enyap,2008-01-22T21:17Z,"It kinda lacks exploration and alien part is boring.
But grabbing Koreans by neck and teaching them how to fly is amazing thought."
,BleedingCello,2008-01-23T00:14Z,Thanks for the upload.  I'll seed till 1.0 but thats it loi
,whitewolf227,2008-01-23T01:44Z,Guys get this torrent it works like a charm and it's in a simple ISO file so if you have any problems this is likely your first game torrent and have no idea what your doing. Thanks so much detonador your the best!
,31415926,2008-01-23T13:38Z,Thanks Enyap and uploader. And what is on the audio CD?

,ylegged,2008-01-27T08:22Z,BAD BAD BAD. This torrent has been edited so you can't get past the second level: RECOVERY. Some rocks have been placed in the cave so it's impossible to pass thought to get to the next level RELIC.  You can fix this retardation by using the mission editor SANDBOX on the village.cry file in the game/levels folder to remove these obstacles. GEE THANKS FOR ALL THE HEADACHES guys 
,Diablojoe420,2008-01-28T03:50Z,"I'm somewhat new to downloading torrents and such, but I think I have the gist of it so far.

I have one question about the game, can you play online, cause I just recently DLed UT3 but turns out that someone got smart and made it so only REAL serial keys will let you play online (like the ones on the back or inside the cd case) and fake ones will only let you play the campaign (wich isnt bad but i'd like to play online w/ my friends so i'll prob end up buying it) so is it the same deal with this game or will it play with a fake key?"

,xTZero,2008-02-23T02:47Z,"Hey guys, I DLed this torrent a while ago I just never had the time to try it and so I go to mount the image file on Daemon Tools and then install the game itself and go to play it and it says something like ""Please Insert The Original Copy of Crysis into the D: drive"" or something like that, and as everyone who uses Daemon often would know that the Daemon uses drives I: J: K: and L: I believe and so I can't play it because the game isn't in the main physical drive (drive D:). I'm not new to this kind of stuff and I know I could put it on a disk but those disks are expensive (5$ for 1 disk) I'm wondering if there's another way to play this without burning it to a disk?"

,ThE_DoOmSdAyEr,2008-03-12T01:58Z,"I'll tell you anyway. In the RAR file in the ""Extras"" you need to take one of those EXE's Bin32 or Bin64 and replace it with the one in Crysis/Bin.

you dont have to burn it to a disk, just mount with daemon tools"

-download the file
-use powerarchiver or a similar program  to extract compressed files
-mount the image with daemon tools
-install along with any cracks
-to use the no-cd fixes find the games install directory in your program files and find the exe file that stats the game, replace tht with the fixed no-cd exe file


best way to go is to get your games here
fixes at gamecopyworld.com
serials at serials.ws (a lot of porn ads on the site but its the best ive found for serials)"

will that work as an alternative to daemon tools, but more importantly, will powerISO work to mount the image,

okay so after i download the game, what do i do???
i need help.."
,uwantblood,2008-09-11T02:33Z,"STEP BY STEP GUIDE!!!

1. Download torrent (I didnt download extra audio or video files, made it 6 gigs instead of 8)

2. Mount the .iso file using daemon tools and install game (I used 5DKK-G7PQ-GKJM-FYUW-KNMP for the key.)

3. Then install ""Crysis_Patch_1_1"" from the original folder.

4. Use Winrar to extract ""crack 1.1"" and replace it in bin 32.

5. Launch the game.

This way worked for me. 

For everyone with ""insert proper disk error"" you didnt replace the crack correctly.

Pentium T4300 (dual core, 2.1ghz)
4gb RAM
NVIDIA GeForce GT 220M (1gb of vram)
Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit

People will tell you that you need a $1500 computer to play Crysis, but my $700 laptop runs it absolutely flawlessly on medium, and it's more than playable on high! Very high is a stretch and the lag is too much, but there is NO LAG WHATSOEVER on medium and a very small, barely noticeable lag on all high settings. My PC is alright, but not great (2.1ghz is mediocre), and if your specs are in my neighborhood or better, then it should run fine. In my experience, the video card is the most essential element for gaming, followed by RAM. Just follow the simple, clear installation steps and don't be retarded."

,ka40,2011-07-12T05:12Z,"@jaktbone
Yeah, when you go online you sent packets to the server (developers), in that packet of data you send, you'll reveal your location a.k.a ip.

With that ip the developers can track you down, following a fine and, or imprisonment (depending on the country/state).
So that's why you don't go online.

And i don't know if it's really stop your ip from sending because, that's the only way that the server could know where to get the data to let you go mp. (ip masking is not 100% effective)"

The instructions were not that detailed but I guess the author was expecting all of the users are familiar with the procedures and stuffs. So for those who encountered these problems follow these instructions:

1. Extract ""Crack 1.1"". (You will have 2 folders --> ""Bin 32"" and ""Bin 64"")
2.  Copy and replace the ""Crysis.exe"" from the extracted folders to the installed folders for both ""Bin 32"" and ""Bin 64"" folders. **********CAUTION************
DON'T REPLACE THE WHOLE ORIGINAL FOLDER WITH THE EXTRACTED FOLDER as this's the common mistake that causes the problems.
