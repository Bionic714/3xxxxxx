From their website:

CLOVIS MANN is a rising power trio out of Madison, WI playing songs about love, life, and struggle, while combining rock, blues and jam music with a penchant for hard-driving rhythms, transcendental soloing, and inspiring improvisation. Comprised of Stosh Jonjak on bass, Ethan Noordyk on drums and percussion, and Daniel Walkner on guitar, vocals, slide, and harmonica, Clovis Mann is no stranger to the stage. Determined to bend genres and explore new musical territories Clovis Mann can guarantee their fans something wholly new and original for every show. Catch them live some time, it may change everything.
