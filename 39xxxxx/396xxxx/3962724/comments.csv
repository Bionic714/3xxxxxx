,blanketofwoe,2008-02-08T05:15Z,amazing film. Eagle VS. Shark. Also check out Bear VS. Shark this is a movie not a film.
,p3on,2008-02-24T03:09Z,"this movie is unbelievably poor. it's literally napoleon dynamite with new zealanders and not as funny. everyone who likes it is a 13 year old with no taste or experience in films. go see margot at the wedding, or even some wes anderson films."
,Emaan,2008-03-09T17:02Z,"This movie sucks so bad and is so boring that after I watched half of it, I had to blow the dust off my eyes.."
,TFBundy,2008-03-17T15:20Z,"One of the wittiest movies ever, I want a crazy burger now, foolish suckers!!!  It is a bit like N Dynamite; but way smarter and without the tedious American BS of freaks finding acceptance with straights. These ppl are irredeemably freaks... "
,gnavs,2008-03-17T17:27Z,"I liked this movie, its refreshingly different.  I'm sick of generic Hollywood generated shit.  Bring on movies with imagination.  The rest of you can take your tired and predictable storylines and feel comforted by the fact that your movie premise has been beat to death many times before."
,kristofferalpsjo,2008-07-23T01:35Z,"Hey, any feedback on the quality of the release? Or are we all supposed to review the movie here now?"
,newguy69,2008-11-21T21:23Z,Good film. Very funny in parts. 4/5. Good DVD Quality for 700MB! Thanks to FXG_team. Download now & seed!
,frank9p,2009-07-22T09:15Z,"napolean dynamite with new zealanders.  haha. now i gotta watch this...

cant be worse than The Hangover. "
,FreeTibet,2010-02-03T14:08Z,"Beautiful! One of the best movies of the past decade. I guess some people just don't ""get it"". Maybe it's too subtle?"
,Ian_Iguana,2011-05-07T13:05Z,this movies awesome.. Go Dangerous Person!
