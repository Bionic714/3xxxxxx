,Sheppy1,2008-01-08T17:16Z,"The crack is the file called iPhoneRingToneMaker (the file that's a picture of an iphone), copy this file into ""C:/Program Files/iPhoneRingToneMaker/"" directory and then open the file you will then be asked for a serial number, just enter anything you want and then it will work"
,115951999,2008-01-08T21:29Z,"Can any1 get this thing working, ive got the crack sorted but when i send the files to my phone they arent on my ringtone list. any body help?"
,Sheppy1,2008-01-08T23:40Z,"In the program select ""Manage My Ringtones"" from the top then at the bottom of the next screen click on ""To restore your ringtones click here"" that should sort it, the reason they probably aren't showing up is because sometimes when you sync your phone with itunes it will remove them, doing ^^^^ that will restore them, hope this helped"
,numb0617,2008-01-10T04:32Z,i have Vista im not sure if it will make a difference but i cant get the crack to work i got the trial version only

,numb0617,2008-01-13T23:03Z,i got the trial working and i used it three times when i put some random numbers in though it didn't work
,Sheppy1,2008-01-14T04:07Z,It might be because you are using windows vista
,tankbart,2008-01-16T00:27Z,"Tried on Windows XP Professional. Swedish version with service packs and all updates.
The ""cracked"" file causes a crash and could not get it to work."
,numb0617,2008-01-16T04:25Z,when i copy the cracked version into the installation directory and ran it the serial number i typed in was wrong(at least that is what it said)

,Sheppy1,2008-01-17T18:35Z,"is it really that hard??

Install the file called ""iPhone-Ringtone-Maker-2.0.2-Setup"" when that has finished installing put the file called ""iPhoneRingToneMaker"" which is the file with a little picture of an iPhone into the directory ""C:/Program Files/iPhoneRingToneMaker"" and then run that file which you just put in there then if it asks you for a serial enter anything you want then it will work, it has worked for me and it has worked for many other people, if that doesn't work then i don't have a clue what's wrong, but that's exactly what i did"
,SmartChickxx,2008-01-18T04:30Z,"OMG, I only got to use It 4 one day n then I dl the new iphone update (1.1.3) and it disabled da program. Any suggestions?"
,Sheppy1,2008-01-18T08:51Z,This program will not work with 1.1.3 it says on eifkos site (the people that make it)
,hardm2000,2008-01-26T20:38Z,"You are a fucking legend my friend IT DOES WORK WITH VISTA, as he says if you can't understand the instructions youve got problems, oh and it does work with 1.1.3 cods if you crack this version and then install latest from web it updates itself free and 1.1.3 is supported. Once again THANKS!!"
,gricka31,2008-01-27T22:58Z,latest version please? this one is not compatible with the latest iphone software
,Sheppy1,2008-01-28T01:15Z,"@gricka31

I am not going to reupload this with the new software as i dont know if the crack will work with it but i do know if you do what hardm2000 said then it will work with the new update so basically...do what i said in the description then go to this website http://www.efksoft.com/ and download the latest version of iPhone ringtone maker and then install it over your previous version then it will work and you will have a fully activated version of the one that works with the new iphone update"
,LukeM4334,2008-02-01T05:14Z,"Everything worked on the transfer but when i play the ringtone there is no sound, can anybody help?"
,apsi,2008-02-03T04:44Z,"hi, when you do the crack it downgrade the ring tone maker to an older version, and i don't know why but my PC makes an error report when i try to run older version of ring tone maker, but it works fine withe versions 2.0.2 or upper. that  means that i cant get to the registration part  because it doesn't want to run the program when is cracked. can somebody help about this
thanks"
,redmonkey18,2008-02-16T03:44Z,"OK, I got the newer version from the website so that it would work with my version of the iphone (1.1.3).  I also copied the crack, and got the song to transfer to my iphone so I guess it works.  However, I can't seem to find the song in my iphone.  I tried resending it to my phone, but it says that it is already on there.  So my question is, for those of you who got this to work, would you mind telling me where i can find my ringtone in my phone.  It would be very much appreciated =)"
,frankbaje,2008-02-16T04:44Z,"problem here, when i put on the music it is telling me that the song has been put on my phone, and my iphone is syncing, but when i check for the music it is not there....help please?"
,arkalos13,2008-02-29T02:12Z,does this work with any phone or just the iphone?specifically sony ericsson p1i
,choochoo7777,2008-03-02T08:35Z,"this works great.  I have a 16g iphone ..and it puts the ringtones directly on the phone under Custom right on the ringtones page of your iphone.

They apparently WILL NOT show up on Itunes."
,frankbaje,2008-03-03T03:04Z,"well i guess i must be one in a mil, it doesnt work so great for me, there are times when i go to put on tones and it tells me that my iphone isn't connected :S"

,81hotrod,2008-04-24T21:18Z,"I have Vista and it works for me. Follow the directions provided for cracking this version. Then go to the developer's website, click the ""Download"" tab on the top of the page, and download the newer version. Install it. All it will do is update it and it stays cracked."

,Ates1990,2008-05-09T18:32Z,"I did as the instructions told me to do but when I try to start it, it says that i have to enter a serial number, but it didnt work when i wrote something.
What should i do? i have Vista.
(Swedish answer is also good:P)"
,Ates1990,2008-05-09T18:43Z,"oh wait, that was my prob b4. With the crack i can't even open the program?!:S it only closes down with an error.. Could it be because the ""semutil"" file gets an error when i install it?
it says ""Unable to open key ""mp3"" for read"" but even though i could use the trailer version"
,BCFC_Liam,2008-07-16T16:34Z,"Hi, i recently downloaded this programme and i can get the ringtones i have made onto my phone but when i set them as ringtones there is no sound at all and all my iphone does is vibrate 

any help is welcome"
,Crusader66,2008-07-20T16:14Z,"I have the same no sound problem. Maybe it's an issue with the newest iphone update. Crap!
I love my Iphone but I HATE I tunes. Let my phone go! I paid for it but they still own it."
,Crusader66,2008-07-20T16:56Z,I downloaded the newest version of iPhone-Ringtone-Maker and it works fine now. Until the next iphone update.
,stamnoss,2008-08-29T06:43Z,I got a Trojan alert when i downloaded this. Don't remember the name of it cause I removed it right away. So be carefull...
,EricPires9,2008-12-09T17:37Z,"FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S HAVING PROBLEMS:

1. Open the installation file
2. After installation go to the directory
3. Drag-and-release the crack over the directory
4. Open it
5. Go to ""Registration""
6. Put any number in the bar
7. When it says ""Registered"", click on Update
8. Wait it to update and then you can dance in your underwear 'cause now you have iPhone Ringtone Maker for free!!! XD"

,c17fm,2009-02-18T18:15Z,"HERES HOW I MADE IT WORK FOR ME:

The Exe in this torrent froze and didnt work for me so i went a downloaded the trail from there website then i installed it then you take the crack and put into the installation directory and replace the old one with the ""crack"" overwrite the file you find over there with the crack file 
finally launch the crack and it will launch the program and a pop up will appear saying enter reg key
JUST IN PUT ANYTHING!! SUCH AS 1234 HAHA IT WORKS ! ;)

its now full regged =]

,zevrap9999,2009-04-04T14:53Z,"You still have to do the following steps after you make a song. For itunes ver 8

1)- Make a clip of the ringtone- it is saved as .mp3 by default in your ringtones folder in my music
2)- open the ringtone .mp3 clip in itunes
3)- after importing the clip, right click it and save as AAC
4)- locate the song in itunes folders and change the mp3 to .m4r
5) re-import the song into itunes as a ringtone. "
