,voyeurman,2008-01-05T10:21Z,"Roger Ebert """"Tampopo"" is one of those utterly original movies that seems to exist in no known category. Like the French comedies of Jacques Tati, it's a bemused meditation on human nature in which one humorous situation flows into another offhandedly, as if life were a series of smiles.Two Thumbs Up!"""
,voyeurman,2008-01-05T10:25Z,"From DVD cover, ""23 TOP TEN FILM OF THE YEAR LIST during its release year including The New York Times, Time Magazine and Los Angeles Times."""
,voyeurman,2008-01-05T10:30Z,"""Billed as the ""first Japanese noodle western,"" this comedy offers a satirical view of the relationship between food and sex, one of the director's favorite topics. Watch as a widow running a Tokyo restaurant and a cowboy hat-wearing truck driver try to make the perfect bowl of ramen. Highly acclaimed film from director Itami."", synopsis from rottentomatoes.com. 100%   for Critics Tomatometer."

I created this torrent from a (rare) DVD that I ripped.  My wonderful ISP caps my upload at 40 Mb/sec, so until the first downloaders reach 100% you're going to have to all be patient.  Once we tip over the edge & that first wave are seeding, it will be much better.  

Everyone please keep seeding after you get it all!"

Thanks man!!!

Great film! Everyone should watch this!"
,bhobson333,2008-01-11T13:42Z,"I just noticed I have no comments after a lot of people have completed their downloads, & the quality rating is 3 out of 5.  Is there something wrong with it?  I thought it was a perfect UL, a top-quality rip of a movie almost nobody had, except just a few low-res."
,tingvalla,2008-01-20T06:38Z,Thank you. Great to see something different from hollywood movies
,piratloller,2008-04-27T04:30Z,"Also think is good rip, good quality. Movie is original, beautiful, very full."

,Aesteros,2009-03-15T08:55Z,"Thanks so much. I originally saw it in Japanese class, and once I found that renting it caused the rental stores to put a $200+ hold on your credit card in case if you lose it, I came here. I will seed this from now on."
,puppyup,2010-11-15T03:48Z,Thanks a lot! Unfortunately the DVD print isn't really good. So no wonder that the rips out there seem pretty bad. This film needs to be remastered and put on Blueray. Hopefully Criterion will take it in its collection.
