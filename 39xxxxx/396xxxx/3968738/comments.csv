,mladen81,2008-12-30T22:51Z,"Let's solve the mystery surrounding this particular torrent. If you look closely at  0.49.39, you'll notice that suddenly we switch to the scene that really soesn't belong. It lasts for only a couple of seconds but it is enough to totally throw the subtitles off... That's why you should probably avoid this particular torrent. otherwise, a really decent quality... Was this helpful cause it took me some time solving this mystery."

,stjimmy456,2010-03-28T13:48Z,"Quality A/9 V/8

Nothing wrong with this torrent at all, I can't talk about the subtitle complaints because I haven't watched it with subs - but the actual video was perfectly fine.

For about 300mb more, go to the KLAXXON torrent, which is a little larger, but absoltuely perfect quality video.

I'll seed this for the next few days."
