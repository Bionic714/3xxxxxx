,crah,2008-01-15T18:51Z,this seems to be broken cuz i cant mount it with deamon wuz up
,derekw1,2008-01-15T23:08Z,Thanks Fallcore.
,Fallcore,2008-02-15T01:35Z,"Try another mounting tool, but Deamon should work tested on it."
,Layer0730,2008-03-08T14:56Z,"To get the files to mount properly - make sure the cd 1 folder only has cd 1 .mds and . mdf  The same goes with CD 2 (having cd 2 .mds and .mdf)

For some reason the mds files are in CD 1 folder and the mdf files are in the CD 2 folder."
,rbaleksandar,2008-04-01T09:49Z,"It is not working. I mean the No CD crack...I've installed the game (although my antivirus showed me that there is an invader in it...), updated it and overwrote the exe with the NoCD-crack...But it still wants me to put the right CD, although I have mounted both CD1 and CD2 :("
,rbaleksandar,2008-04-01T10:25Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS CRAP! IT IS A VIRUS! I HAVE INSTALLED IT AND AFTER SEVERAL MESSEGASE THAT IT CANNOT FIND THE CD IN THE DRIVE, I DECIDE TO QUIT THE PROCESS FROM THE TASK MANAGER...AND GUESS WHAT? THE PROCESS MONKEY4.EXE WAS APPEARING AND DISAPPEARING EVERY SECOND, SO THAT I COULDN'T TERMINATE THE PROCESS. THEN MY COMPUTER FUCKING RESTARTED AND STARTED IN SAVE MODE!!! I COULD DELETE THE FUCKING EXE-FILE. I UNINSTALLED THE GAME BUT THE EXE REMAINS. I'LL DEAL WITH IT!"
,Fallcore,2008-04-05T04:07Z,"^^^^ Complete and utter Bullshit. And try hitting the Caps Lock you fucking retard. Although my release does not have a virus in it, I do hope you computer is forever fucked up."

,WerthersOriginal,2009-06-07T16:31Z,I'm wondering how many people are downloading this because of the new MI series.
,rebelBodhi,2009-06-17T02:43Z,"who's complaining and writing these ridiculous comments? should be thankful for guys like Fallcore so your cheap asses can leach.  I bought all these gapes years ago (including the 1st when it was first released on DOS), awesome games and can't wait for the new ones from Telltale.  Thanks for the up Fall!"
,CLAUDLUCIFFER,2009-07-21T10:46Z,"aweome game, thx for fallcore for uploading this games, my original cd is damaged and i couldn't recover what left of it, try searching in stores but there are none any, sadly it doesn't  sold anymore in my country. been looking this game ever since.. 
it would be lovely if people who already download this 100% to seed,  im just 10% more to go, and download speed drop to just 10 kBps.."
,staggchilli,2009-08-02T09:37Z,this torrent sucks. dont download it. even if you do manage to get the game running its so glitchy that its almost unplayable
,Homem_do_saco,2009-08-22T23:49Z,Downloading at a wonderfull rate. 5% in 5 min... I'll try it and edit my comment.
,Homem_do_saco,2009-08-24T13:08Z,"Worked Fine. Awsome dl speed, made it in less than 3 hours with a 1megabits connection.
The game works fine, no problems with the crack... The only thing is that the CD's are in the wrong files, just swap the .mdf and the .mds files as Layer said and it will work fine!
The only other problem is the game properly, that isn't one of the bests MI's =/
Keyboard control sucks...
But anyway.... Works fine and its a MI after all...
Thanks"
,deep4ght,2009-11-04T13:09Z,"I love the monkey island games, i've completed them all but i just really wanted to play this one again."
,jakeu2311,2009-11-24T19:38Z,please someone seed waiting ages for this game!!!!!
,thoriz,2011-03-08T20:07Z,"Hey what if you donÂ´t do the two other things you said to do in the readme, the ones after installing the game? Does it make any difference to playing.. I mean it doesnÂ´t seem to."
,Heromist,2011-05-18T03:13Z,"hey when i get done with the DL ill comment again, i didnt know how long MI went on for, they really should make it a Wii game lol or more 3D lol you know better graphics. but people like us dont really care"
,Mozared,2011-07-04T16:46Z,"For those who are having troubles installing this game with their version of windows (installer wouldn't run for me due to my system being 64-bit): google for ""emisetup"" and you'll get a link to a site called ""quick and easy software"" where you can find a custom installer for the game. Use that and mount as usual and everything should be fine =)"
,Miike123,2011-11-26T10:17Z,My mdf file won't go into daemon. I drag it in and it never appears. I've switched the files in the folders around so there the right way but it still doesn't work. Any suggestions??
