,donM250r,2008-01-12T01:17Z,"burn 3 cd iso's
and follow instructions in install.html
works GREAT in Mandriva 2008.0"
,donM250r,2008-01-12T01:23Z,"if anyone else has problems, let me know!
can upload already burnt AND proved working files on CD
NO-CD KEY!
press cancel and continue to play in single-player mode!!!"
,donM250r,2008-01-12T01:37Z,"OOPS!!
forgot 1 thing.
after pressing cancel when asked for key, press ESC
and you're looking at menu for single-player action.
HAVE FUN!!"
,Circuit_breaker,2008-05-30T22:30Z,Can you upload no-cd separately or how does it work?
,eternalillusion,2008-07-20T02:43Z,Works great. I don't know what sfinxdk is talking about. Thanks for the upload!
,ignitz,2009-05-14T07:43Z,"Works great in Ubuntu 9.04
Thanks for uploading... I don't found this game to buy."

,tpbcrazy,2010-08-30T16:26Z,can anyone describe how to install by mounting the ISO w/o actually burning them into cd?
,tpbcrazy,2010-08-30T20:14Z,"ok,installed it but after running doom3 from terminal, i get this error
Unknown command 'vid_restart'
idRenderSystem::Shutdown()
Sys_Error: Couldn't load default.cfg

anyone with help in mind?"
,mematt69,2011-01-02T08:43Z,"try typing ""sudo doom3"" in a terminal. Or.... you could go to the files and make sure the permissions are set properly. This fixed that same issue for myself in Ubuntu 10.10"
