[T],sweetthing,2008-08-21T18:48Z,Has anyone out there in torrent land got the CD of The Untouchable by Alvin Stardust?  I'd like to hear it but don't know if I want to buy it.  I had it on my 13th birthday list in 1974 but got Sweet Fanny Adams and Diamond Dogs instead.  They were probably better presents in reflection but I still wonder what The Untouchable was like.  Any other proper Alvin Stardust CDs would be of interest too.  Not just Hits.
