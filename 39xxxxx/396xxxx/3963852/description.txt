--- Why this torrent? -------------------------------------------------------

First of all, I didn't make this file but I downloaded it from someone else. 
But with a lot of TV series and movies on this site (and others) it was zipped or 
rarred and like most of you I find that very annoying. 
So I made this torrent with the unzipped content and uploaded it here.

There will probably be more....
