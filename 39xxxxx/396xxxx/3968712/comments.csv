I have ABOVE 007, 009, and 011 to 020, so I'm still missing most of the older ones. But I might upload what I've got if no one shows up and seed this one..."

I found same torrent on 6 - 7 different Torrent site places, all have none seeders.. Why share this, and not seed it. I dont get it.. This is ovbiously Part 1 of it, seems like it is a Part 2 of it, and maybe more parts to someplace.. Please those of you got down some of this share it here, so we can get some of it, I will keep searching myself... Would really appreciate any help...

Take Care everyone, and C'ya around.

Best Regards Espen."
