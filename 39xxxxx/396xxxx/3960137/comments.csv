it's the serials that are"
,lotus49,2008-01-04T16:44Z,"You are the asshole JSIT99.  No-one asked you to download this but there are 50 seeders so someone has found it useful.

Furthermore as it says in the description, it is already cracked so you wouldn't need a serial to use this.

Learn some manners you oaf."
,JSIT99,2008-01-04T19:41Z,So there are 50 assholes more
,jaycup,2008-01-04T20:58Z,so funny u guys
,TomKnock,2008-01-05T10:09Z,"JSIT99, there aren't 50 a-holes more, there are 50 people who'd like to have the PRE-CRACKED VERSION as it clearly says in the description. 

There's no need for serials, as this is PRE-CRACKED! Get it?

There's only one a-hole here ..."
,Giancarlo.D,2008-01-06T13:02Z,It works. I was searching for it. Thanks for sharing kopimi. 
,jackdaniels617,2008-02-25T23:19Z,"The other versions + cracks weren't working, this one just worked for me :) Thanks!"
,amenbreak,2008-03-03T14:08Z,n00bs
,Skullpop,2008-06-17T19:52Z,"lol JSIT99, just leave. If you spent a few seconds looking below the comment entry box you'd clearly see that there is 'No serial required' with the 'Precracked' version.

Excellent app, might have to go buy it just to support these developers!"
,knezzy92,2008-08-26T22:40Z,"This Torrent is Great!

Did I mention if you set it to auto download updates, you get the limited beta version of....

CODA 1.5 !!!

Just released today I think. Tons of better features than the original version!

You can search and replace phrases in all files that are open or in a folder. Also, there is SVN support! I unfortunately could not register for this beta in time (yes the beta is closed), but what a treat this was!

Coda DESERVES to be supported, and I pay the developers. I only use this one for the new 1.5 version :D

Happy Coding!"
,mepirate0,2008-08-27T22:11Z,Anyone got a serial for the latest Coda 1.5 ? As soon as I find one I'll post here :)
,knezzy92,2008-08-28T04:57Z,"@ mepirate0

- This version is precracked, no need for a serial.
- Simply download and Run.
- Then go to Coda -> Check for Updates in the menu bar.
- It will then Update to....

Coda 1.5 :D"
,onetwothreefloor,2008-08-28T21:19Z,When I upgraded this to 1.5 it told me my trial had expired...
,knezzy92,2008-08-28T22:42Z,"Sorry to hear that your trial expired.

I never actually evoked the Coda updater, it just did it all on its own. I do believe the default is to ""check for updates automatically"" this could be the problem.

Not sure how it would work out, but I could always post the 1.5 version for you guys.

But of course we all should applaud *kopimi* for this excellent torrent :D

Although I still think coda is worth the $100....considering Dreamweaver is about $32043? hah.... and bloated like crazy, both in code and the actual program."
,knezzy92,2008-08-28T23:06Z,"***WARNING***

Do NOT update to 1.5 make sure your internet is off when running for the first time and then DISABLE the auto-update.

Unfortunately, I see my 1.5 version is indeed the trial version (9 days left in top right corner of window). However, that's fine for me since it is out of beta and a free upgrade for those who purchased it (do it, best IDE ever).

just do NOT update, and you'll have this version (1.1 i think?)

if you do update, it will become a trial again."
[T],nobody2007,2008-09-01T17:05Z,"you got v1.1 via ftp-server original from panic software.

ftp://ftp.panic.com:21//coda/museum/Coda%201.1.zip"
,rush05,2008-09-11T16:42Z,"I found Coda 1.5.1 on Rapidshare

http://vnn.bz/forum/11912-rapidshare-com-coda-1-5-1-plist.html

I'm not able to seed it, as I don't have a computer that I can leave on all the time"
[T],nobody2007,2008-09-20T12:49Z,"@rush05

the Rapidshare file means: cola.zip !!!
Do you think thatÂ´s it what weÂ´re looking for?"
[T],nobody2007,2008-09-20T12:54Z,This file (cola.zip) seems blocked because it should illegal. the provider says so.
,mainefan9802,2008-10-31T15:52Z,"Bullshit!

This version isn't cracked.  

On running the update to 1.5.1 it reverts to 14-day trial.  

Also, none of the serials in the 10-2008 release of Serial Seeker work, either.

Thanks for wasting my time you fat fuck.
