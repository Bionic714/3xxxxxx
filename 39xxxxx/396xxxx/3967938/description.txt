I made this so that all of the members at

could have a verified, working DVD copy of BT3 Beta, pre made and simply only need to click on my ISO to burn. 

This is the EXACT SAME ISO that I used to successfully boot BT3 Beta.

I also added a MD5/SHA checker/maker to make sure whether or not your download is/is not corrupt. ;)
