,j-man246,2008-04-22T10:56Z,"if you loved the original you will HATE this!!!! it is a remake where dorythy is mentally ill. this movie has NO songs and is very dark and frightning. 

DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT IS ALFUL!!! WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!"
,SophieLouise,2008-04-27T11:47Z,"In responce to j-man246. If you have actually took notice of the film you would know that Dorothy isnt mentaly ill, they just think she is. It really is a good film yous should watch it and i have seen the origional i enjoy both of them.

One bad point is that in the first movie dorothy is clearly an older age than the second movie. XD"
,gingerjulian,2008-06-03T17:01Z,"j-man, this isn't a remake in any way.  It's much darker than the original Wizard Of Oz, but I liked it as much as that film.
Thanks for the upload!"
,markisthejob,2008-07-03T18:37Z,This was great.I was a kid when it came out.The wheelers and that woman with all the different heads scared the shit out of me.Ive always wanted to see it again.Thanks
[T],CaptOmerta,2008-07-17T01:32Z,Its a good movie
,ironseas,2008-08-05T21:20Z,"j-man, the movie was nominated for an Oscar, which pretty much automatically makes it not alful. This movie scared me as a kid, and I really want to see this again. I'm glad this is here. Will seed."
,tattoo_junkie,2008-08-08T05:27Z,"I was actually beginning to think I dreamt up this movie. I couldn't find any reference to it, & finally did. I watched it when I was younger & seem to only remember the scene with all the heads.

I cannot wait to watch it again."
,horrorkitty,2008-08-14T12:46Z,"j-man is a twat.

This upload's quality is excellent.  Return To Oz is a classic for those of us born in the 80s.  Thanks hellure!"
,MonkeyGroin,2008-08-16T03:38Z,"J-man is just mad, he was looking forward to acting out his favorite dorothy scenes wearing his dress but got mad when he realised this wasnt a musical for gays, its ok, im sure we can find you something in another torrent to lip sync to wearing your favorite dresses from wizard of oz :)"
,j-man246,2008-11-10T07:23Z,LMFAO Monkeygroin your a funny man but i still keep my opinion that the original WITH THE SINGING is better and this is nothing like it. also i have found another torrent wif singing i like:P its the wiz with diana ross:)
,CowboyBertt,2008-11-16T00:42Z,Complaining that this movie is different than the 70 year old one is like complaining that the Dark Knight is bad because it is not like the 60's Batman TV show. Apples and oranges - two different audiences.
,Lunar_Knight,2008-11-29T02:26Z,"I remember this movie from when it first hit (OMG PPL... get ready for it...) Drive In Theaters. I loved it then, and am looking forward to watching it again. Thx for this one Hellure."
,Dramakus,2008-12-23T09:33Z,This is in no way a remake.  It is a direct sequel in a long line of books fourteen by the original author and a few more after that by various authors.
,Dramakus,2009-01-01T09:53Z,"It is indeed a lot more true to the books than the first movie.  Take a look at this picture (from the original book) and you will see for yourself.

,bratwurstsalad,2009-07-30T04:57Z,"Sorry j-man, maybe it's a bad movie but at least I know how to spell awful."
,hijackit,2009-08-10T03:40Z,"I've always hated ""The Wizard of Oz"" but ""Return to Oz"" was always one of my childhood favorites. J-Man246 is an idiot."
,halfmonkey,2009-10-12T19:41Z,"I know this is a bit old now, but just to clarify a point - This is not a remake of The Wizard of OZ - It is based on another book by Lyman Frank Baum called ""Ozma of OZ"". It is quite faithful to the original text (probably more so than The Wizard of OZ is to the original book by Baum ""The Wonderful Wizard of OZ"". So it's not a sequel, it's a completely different film based mainly on another book in the series of 16 about OZ. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozma_of_Oz#Film.2C_TV_or_theatrical_adaptations"
,darklovetoy,2010-01-04T01:40Z,"does anyone know where I can get a subtitle in English for this version of the movie, I can't seem to find one anywhere that matches it. I found a few on opensubs, and allsubs, but they are awful. I also tried to match with subtitles workshop but I have to edit all the subs because they are full of spelling errors, and unnecessary spaces, characters, etc...."
,g0d,2010-02-15T14:28Z,"I'm sorry, but for a live-action disney movie, this film is actually pretty good. Dealing with profound loss, insurmountable odds, and stick-to-it-iveness without the sickly sweet sappy corn filler.  It's deliciously dark at times and downright laughable at others, but you really do feel yourself compelled by a sense of wonder and i daresay hope for our heroine.

not that i'm a snarky film critic, and i just ran across this film, not actively looking... but i do recall it as one of the films i enjoyed as a child thinking 'this is what film could be'"
,Shadow_Jedi,2010-03-23T13:05Z,"@ hellure and seeders: Thanks a lot for keeping this alive. I loved this growing up. 

FYI, if you haven't heard already. This week in the news the makers of the Harry Potter saga are preparing for their next movie sage...""Oz!"" They are going to follow the books for the most part but with the SPX today I can't wait for Oz to hit the theater for a new generation to fall in love with. "
,viralencore84,2010-06-16T07:45Z, I thought is was good. Who needs senseless songs and crap?
,pwright01,2010-07-03T01:05Z,"this is awesome! the original ""wizard of oz"" isn't all flowers and rainbows either....they don't take a nap,they lay down and ""DIE"" in the poppy field!"
,PaperWar,2010-12-02T00:13Z,"I downloaded a free Audio Book app. on my phone. On the lists of books it has all of the Oz books written by L. Frank Baum. This got me thinking about this one Oz movie that was dark and a little twisted. I thought about how I completely LOVED IT, but could not remember the name. I googled it and there it was ""Return to Oz"". Needless to say I ended up here. Did I mention THANK YOU ALL who have kept this alive. I was afraid that I would find it and it not be seeded. BUT here it is and loading. THANK YOU HELLURE."
,hcake420,2011-04-12T21:05Z,"one of my favorite films of all time. thanks so much! if you liked this i recommend the labyrinth,"
,Apollokun,2011-09-17T06:12Z,"J-Man: If you actually liked the Oz books, you'd love this movie. But you obviously don't. So shoo."
,Apollokun,2011-09-17T06:13Z,"BTW Hellure, thank you for the excellent upload. I love this film so much, and always have, and always will. When I have kids (when I'm old enough to have them, that is), I will undoubtedly share this classic with them. Thank you again, and namaste."
,j-man246,2011-10-25T07:18Z,"I withdraw all my previous comments. This film is obviously directed at a different audience to the original. Granted i enjoy the original more than this ""sequel"" it is still a great movie nevertheless. I cannot believe how narrow minded i was :| By the way everyone should download a movie called The crow.
