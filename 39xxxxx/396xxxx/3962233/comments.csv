,deloder,2008-01-07T03:26Z,"hey this comment is not about this seeder;;;
last night have downloaded ""Hitman DVD RIP XviD-SHoCK-VCD"" ;;; nothing but shit ;;;; how come an asshole upload this sort of shit which is not even compactable and the shit is advertising for a website ;;; moderators what the hell r u doing ;;; now it hope lesss '''i was proud to be with pirate bay but not any more ''' and i miss u axxo"
,pearljamaussie,2008-01-07T04:42Z,"Deloder, its because you dont know what your doing basically, no offence. they cant download every single file that gets put up and see if its fake, and axxo is just a rip off of other peoples work compressed to fit 700 meg is all. Learn to notice certain groups and maybe try review sites like RLSLOG on quality and the scene group thats actually released the title. If it has a sample, check that first perhaps. I highly recommend you use the site RLSLOG for a review on the REAL copies of whats available, you got sucked in by the ""DVD RIP"" in the title, plenty of people do, all i can say again is RLSLOG has been my saviour and havent got a bogus file for the last year! When you find the real deal, come back here and search for that exact title and add pirate bay tracker.

Top work again FXG, cheers."
