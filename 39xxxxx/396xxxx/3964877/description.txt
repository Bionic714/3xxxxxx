I have seen this show listed by just very few collectors in all the years....guess this will
change now as the gig appeared on a vinyl bootleg callesd "Cunning Stunts". This package
also included a copy of the show on CD-R which I have used to make this torrent.

This is onbe of the shows AC/DC played as support for Black Sabbath.
Pretty good quality for an audience recording from 1977 !

Enjoy !
