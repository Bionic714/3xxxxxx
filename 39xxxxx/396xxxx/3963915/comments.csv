,dechamp,2008-01-07T01:54Z,"Does this require a Dual Core CPU, or can it run on a fast P4?"
,ArcaynE,2008-01-07T03:51Z,"You can run it on a fast P4, but you must select SSE2\SSE3 in the menu..  Also, you will have to run patched kexts and kernel updates.

With a Core 2 Duo\Quad, you can run the actual Apple files and updates, without the need for all the hassles..  

SO, you CAN do it on P4, but Core 2 would be MUCH better in performance and usability."
,shyperson,2008-01-09T03:16Z,(this should also solve the instant reboot problems on non-Intel motherboards) you mean that i can run it on my AMD computer.
,ArcaynE,2008-01-09T23:01Z,"YES, you can run this on AMD, just make sure NOT to use EFI emulation and choose SSE2/SSE3.  For an install guide, go to http://uphuck.ggrn.de/forum/ , register on the site, and click iATKOS.  in there, there is a stickied post with an install guide. 

Hope this helps =D"

,rbsfou,2008-01-11T23:35Z,"I am SICK AND TIRED of ARSEHOLES clogging up the forums with pathetic posts about not being able to extract, burn or run something that is obvious to those with just a LITTLE experience at these things.

Whatever happened to look before you leap? I'm sure the IT department where you work love you. In fact, i bet you are there boss :P

It's a hybrid ISO/HFS+ Filesystem, you will probably NOT see any files from windows, but you would if you had Macdrive installed or had a clue about analysing CD images with Linux.

What is truely sickening however is that after realizing your mistake you didn't even apologise for your earlier tantrum (which in itself was unjustified).

I'd just like some people in the future to TRY THINGS OUT before posting awful messages like this."

,crapthecrocodile,2008-02-25T14:45Z,"so darwin install is automatic? That means you can skip these steps:

12. Now close this disk utility and click on Utilities->Darwin_Boot

13. Click on the terminal, to activate the cursor and type Y.

14. When it asks for disk no press 1

15. When it asked for partition no press x+1

Note: x is the partition no in windows and x+1 is that in MAC OS. So if it was Partition 3 in windows and disk0s4 in MAC OS then you should type 4

16. Click Y and Y. If its succesful, you will get a message saying so.. So and so blocks copied blah blah etc. and Process completed at the end.

17. Close this window and then close the terminal.

right? "

dude, DEmaster...this is an operating system. an operating system cant exactly fry your memory, cpu, or gpu, like you appear to be claiming.


+ ive run quite a few of these cracked mac versions [[iatkos, leo4all, kalyway, etc etc]] and NEVER had a problem with it ""bombing my hard drive"" or anything.  

and for the record, even if it fucked your hard drive, guess what? simply re-formatting it in the windows xp or vista setup [[or whatever os you want to revert to]], would fix the problem.
