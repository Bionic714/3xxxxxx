,stefansz,2008-01-13T22:29Z,"IMPORTANT !
For Updating product after serial number is gone,... after a month you can still have the updates from Sophos Website,... just download them and install them in Program files Folder where the software is installed 

=========================
http://www.sophos.com/downloads/ide/
Download latest virus identity (IDE) files 
If you are running an older version of Sophos Anti-Virus and do not automatically update your protection with EM Library, you should download virus identity files (IDEs), which provide detection and disinfection of viruses, worms, Trojans and spyware.

All the IDEs you need are available in a single compressed file. The file is available in two formats: a Zip file or a self-extracting file. Files are updated every time we release protection for a new virus.
