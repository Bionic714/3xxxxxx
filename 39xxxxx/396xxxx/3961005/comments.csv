,Moppsta,2008-01-08T06:25Z,"File downloaded and works alright, but I can't seem to capture anything past 2 minutes. Is that normal?"
,CreativeMan,2008-01-08T19:15Z,"Hi,

No it's not normal, znd it's working fine on my three comps... Do you have installed before the demo version ?

Bye,
"
,Moppsta,2008-01-09T04:47Z,"Yeah I had the demo before, but I uninstalled it before I downloaded this."
,zomgkittylazerz,2008-01-10T04:57Z,"NOD32 detects a virus, but AVI and Norton don't."
,zomgkittylazerz,2008-01-10T04:57Z,^Actually AVG does too.
,CreativeMan,2008-01-10T10:39Z,"Hi,

What's the point to say it is virused and not telling what virus is detected inside ?
Re-scanned the whole thing with BD 2008 and with F-Secure, nothing found. So please when you find a virus, post what virus is suspected to be into it so it would be easier to find if or not the files are infected.


Bye,

,FiLLLipO,2008-01-11T18:27Z,"Great uploadxD   But when ive opens the program does it comes up a window there it stands ""Open Whith"" Whath program shall i use???"
,CreativeMan,2008-01-13T09:51Z,"Hi,

Download WinRAR from rarlab.com and then you'll be able to uncompress the .rar and install the program.

Bye,

,dkdynamik,2008-01-31T23:07Z,"seriosuly,,, why is somebody claiming this file has virus. Its perfectly working - NO VIRUSSES. Though have just bought the newest version (dollar exchange rate low :D) and the newest version runs a bit more smooth in Vista."
,UserU,2008-02-02T07:52Z,I need some help. Most of my torrents stop at 99% though its complete. This torrent finishes at 96% and its done but i still see that the setup might be unfinished. How to solve this problem?
