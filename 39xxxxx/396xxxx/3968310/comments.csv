,hopesend,2008-12-12T03:55Z,"I know this playlist is almost a year old, but I thought it was cool that Building Rome is on here.  I'm the female vocalist on that track."
,beyachan,2009-11-21T02:39Z,"Hi Criznittle! Thanks for all these awesome playlists. I don't suppose you have all of the album 'Wisely', do you? That song you put on here, ""Cracked World View"" is amazing, and I really want some more of that guy's music, but I can't find it anywhere. (Also, if you have ""Wisely Life: Tokyo Doki-Doki"" too, that would be awesome.)"
