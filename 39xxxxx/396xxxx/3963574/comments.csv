,hooghlyrocks,2008-02-10T17:00Z,"yeah website above has some of my ringtones, happy for them to publish them all.....  :0)"
,hooghlyrocks,2008-05-19T17:42Z,"t_reign: LOL - what an idiot you are.
Tell me where I can find these M4R files?  I cna find SOME of the same sound bites on here but think....  and LOOK FULLY at the listing of what is there.
Yes some of these were not originally released by myself.  However EVERY SINGLE ONE was collected individually over years.  Some of them are from the Chewin' the Fat website, some are random WAV's that people have emailed me.  The remainder are ALL MY OWN WORK.

Countdown - I recorded this off of the TV
Family Guy - again off the TV
Ring Ring Ring - from one of my Sony Ericcson phones that I could not bear to be without
Scott Mills, Bottle of Wine - from BBC Radio One, home recording
World, Have Your Say - this is the PiĂ¨ce de rĂŠsistance, this is MY mate on a Radio show, this one is HIS ringtone for when HE calls me.

So, to close - are these all my ringtones?  Yes, I made them into the final format that you see them in today.  Are they all my own work?  No but I did put a load of time into them so that they would work on the iPhone.

Can I call them ""My Ringtones""  FUCK YEAH - They are on my phone, some of them are 100% mine....  still does not stop me wanting to share!

t_reign: what are you sharing?  Looks like SWEET FA!!!  LOL"
,hooghlyrocks,2008-05-19T17:45Z,"t_reign: forgot to mention the ""To Fat to be Gay"" - I ripped that from an MP4 episode of the Simpsons, lemme know your number and I will set it to be your ring tone!  hehe"
,jferth,2008-07-03T00:42Z,Appreciate the work you did compiling all of these! Thanks!

,SeedLeechPirate,2009-12-22T03:46Z,"hi hooghlyrocks. These are pretty funny ringtones, first of all thanks for uploading.

I do have a question, I uploaded these onto my Sony Ericsson phone, and I can use them as ringtones just fine. 
But I can not use them as Message alert tones.
it gives me the message: ""can not use file"". 
Message alert tones need to be .dcf (which is some kind of sony ericsson .wav type of sound format). I can't seem to find any way to convert them so I can use them as message alerts.

Not a real big deal, I'm just looking around for anyone to help me or point me in the right direction.

I have the program called ""switch"" which converts any audio file into any possible audio format. But its unable to create .dcf files.

Do you have any idea? If not thats cool!

Thanks again for the tones :)

,hooghlyrocks,2010-02-15T11:49Z,"Hey SeedLeechPirate

My partner uses a SonyEriccson and for ages had more than one of these M4A version of the files as message alert tones - maybe your model does not support M4A as message alerts...  odd - you might want to see if any of your friend have another SE model that you can do some testing on?

Never heard of the format .dcf, I also use switch to change the format but I know what you would use to generate them?  Maybe some SE software?"
,hooghlyrocks,2010-02-15T11:49Z,"Oh and.... check these out - about 40 odd more....
