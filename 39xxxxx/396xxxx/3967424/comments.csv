,tonith,2008-03-04T09:08Z,How do I get the subtitles to work :S?
[T],_Maelstrom_,2008-03-07T07:41Z,"That depends on how you are playing the file.

For instance, if you are on Windows and playing the video in WMP you have to install VobSub/VSFilter (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82303&package_id=84359). Then extract the subtitles from the rar into the same folder as the videos.

Alternately you can install VLC Player (http://www.videolan.org/vlc) which comes with all necessary playback filters and can be run on most any OS."

,overwhelming333,2008-07-17T16:50Z,"why is it that when i played it no sound came out?
and yes the speakers were turned on"
,cherryrosa,2008-07-21T02:21Z,"don't worry, it'll just be the codec, just find an updated codec pack using google and then all your video files should play fine"
,Jwitt5,2008-12-16T05:00Z,"i'm a bit confused about the codec thing.  I know I probably sound like a moron, but I'm not all that familiar with these things.  We've all been there; could someone help me?"
,BlueFdg,2009-01-02T18:52Z,"@Jwitt5: get Videolan VLC player. It plays everything, it's free and opensource. Get it from the official site http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"
