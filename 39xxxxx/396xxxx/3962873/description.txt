Plotline:

Four college students travel deep into the Florida Everglades to earn some extra credit for their biology class. Little do they know, the reason they're there is not to research eels; their professor has created a genetically modified super-eel, and they must capture it, or kill it. Meanwhile, Dr. Soren's old friend, Delmar, is also on the trail of the eel, while Delmar's ex, the sheriff, is chasing after two escaped convicts. When all of these groups converge, the results are exciting... and deadly!
