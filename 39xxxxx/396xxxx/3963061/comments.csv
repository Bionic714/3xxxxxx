,highpark,2008-01-08T04:29Z,"I'm glad to have it, thanks,   but its probably the worst quality Ive have seen in a divx screener,, it's jerky and slightly blurry.    BUT,, very happy to have it, watched the whole thing, works."
,TheChadMan,2008-01-09T17:59Z,"as i said, its a production copy, the quality isn't brilliant, but i don't think it was supposed to get out onto the internet.. it's still watchable and it's better than a camera rip.........."
