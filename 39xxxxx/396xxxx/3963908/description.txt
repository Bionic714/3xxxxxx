The Shamen were an experimental electronic music band, initially formed in Aberdeen, Scotland by Colin Angus (b. 24 August 1961), Derek McKenzie (b. 27 February 1964), Keith McKenzie (b. 30 August 1961) and Peter Stephenson (b. 1 March 1962) in the 1980s as a psychedelic-influenced indie rock act. They found underground credibility as an acid house act and pioneers of rock/dance crossover, before moving on to international commercial success with "Ebeneezer Goode" and the Boss Drum album.
