,Hemmotus,2009-02-08T22:27Z,Seeding would be very kind...
,drg0nzo,2009-11-07T21:28Z,If you can't figure out how to open rar files you don't deserve to use PB.
,Joker1974,2010-02-08T10:55Z,"I think what SteamRadio meant, drg0nzo, is that there's no way to view the file list of an uploaded RAR file.  I'm not a fan of compressed files either, really.

Many thanks for the nice UL and the track listing though, Lucifer :)"
