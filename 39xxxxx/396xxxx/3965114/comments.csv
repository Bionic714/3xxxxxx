,Skwigz21,2008-04-28T06:14Z,Why did you scan the ads??
,deadpool1205,2008-05-22T06:15Z,"why do you care that they scanned the ads? if anything its one less reason for the comic makers to be mad at us for illegally reading and duplicating their comics.. at least there advertisers will still get further reach, so the money from them is less likely to go down"
