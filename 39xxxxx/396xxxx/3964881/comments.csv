,Netzach,2008-01-06T23:57Z,Eh. Wasn't CS3 the first version that had native Intel support?
,nottheold,2008-01-07T07:44Z,yep - im pretty sutre it was ans still is......
,scottyarch,2008-01-07T13:31Z,"There was a semi-update to the Creative Suite while it was still officially 2 that made some of the apps Universal Binary but Photoshop wasn't one of them, it didn't get released as a UB app until the public beta for CS3.

So those of you who are interested don't download this because it's not an Intel app (not unless this one guy did what Adobe didn't) which, for me at least, throws the rest of it into the area of the highly suspect.

Besides, CS3 runs brilliantly on Intel macs and you can get a volume serial that means you don't have to activate at all. Ever. With full updates and no cracks.

Hmmmm hard choice to make..."
,gallou10,2008-01-07T13:42Z,"The Keygen application to crack Photoshop only works on Intel Mac, so... you can install it on normal MAC but can't crack it."
,scottyarch,2008-01-07T20:52Z,"Uh... Doesn't that defeat the purpose then? CS3 doesn't run quite as well on a PPC as CS2 when it comes to certain operations but on an Intel mac CS3 is amazingly faster. And easier to get, you can download a trial off Adobe's website and just put in a volume serial and you're good to go."
,cuddarat,2008-01-07T21:37Z,"CS3 doesn't have ImageReady though, and I'm betting that this does. BEST way to make web navigation graphics."
,echoingmind,2008-01-17T23:28Z,When I attempt to download this l receive only a 40kb file titled Adobe.Photoshop.CS2.Mac.Intel.3964881.TPB.torrent What am I doing wrong? can anyone help me? This occurs on all torrents. I own an intel mac.
,digitaldevil,2008-01-20T22:42Z,"echoingmind-- .torrent files are always very small. You need a torrent client program (if you're on a mac, try azureus or transmission). I use transmission, it's a decent client, uses very little memory and small (like 4mb). Download it (search on google to find it, only download it from its home page!), install it, open it, and then drag and drop .torrent files onto it. Torrent files just act as guides for torrent clients telling them what file(s) to download from which tracker. Transmission will open the .torrent file and start downloading the much much bigger file that it refers to."
,miranova,2008-01-28T23:40Z,"oh crap..this says intel. i have a powebook g4.  is this why i can't use crossover or get a key code? this is my first time torrent'in.

Thanks for the GREAT app.
Installs fine (if you just follow the simple instructions) and runs perfectly on Intel Macs!
THANK YOU!"
,Kipnugget,2008-03-06T18:09Z,"Works perfectly, but if you don't have an Intel Mac just have a friend run the keygen, that's what I did."
,Macboyleopard,2008-03-16T08:30Z,"the easiest thing to do is: go to http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/ and download the trial and then put the

Any ideas?"
,theglockner,2008-07-17T18:54Z,"Oh, and I'm trying to run this on my MacBook Pro with Leopard."
,skitinternet,2008-07-19T12:21Z,"installed on a intel core 2 duo, macbook 2,4 mhz on leopard.

""An error occurred during installation, a required file is missing""

,PlumDiddly,2008-08-16T07:28Z,"Hello all,  tried to use cross over on my intel mac wt leo but can't get crossover to run the keygen, i have 27 days to activate and am not sure what i have done wrong. when i double click on keygen it opens cross over but then does nothing... little help please..."
,therealseraph,2008-08-31T22:00Z,"No good!
Serial number has had maximum number of activations. Game over.

Great waste of time & bandwidth."
,dmreiman,2008-09-15T04:50Z,"when you click activation options and then click activate by telephone it brings up the window the installation instructions refer to but i dont see any 'request code'.  i only see two telephone numbers, a serial number and an activation number.

anything im doing wrong?"
,eleitl8,2008-10-28T06:14Z,"I can't make crossover work. I got an message telling me to use my Max os x cd. So, I did run it, but after that nothing happend. It wont open the keygen.. Can someone help me?"
,1zuel,2008-11-04T23:47Z,Can Someone sand it plz?
,cocoloco2000,2009-01-12T16:03Z,cs2 keygen
,thenotorius1,2009-02-15T19:12Z,where is the request code? i cant find it at all!!
,thenotorius1,2009-02-15T19:23Z,i got it.. feels good to finally get it done..quick question tho should i update or not?
,tomatyyyy,2009-03-25T15:14Z,"people are having problems with the 'request code'. the request code is actually just the activation number. in order for this number to work in the keygen however, you have to type dashes or hyphens between each set of four numbers, e.g 1234-5678 etc the cross over program takes a while to load. you haveto manually select the cs2 keygen file and it then has to create a new bottle, but it works eventually. Im running an IMac with 10.5."
,yesohyes,2009-06-23T18:32Z,"Works great on my Mac Book Pro 10.5.7.
Thanks a million dude."
,geruel,2009-10-04T07:20Z,"I tried it, and the same error happened to me just like notfranz, can anyone help me pls"
,omenonemron,2010-03-19T01:06Z,"So far, so good!!! It took me a little effort to make it through the installing instructions, but it worked well in the end. Now I just need to learn how to use it. Hey Gallou10, Thank You Very Much!!!"
,hendrixtheman,2010-09-06T14:38Z,"HEY! for those who tried to activate and didn't work. The keygen works on windows that's why you cannot open it on mac. So, easy: You install the app and follow all those steps provided. When you have the activation board in front of you (the phone one) you can run Parallels or VMFusion to open Windows, so you will be able to open the keygen using windows. if you don't have any of them you keep the activation code on a paper, and use bootcamp. In the worst cases you have to use a pc to open the keygen. Put the keygen in a pen drive, past it to any pc desktop and launch it. Then write the activation code and it will give you the authorization code. Is that ok?"
,kristoferi,2011-01-17T21:17Z,"I cant find the request code, where is it?"
,GraphicDesigner15,2012-04-02T10:03Z,The Keygen Doesn't Work. It won't let me install it. If you can give me an Activation Code that will be brill.....
