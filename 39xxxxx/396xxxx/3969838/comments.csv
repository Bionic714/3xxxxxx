,cx420ns,2008-01-19T23:19Z,"do a search for Power CD+G, karaoke disc burning software. think there is a torrent here. wish more than 19 songs could be put on a disc though."

@ghelmz2000 - I'm not sure if you can burn CDG files to a dvd and watch them on a normal DVD player because you need a CDG player (which look like DVD players) to read the lyrics file.

For karaoke, I use Swift Elite 4 (available on here) and run it through my TV with S-Video. Hope this helps. Cheers!"
