 Bourne is once again brought out of hiding, this time inadvertently by       
 London-based reporter Simon Ross who is trying to unveil Operation           
 BlackBriar--an upgrade to Project Treadstone--in a series of newspaper       
 columns. Bourne sets up a meeting with Ross and realizes instantly they're   
 being scanned. Information from the reporter stirs a new set of memories,    
 and Bourne must finally, ultimately, uncover his dark past whilst dodging    
 The Company's best efforts in trying to eradicate him.
