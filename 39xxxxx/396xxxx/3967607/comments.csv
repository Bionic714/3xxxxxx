This is Dr Carl Sagan narrating. He reminds me of Agent Smith from the Matrix.

Dr. Steven Hawking is crippled and uses a computer synthesized voicebox to talk for him. 
But his computer generated voice doesn't appear here in this audio book.
He, however, lent his computer voice to the Pink Floyd song ""Keep Talking"", and ironically has done many voice-over work for TV shows like the simpsons, usually poking fun at himself!"
