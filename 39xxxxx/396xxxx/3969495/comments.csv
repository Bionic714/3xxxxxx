,web_king,2008-02-13T18:03Z,A pity you shrinked it. Bad quality from the beginning just got worse for no reason at all. Otherwise thanks for sharing :-)

do you have the captain log set"
,thompscd2410,2008-11-01T04:51Z,for everyone complaining about the episodes. they should look at what this really is. These are picked by fans and members of the show. this is not a complete set of every time travel episode it is the star trek collective as released by paramount pictures.
