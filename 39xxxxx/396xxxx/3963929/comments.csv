,fragomatic,2008-02-03T02:11Z,"OH MY GOD. This torrent is OFF THE HOOK!!! The beats are mind blowing. I very rarely alt+tab to go back on piratebay and write reviews, but this torrent is INSANE!!!! HOLY F*ck!!! I'm not sleeping toning, gona mix music ALL night!!!"
,fragomatic,2008-02-03T02:16Z,"My gosh, if they invented a machine that could pull out the exact sound your brain wants to hear at this very moment in my life, well, i don't need that machine because i have 5 CDs of the best f*cking music i have ever heard, it sounds as if it came straight out of my deep desires and imagination!!!! HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommended torrent. Out of this world beats!!!! Download it. And if your a DJ, you could expect to move up a few points of the DJ popularity board, people will die of fatigue dancing on these beats!"
