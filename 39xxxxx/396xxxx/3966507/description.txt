 After returning to Hogwarts to begin his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry       
 Potter discovers that much of the wizarding world, including the Ministry    
 of Magic, is in denial about Lord Voldemort's return. The Order of the       
 Phoenix, a group sworn against Voldemort, is using its vast array of         
 wizards and witches magical abilities to combat Voldemort. Cornelius Fudge,  
 Minister for Magic, suspects that Dumbledore is using these claims of The    
 Dark Lord's return as a means to over-throw Fudge as Minister. In            
 retaliation, a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher is appointed by     
 the Ministry in order to keep an eye on Hogwarts. This new teacher,          
 Professor Umbridge, implies strict new teachings and rules, forcing a group  
 of students, under the tutelage of Harry, to form a club, by the name of     
 Dumbledore's Army
