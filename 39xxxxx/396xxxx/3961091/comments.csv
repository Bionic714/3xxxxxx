,madmax999,2008-09-29T10:29Z,"Maybe not so rare now.  Paul Newman dies and suddenly every one of his films that I have here has 20 seeders - lol.  Including this very little known one.

I'm glad that I had them here to be available to the great crew of TPB.

We lost a great one this month.  Unlike so many actors today, he had class."
