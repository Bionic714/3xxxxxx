Hard to find.  Interesting Paul Newman film.  Good character development, but not a lot of action. I always enjoy it, it always puts my wife to sleep.

Wide screen, avi format, DVD rip, english only, no subs.  Excellent quality.


During a future ice age, dying humanity occupies its remaining time by playing a board game called "Quintet." For one small group, this obsession is not enough; they play the game with living pieces ... and only the winner survives.
