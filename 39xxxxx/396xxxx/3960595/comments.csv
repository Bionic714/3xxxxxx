,JSIT99,2008-01-04T12:11Z,"It's really poor on mac compared to DEMONOID, TPB i understand why they're is no ratio and 80% of shit eccept for tv shows"
,JSIT99,2008-01-04T12:12Z,I had this version when it came out on DEMONOID???
,denis77,2008-01-04T12:21Z,"Yep ! thanks for the Share, excelent App' for sure.

One, thing : Why the keygen is an ""EXE"" file, MAC OSX can't run EXE file ! only PC'S Win....

I see have 2 file : 1 DMG...that one ok...and the Keygen : EXE !!!!

Thanks for reply,

Regards,

Denis"
,psykozz,2008-01-04T14:08Z,"Yes, DEMONOID was the best torrent site!...

To denis77: Some Mac app have only PC's KeyGen...
You must use Virtual PC (on PPC Macs) or Parallels Desktop (on Intel Macs) or a Windows PC to use it...
We need more cracker on Mac! ;-)

You can also use this serial number (find on Demonoid when I have downloaded this great app):

Name: team@vrl.com
Serial: Z4C5-KFSN-MC9Y-76MC"

Yep you totaly right concerne Demonoid & Mac Appli's...
I hope dem' re_opened soon, cause like all the Mac_Users say ( and me to lol ) we haven't any place now without dem'.

Anyway, Pirate bay is today...our sanctuary...

,hoycegracie2k,2008-01-04T20:57Z,"so the question you have to ask is, where are all the folks that used to post mac stuff on demonoid posting to now? Why not TPB?"
,DEATHMOVE,2008-01-05T00:16Z,because they're still crying and can't get round the loss of their shite torrent site?

,gologango,2009-04-23T04:07Z,"or you could just use 
Crossover, but you gotta make
a bottle so its a little complicated 
just messing around normally works with
it
