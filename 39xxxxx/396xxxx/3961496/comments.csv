,Strohbie,2008-02-19T06:34Z,This is great.  Thanks so much!
,mecano,2008-04-19T16:21Z,"I'm only counting 29 tracks for season 1. I miss the first track ""prologue"". 
But thanx for the rest. Even though season 3 is only 160kb. I've found a genuine 320kb already on usenet."
,DiamondBollocks,2008-06-23T05:21Z,Excellent upload! Great soundtracks from a great show - Cheers!
,MissBlue,2008-10-23T12:40Z,Thank you!
,irmed,2008-10-24T09:02Z,"Hi all,

The files that I have work great and sound good.  The only problem is that I seem to be stuck at 99.1% download, but I have been downloading for a while and the percent hasn't changed. My ""BT Client Connect Status"" dot is lit green.  So what's the deal? Anyone with more experience than I can help suggest an answer to what is going on.  I had the same problem with another completely different file.  Thanks."
,irmed,2008-10-25T01:32Z,"WTF man???!!! Why am I not getting 100% of the file?! I'm stuck at 99.1% and it keeps downloading for hours with green dots.  I think what is happening is that I am somehow downloading other stuff for other people, and I'm never getting this complete file because people are F@#king hackers!"
,foo10019,2009-03-24T17:27Z,Agree with illegalprelude.  You're a lying fucktard.  Season 3 is showing a crystal shit 160kbps.
,Dhatz,2009-04-03T18:28Z,i fucken love the song when the cylon finds CYLON writtenn on the mirror in 01x07
,ryan32533,2009-04-12T05:32Z,"Great songs, all I can say is, when do we get season 4?  That would frakkin wrap it up."
,dadpoet,2009-06-22T12:18Z,"It's a good question. I'm curious too. If somebody knows, when it comes, please share with us!!! Thanks"
,icelaw,2009-06-23T17:20Z,"I like my music to be complete and with max on the quality. 
Lossless (.Flac) is the best way.

On another torrent i found that,
compare the 606mb with the torrent i linked that is on 1,25GB. Better.

,icelaw,2009-06-23T17:24Z,"By ayy this ain' so bad either! 
if you don't wanna spend 1,25GB space on that music this torrent is the best choice."
,Grenadeh,2009-07-14T12:23Z,"The difference is that Lossless is a pointless waste of time and space and no good media player for any system actually supports it out of the box, nor with any plugins. So use MP3s like everyone else with common sense. You literally can't tell the difference between a lossless and an mp3 even with the best speakers ever made."
