Worcester, MA\'s own Killing Pablo bring their first official release, this 6 song e.p., to 75orLess Records... just over 30 minutes of feedback laden anarchistic art rock. Recorded with George Dussault at Galilee Studios, Pop Songs For Assholes mixes together a myriad of influences (Dinosaur Jr, Mogwai, Lightning Bolt, the MC5, Glenn Branca and everything inbetween) to create a style that is both a contemplative reverb-drenched drone and ear-bleeding sonic terrorism.
