# Synopsis: As a dedicated follower of Christ, Peter spreads the message of the Christians across the land, often staying only one step ahead of those determined to persecute him. As the tension between the Christians and the Romans grows, blood runs in the streets and the apostles lose St. Paul to crucifixion. On the road to Damascus Peter comes face-to-face with a stranger who shows him the only way - he must put himself on the cross in order to bring peace to Rome.
