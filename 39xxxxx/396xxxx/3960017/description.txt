From MobyGames:

In this game you are Duncan - a man who must save the worlds of Dream and Reality from dark force. World of dreams allows you, for example, to fly between islands in the sky or to make your clone. You will encounter some peaceful creatures, who can talk to you and help you with your quest, and evil ones, who want to take away your will and must be killed. So you jump and run your way through the ancient land in search for the well of mankind's dreams.

This game is extremely rare and hard to find on the net. (Not anymore) :D
I think this fact alone is enough for downloading.
