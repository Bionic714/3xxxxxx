,beatnick,2008-01-25T12:47Z,Anyone else experiencing huge problems with freezes and crash to desktop when playing this game under windows 98?
,meytipeyti,2008-03-11T20:21Z,"It does not install on XP.
Do not waste your time and bandwidth downloading this."
,luizfalves,2008-04-08T04:08Z,it does install on winxp. don't waste time reading comments from people who think what happens to them will happen to the whole world.
,emka438,2008-04-09T13:40Z,"Well, it happened to me too. 
When i choose a disk to install I get message ""Caution! Insufficient space to copy the files to the hard disk. Please select another drive or make room"". Needless to say there's plenty of free space... What should I do?"
,luisnash,2008-05-19T01:19Z,"Hey, gotta say i have the same problem as emka438...the insufficient space stuff...
any solutions for this?"
,luisnash,2008-05-19T01:23Z,"also, this keeps showing up when i try to install : ""windows - no disc
exception processing message c00013 parameters (lots of numbers and letters)""

did anybody have this problem?"
,Tenrius,2008-08-12T10:57Z,"About problem with insufficient space: this game requires to install [u]less[/u] than 2 Gb of freespace . Specifics of Win98, you know. Just create new local drive with less than 2 Gb freespace and install the game here (or install the game to any local drive which has less than 2 Gb of freespace)."

,gigser,2009-12-17T18:24Z,I've been seeding this wonderful game for almost 2 months and I will continue to do so for the sake of it being plain wonderful. Although it seems to have an awful lot of bugs if played on windows 7.
,pietjeruk,2010-01-30T20:03Z,"hi, first of all thank you very much for this game, it's one of the best games ever made!!!

I have windows 7 too, it has got bugs that's true. Here's a solution: every time your game hangs press alt+f4 to close the error message you get and your game continues. sometimes you get 2 errors messages so you have to have to press 2 times alt + f4.

,aLTaR_07,2011-03-24T07:35Z,Seed seed seed pls :)
,Sagara_Shinji,2011-04-08T10:42Z,"THUMBS UP!

Was looking for this game for quite some time already and was for giving up, that's when found this!

Thumbs up! Just two seeders, but at high uploading rate, so in 3h downloading at 102 kbps I'm getting Dreams to Reality! :D"
,butterick,2012-03-06T20:31Z,"Thx! Just completed the game for the second time, first time l played this game was in 1998.

Here is some tips for you guys under windows 7 x64. 

1. Download and unpack/install Taewoong's Dosbox dated 20120111.

2. Install the game in Dosbox using command: Instalfx

3. Start playing in Dosbox using the command: dreamsfx

The game is still glitchy and has tons of bugs but l enjoyed it very much nonetheless. You can always load the game using the many autosaves."
