The King is back in action in the underground, at least. This isn't live from T.I.'s crib or nothing, but you'll definitely feel T.I. talking to the people with this new joint. Giving you almost completely unheard and unreleased material from T.I. and T.I.P., respectively, this new official underground compilation of Rubberband Man music is that straight 'Bankhead Ambassador' sh*t. 

Mixed by P. Smizzy and his man Got Now, this CD is bringing you more than 15 exclusive records in total, including music that didn't make 'T.I. vs. T.I.P.' you know this is that straight Leak sh*t coming from the vaults of the (urban) legendary trapstar. PLUS...A TRACK YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS - Go inside T.I.'s head on "The Life" as he questions his judgement in the recent situation he's found himself in, talking about the situation and what he's facing...all over a bangin' 'Hotel CA' sample.
