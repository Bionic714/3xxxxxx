Hey everyone, here's the season 4 finale.  Last Tuesday was New Year's day, so there was no episode on Showcase.  They were playing movies all night.  I suppose the fat-suit episode may have been aired on the Friday night 'repeat' timeslot, but I forgot to tune in.  Although up until last night, showcase.ca was advertising the fat episode as airing tonight, so who knows.  Hopefully it'll get shown again soon.
