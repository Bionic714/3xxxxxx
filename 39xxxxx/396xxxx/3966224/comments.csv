,Droploader,2008-07-07T20:30Z,"This is the best copy for an English subs, it is audio descriptive but it follows perfectly.
High quality audio and picture. Brilliant film btw."

,Morkhun,2008-07-23T22:36Z,"I'm sure the subs are great, but please: why hardcoded? :S"
[T],MrLore,2008-07-30T09:34Z,"Morkhun, I have hard coded the subs because this is how the film is shown in all English speaking countries and hardcoded subs look better in contrast to the video."

,mictrmbl,2009-01-01T09:09Z,"Video=8.9/10
Audio=9.8/10

A very good copy indeed. In low light scenes, the video does get extremely murky, but there aren't too many of these scenes. The audio is just fantastic. My surround system got a really good workout. Just imagine, being in that bunker surrounded by the constant barrage of shelling. Sometimes I felt like I was in the middle of this horrific turmoil. The movie does come with English subtitles hard-encoded; all you have to do is just click play. My complaint, if not just a little annoyance, is that the subs are for deaf/hard of hearing people; which means that non-dialogue noise is subtitled. When music plays, a subtitle says 'music playing'. It took me a while to get accustomed to, but I did.

As for the movie itself, VERY GOOD. A bit long, I really enjoyed it nevertheless. This is where history books fail miserably. They don't take you right into the action; this movie does. It gave me a front seat row to these amazing historical moments. The guy who plays Hitler is brilliant. I walked away with a different perception of Hitler. As evil as he was, he was still a man, a human being. This movie does a terrific job of showing us Hitler, his humanity, utter insanity, and sheer genius that made him into a fuhrer.

As for the uploader, many thanks!!!"
[T],MrLore,2009-01-17T00:26Z,"The audio is the exact same volume as on the DVD, I suggest you either:

1. Have a hearing test
or 2. Check your system settings"
