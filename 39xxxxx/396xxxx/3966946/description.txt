NON CONVENTIONAL HOMES:


In this 30 minute program, see how some people have created some truly amazing and beautifully stunning homes, using "alternative" (or natural) building materaials.

Not only are these homes low maintenance, they are high in sustainability, but these homes are much more energy efficient, and  their insulation qualities are far superior to the 'conventional' building materials, that are commonly used in most homes.


These natural building materials include:

- Mudbrick and alternative mortars
- Rammed Earth bricks
- Poured Earth bricks and:
- Composting toilets



I think that the comments by one person in this program are so profound, that I have to quote him when he says:


"In a time, with a much stronger individual consciousness; it is even more important that [the individual consciousness], is somehow reflected in the buildings, and the spaces in which we live in. 

It may be through art, or the way we design, or the way we build; but if we just use the materials or whatever is on the shelf,  we kind of limit ourselves to that;  and I think that these homes, they show that you can do so much more.

It's letting our own creativity be a part of this whole process, and that in the end, it becomes a true reflection of ourselves."
