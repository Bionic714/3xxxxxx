,teo42,2008-01-05T07:43Z,Thanx a lot. Keep up the good work. Undubs are realy fun to play.
,Zamzummin,2008-03-10T08:18Z,"DVD Decrypter tells me there isn't enough space to burn this game. It says the dvd only has 2,295,104 sectors and the game is 2,295,740 sectors. What program can I use to burn this game?"
,Valkyriesphere,2008-03-24T00:27Z,"Could I load the game's save file from the original US version on this one? 

Btw thanx a hell lot for yet another UNDUB work! x] "
,Kreuzian,2008-04-03T04:17Z,"Is there someone I can pay to undub a game? I'm decent at japanese listening, but I can't understand the unspoken written kanji. 

It's a game based on a popular anime, so I'm sure others might be interested. Just wonder how to get it done."
,Hikaru_Ichijo,2008-05-21T20:57Z,"Have the same problem as zam, nero says there isn't enough space on the dvd. what program should be used to burn it?"
,Silparion,2008-05-27T18:01Z,"I ensured it worked fine! I had burned it with DVD Decrypter regardless the saying ""not enough space or something"".Writes it with 2x speed, just waiting until its done.
Enjoy and have fun with japanese voices :D

,ramin1254,2008-08-03T02:00Z,"Hi, i downloaded the torrent and when i try to extract it i get this problem saying ""There is not enough space on the disk"" and ""Write error: Only NTFS File system supports files larger than 4GB""
WHAT DO I DOOOO?!?!?!?"
,Silparion,2008-09-11T18:53Z,"^ You have to extract it at Local Disk with ""File
System : NTSF"" , an original local disk is C
(I guess you extracted it at another drive that
has FAT system -_- because it won't allow you
to extract the large amount of file like 4 GB.).
Sorry, if I explained unclear. > < "
,PYTWOTL,2008-12-06T04:45Z,"Yo im trying to dl this but im stuck at 99%, can someone plz seed the last bit, i will seed the whole thing for a long time"

,Silparion,2008-12-24T17:04Z,"It only occurs on some of PS2 console that affected this game to getting stuck when you commence the first battle. Perhaps it was your chip, which allow all private copies be able to play. ""Crystal Chip"" was the one I knew it didn't work with this game as well. Please try on other PS2 to fix this problem :-)"
,Silparion,2008-12-24T17:08Z,"Oh I did a mistake XD
