What if Captain America had lived in the American Civil War?
What if the Fantastic Four were cosmonauts?
What if the Submariner lived with his human father?
What if Daredevil had lived in Feudal Japan?
What if Thor was herald of Galactus?
What if Wolverine became the Punisher in the 1920s? (aka What If... Wolverine was Public Enemy #1?)
