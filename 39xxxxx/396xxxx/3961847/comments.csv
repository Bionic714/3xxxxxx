,overlydiatonic,2008-01-16T23:36Z,"The criticism of OLPC in this is hilariously uninformed; there are legitimate criticisms of the OLPC project, but these people have no idea what they're talking about. It's like they just read the first paragraph of the OLPC article on Wikipedia, and now think they know it all. Unless it's intended as satire?

I laughed out loud when they criticized OLPC's use of Linux, suggesting that Windows or Mac would be more user friendly. That was so dumb I hardly know where to begin. First off, using Windows or Mac would have meant huge per-unit license fees, and these armchair critics just got done pointing out that the OLPC is very expensive by the standards of the people it's meant to benefit; second, Windows and Mac are not open source, meaning it would have been impossible to do the project; third, there's no way any version of Windows or Mac released in the past ten years would run on a machine with OLPC's specs, whereas a stripped-down Linux can, and finally, because NO OS has a really child-friendly interface, OLPC uses a custom-designed, simple GUI. http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sugar

Then our hosts point out that third-world countries lack reliable electrical power. Gee, nobody thought of that. http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Battery_and_power#Ideas_for_Alternate_Power_Sources They point out the lack of internet access. This is why the OLPC has wireless mesh networking support. http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Networking I have my own skepticisms about OLPC, but why dismiss something you know NOTHING about? You just make fools of yourselves. Five minutes of research would have cleared up every question raised on this podcast.

What is the point? I'm asking myself, why am I listening to this crap?

(Well, I'm listening to this crap because TorrentFreak told me there's a Brokep interview later on. Hopefully that'll be done with a bit more competence than the OLPC report.)"
,project6,2008-01-17T00:18Z,"Agreed, they obviously don't know enough about OLPC to comment it. Nice with the interview though."
,Puumala,2008-01-17T23:03Z,I didn't really like that WIndows & MAC part but nice interview :) Hope we get one with video ;)
