,Giddyotwiggy,2011-04-05T14:18Z,No sound...? Anyone else have that problem? Maybe a codec i need to install?
,Giddyotwiggy,2011-04-05T14:27Z,"Oh btw thanks to _Maelstrom_ and everyone seeding, great video quality and great speed!"
,Giddyotwiggy,2011-04-05T14:37Z,"Sorry no worries I worked out the problem; to anyone planning on joining the two files using VirtualDub (as I did) you might need the lastest DivX Codec Pack. I got this and joining the files then worked, but it also apparently killed the sound on all my .avi files in Win Media Player. So I uninstalled the new DivX, and everything worked fine. Just advice for anyone who wants to do this."
