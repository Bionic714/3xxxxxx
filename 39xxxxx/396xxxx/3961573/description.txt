    While Disc 1 and 2, respectively, are brilliant collections of rare tracks and remixes, the real gem is the live disc. It is not the "best of" set that the crowd obviously expected - some fans are yearning for "Yashar! Yashar!" after every song but the Cabs didn't include it in their set. Instead the main focus is put on stuff from the "Groovy Laidback and Nasty" era and thereafter. Beside vivid reworks from album tracks, enriched by very cool voice samples, you can hear rarities such as the outstanding "Positive ID" (originally on the B-Side of the "Easy Life" 12"), the powerful analogue-sounding "Whole World" and a really cool Acid House Track called "Ride Baby Ride". The concert sounds as if it was an open air performance, and it is in fact so 'live' that everytime I hear it feels like being there.
