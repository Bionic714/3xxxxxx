,Damien74,2010-12-18T14:21Z,"If this is update for existing update rv2 perhaps you should have named it rv3 or rv2.1 or something.
This is the original update you need before this one folks: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3823454/GTA_San_Andreas_Real_v2_[ovisebdan]"
,Damien74,2010-12-18T23:41Z,What in the name of the whatever is this? This is not a patch. Its a MOD! And it looks like more like the first GTA ever than a 3D game LOL!!! And naked women on the streets? Really? You're a regular comedian ^^
,ovisebdan,2011-04-18T01:00Z,"@Damien74

It's a patch, not a mod. It's a patch FOR a mod. It is for Real v2, as in first you download the mod (Rv2) and then you apply this patch over it. This fixes several bugs the mod has.

Judging by your last comment and what I just said, I think we have successfully established that you are a moron."

P.S. I made this almost 4 years ago, when I was 15. At the time it seemed silly and funny to make those women naked.

Dumb-ass."
