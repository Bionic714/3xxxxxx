,trancemix07,2008-05-20T03:03Z,"it looks great but without descriptions, its all a waste of time. Maybe if there was a way to know what you were looking at, it would have been worth the time it took to download. Also, you would think there would be a lot of pictures in here but there is only about 350-400 and about 200 are really bad quality."
