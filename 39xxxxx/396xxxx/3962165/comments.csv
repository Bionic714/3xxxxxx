,horsepro,2009-02-08T03:11Z,"This was the only game I ever played that I got motion sickness from. Great game and much appreciated download. Works great on my XP-Pro machine, I?m also wondering what I did with that joystick. I was just telling a youngster about this game the other day and he said ?no-way 6 degrees of movement? I said yes indeed and if someone with today?s rendering capabilities would take this concept and work with it. It could be astounding and I bet a best seller."
,horsepro,2009-03-07T18:31Z,Great up! I have been playing this version for about a month and it works perfectly. I wish the game makers would make more like this now.
,zmbipancake,2009-06-08T23:38Z,is the descent 2 game in this torrent 64 bit compatible? i have the 3 disk descent 1 and 2 definitive collection but descent 2 on it isnt 64 bit compatible
,Raapzaad,2012-01-04T00:03Z,"It is 64 bit compatible. I'm playing it on Windows 7 64 Bit

Install it, then 
Just rightclick on Descent Ultimate icon; and then properties and select compatibility mode and then Windows XP service pack 3 and it works like a charm."
