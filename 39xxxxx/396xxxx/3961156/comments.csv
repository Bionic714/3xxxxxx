,flippydippy,2008-01-28T20:41Z,"hi there guys,

I am new to this emulating/mounting images/burning software to CD's business and was wondering if you could give me a starting hand...

Do you need to write the files to CD before being able to use them?
If so, what file type should I burn them as (I have Alcohol 120 as suggested above)

OR can I mount the images somehow (have tried Daemon tools, but all it says is insert CD!)?

Many thanks for any advice!"
,ajaccio,2008-02-03T18:55Z,"flippydippy

You can  burn Images as an ISO file, if you wish, but try this this:

Install Daemon Tools, Run it :) then mount image and have fun, thats it :)

But they didn't ask for it while installing, only when I try to run them.
