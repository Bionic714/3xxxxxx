,TheRekcah,2010-12-15T02:14Z,"For those wondering, this torrent has the following:
A Text file ""Ad"" for Royaltyfreestockfootage
A video clip of an eye blinking
A video clip that I can't even tell what it is.
A video clip of clouds flying overhead.

That's all. Only useful thing is the clouds. Not really worth the download..."
