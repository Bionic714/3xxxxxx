Black Diamond: The Anthology is a compilation album by the Finnish power metal band Stratovarius. It is an anthology of songs ranging from their debut album Fright Night to their latest self-titled album Stratovarius.

In November 2006 the band announced that the project had been shelved for an "undetermined time." This was attributed to them not feeling right about releasing another compilation album at this point in their career. However, it may be released at a later date, or amended and then released after the release of their new album.

SEED please! Cheers!
