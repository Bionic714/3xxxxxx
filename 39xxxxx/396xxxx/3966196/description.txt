This is a small collection of quotes from the motoring show Top Gear, coded in mp3 format.
It includes Jeremy Clarkson saying 'How hard can it be?' and James May saying 'Hello' to a small boat he collides with, saying 'I love you' to a french woman, saying 'Oh, cock!' and asking about its Norwegian translation, stating his view on procedures and accusing his co-presenters of being both utter pirates and a pair of useless scurvy dogs.
Enjoy.
