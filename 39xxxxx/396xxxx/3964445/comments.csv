Thanks Oxygeen!

If someone has trouble with this try these:

1) Don't know where to click after opening the .zip file?
Answer: Click the icon that says ""WA.exe""

2)Get's a black screen after finishing a game?
Answer: Search at the bottom-right of the screen for the back button(you cant see it) and press it."
