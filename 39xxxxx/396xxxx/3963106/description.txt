Like the previous two games, the objective of RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is to complete a series of preset scenarios by successfully building, owning, and maintaining amusement parks. Players can choose from over 50 unique types of roller coasters like wooden, steel, looping and inverted coaster and can also build merry-go-rounds, chairswings, enterprises, Skywheels, bumper cars, swinging inverter ships, gravitrons, log flumes, and ferris wheels, among other rides. Players can also build their own roller coasters, laying out individual track pieces, choosing direction, height, and steepness, and adding elements such as corkscrews, loops, twists, helixes, S bends, and even on-ride photos. Furthermore, the player can modify the foliage, landscaping and themeing of the park. Players must also balance the needs of the park's visitors by placing concession stands and facilities. The player also must manage the park's budget in the costs of their staff, ride construction and operations, and the income from rides, concessions, and the park entry fee.

Returning to the third game in the series is the "career" mode. Each scenario has 3 sets of goals: Apprentice, Entrepreneur, and Tycoon. In this game, as requested by fans for years, a Sandbox Mode has been added. It allows players to create their own amusement park without any money restrictions or objectives. Players can also design custom scenarios and coasters, as in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2
