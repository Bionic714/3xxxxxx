Setup winrar sfx recompiled and toolbars ripped from setup.cfg/Setupx.exe script and all appended useless toolbar files.

Updated:
LightScribe API Version 1.10.27.1 [December 2007] added
Keys embedded in setup for all Plug-Ins
Nero CD-DVD Speed 4.7.7.15 [Jan. 2008] updated
Nero Info Tool 5.2.3.0 [December 2007] updated

Batch install process:
1. import all Nero Keys include Plugins (no registration required)
2. call nero setup without toolbars (ripped from installer0
3. installs Light scribe support (optional can be skipped)

Installs automatically Nero 6 Ultra Edition + all 11 Plugins fully registered

A complete CD/DVD burning suite installed > 76,8 MB (optimized, nothing ripped)
Setup installer size: 40 MB with embedded LightScribe setup

Version 6.6 does not support securedisk & blue ray, if your drive support it, you may need Nero 7 (installed about 450 MB). Product freaks may use Nero 8 in full installation 700mb - 1gig.

rem: with a enabled 'editing of locked archives edition from winrar' you can edit the batch process in 'winrar comment' for example:
setup start:
w/o registering (later manual registration required & w/o light scribe setup
change:
Setup=run.bat
to:
Setup=setupx.exe /SFX 

Nero's unattended switches can be used besides Pre registration Key solution to embedded it in windows setup cd's.
