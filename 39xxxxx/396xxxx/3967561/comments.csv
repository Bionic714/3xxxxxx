,friktioner,2008-02-01T16:44Z,is this really low quality? whats the kbps? 128kbps?
,synthacon,2008-02-05T21:10Z,"The quality is 192 throughout, but the new songs have a bit of a gritty edge like they were recorded off an internet stream perhaps.
The album itself sounds a bit strange, could just be I'm used to the old mixes.  I think I prefer my old LP.
Cheers"
,Lurekuk,2008-02-09T20:05Z,strange bad quality
