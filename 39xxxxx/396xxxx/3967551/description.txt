                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"When you look at me, what do you see?" pontificates football star Joe Kingman, 
then provides the answer: "Greatness." Well, clearly an ego like that needs to 
be brought down to size--pint-size. The winning family comedy The Game Plan has 
a whole lot going for it, including star Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who's a 
natural comedic actor (and the camera loves him), and the young actress (Madison 
Pettis) who plays the daughter he didn't know he had, Peyton. The plot doesn't 
break much new ground, since many films have mined the territory of the 
self-indulgent child-adult who suddenly "inherits" a child (from Three Men and a 
Baby to Baby Boom to Big Daddy to Raising Helen). But thanks to the charismatic 
performance of Johnson, the film is winsome and uplifting. Johnson's comic 
timing and straight-man face are spot-on, as is his warm chemistry with the 
sweet-faced Pettis. Also giving notable performances are the lovely Roselyn 
Sanchez as Peyton's ballet teacher, and Kyra Sedgwick as Kingman's hard-nosed 
agent who's aghast at the appearance of an out-of-wedlock child. Children and 
adults both can enjoy the movie's warm-and-fuzzy moral of making family where 
you find it--or where it finds you.
