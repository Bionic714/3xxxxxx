,george234,2008-02-25T04:19Z,"as soon as i started this d/l i got this......This AVI file was not prepared for sequential readin. the alternative 'Avi Splitter' will now let the defult one handle it. The complete reinterleaving of this file is strongly recomended before burning it onto a slow media like cd-rom

wtf"

,JayBizzle,2008-03-23T14:29Z,Hey can someone explain why i have no sound on this Torrent?
,nDiScReEt,2008-05-06T06:05Z,"JayBizzle: That would depend on what you are using to view and listen to this avi file and on what system. Like myself for instance, I am on a Power Mac G5 running Leopard. I find that in some programs like Quicktime I can not hear or see when I run the file but if I use another program like VLC my problem is solved. To get the same file to run in quicktime, I would have to download a third-party plugin like divx and niceplayer. HTH"
