,arjuna725,2008-01-15T04:43Z,Haven't gotten to work.  This torrent uses .html files to access the internet.  Every time I try to open a different lesson link firefox quits.  Any way around this?

,pxl,2008-01-21T08:10Z,Movies are in Quicktime. Dunno how you Wintendo users do to play them (I'm on a mac) but I guess you have to download Quicktime from apple.com. Hopefully that solves your problems.
