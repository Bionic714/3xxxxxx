,FlightSimerr,2008-01-09T04:48Z,"I have gotten the plane to load and initiate and no reported problems but I cannot get the ECAM or any other of the digital gauges to display. if i run my mouse over them it shows the information as a tool-tip but I have black windows on my panel. anyone have any ideas? I'm running FSX over vista home premium and did the install exactly as instructed in the included HTM file. 

Any help would be great. I""m not a leacher I up FSX files all the time and will fill a request to someone who can help if i have what they're looking for.. 


thank you! "

,dndv2,2008-07-03T22:46Z,"Installation on FSX if you have it or doesnt have it FS9

1. Create a folder named ""FLight Simulator 9"" without the "" "" and a file inside the folder named FS9.exe

   Its easier if you create the folder on C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9

2. Mount image Fliight_One_ATR_72_500.iso with Daemon Tool 
    On Install request Choose the path were you created "" Flight Simulator 9 "" folder and Install, Finish Installation if prompt to reboot is not necessary

3. Install ATR_SP2-1_Setup.exe  , will also ask for Flight Simulator 9 folder, just locate were you created and install

4. Install ATR_SP3.exe , will also ask for Flight Simulator 9 folder, just locate were you created and install

5. This Download comes with a FSX folder , inside this folder there is a file named ATR-FSX.zip , extract the file inside that should be ATR-FSX.exe

6. Install ATR-FSX.exe , will ask to LOCATE for Flight Simulator 9 folder, just locate were you created and install (This will copy the necessary files from Flight Simulator 9 folder to your already installed Flight Simulator X folder

7. Install ATR-FSX-SP1.exe, this will UPDATE ATR-72  to latest release, Choose your Flight Simulator X folder

 DONE"
