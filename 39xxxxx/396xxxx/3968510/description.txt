_____________________________________________________________Summary__

This documentary reveals the top-secret cooperation between the CIA
and the PLO since the early 1970s. It looks at why the US felt the
need to protect American interests in the Middle East by reaching an
agreement with 'terror organisation'. With Islamic extremism on the
rise in Gaza and the West Bank, the US gave Jibril Rajoub, head of
the Preventive Security Service in the West Bank millions of dollars
and members of his force were extensively trained by the CIA in the
aim of destroying Hamas. The program uncovers how, in 1998, at least
40 Palestinians were taken to the CIA complexes in Virginia for a
top secret training course.
