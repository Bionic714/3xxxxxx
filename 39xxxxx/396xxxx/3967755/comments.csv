,smexydude,2008-01-14T22:08Z,i used daemon tools it works aswell
,Miscreant_Stapler,2008-01-14T23:37Z,"Guys... .nrg is supported by Daemon tools, as it is the format created when ripping a disk with Nero.

Only reason I even have PowerISO is for .daa files."

,carts2,2008-02-01T22:06Z,i have tried to use these crack files on many different games can someone e-mail me at mark1carts@hotmail.com and tell me exactly how to do this i ahave installed the file and monted it but get the message insert the disk i know i have to copy the crack to a file but which one please help ....thanks
,mayfield4,2008-02-04T11:03Z,"carts2 - you have to copy the crack to the ROOT DIRECTORY of the game files. In other words, your C drive in most cases. You should have a folder called EA, which is where the files for NFS are kept. Copy the crack into there. Sometimes the new cracked nfs.exe file doesnt replace the old, it appears as a shortcut instead, which means the game wont run.

To get round this, you can simply move all the game files in the  EA folder to the same folder as the crack - except for the original nfs.exe file. you dont need to move this as you now have a new cracked nfs.exe file. 

this should make the game work fine - just double click on the new nfs.exe crack file and off you go."
