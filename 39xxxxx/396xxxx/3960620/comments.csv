,ProudAnselmo,2008-01-23T17:28Z,"File was broken, but I was able to fix it with vlc mp.  

Sound was still very fuzzy though.  Fans might want to wait for a the HBO On Demand version.  

I shut it off after a few minutes.  This show is too good to watch with crap audio!"
,theveil,2008-01-24T14:59Z,"audio is a bit muffled, video is decent"
,Laminat,2008-01-30T21:14Z,Thanks for the upload. The video is all right but the sound is really crappy.
