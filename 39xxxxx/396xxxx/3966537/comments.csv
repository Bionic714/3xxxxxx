not everybody has the money to upgrade their old-school G3 downstairs to mac OS 19.9.9

Just because apple comes out with an update does not mean the previous systems are now outdated.
I can still get new  software for Mac OS 9 and 10.4x but not anywhere in between.
you assholes love giving apple $150 bucks every
system dont you. i develop my own programs!
fucktards!"
