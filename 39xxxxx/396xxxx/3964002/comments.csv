,AeMomo,2008-08-20T06:30Z,"I'm sorry, but when i mount it using Daemon, the quickstart shows Uninstall and Play, but i haven't installed it yet. Is there anyway to solve this problem? I have alchohol 120% as well, but i don't know how to use it, so if i have to use it, can you show a step-by-step guide? Thanks in advance.

P.S: Seeding this."
,GrimGlory13,2008-08-21T07:11Z,Why would you need to mount this game anyways? Once your done installing it it doesn't require the cd. I'm confused...
,xlucidx,2008-08-29T18:57Z,The game crashes on start up.
,Sathrax,2008-10-17T12:26Z,"Cinematics dont work, when you try to run the game with the img or ccd mounted it crashes because of the title cinematic. and when you try to run the game THEN mount the files, and then tyr to run a cinematic it crashes as well."
,Murreh,2009-02-18T15:27Z,"Might be late help for you guys, but unmount the .img file and then start the game from a shortcut and it should work."
,Nutgoblin,2009-04-12T21:45Z,u know any similar games?
,darlakk,2009-08-07T00:03Z,"Majesty ROX, 2 is on the way soon...."
,Tripgnosis,2009-08-16T23:40Z,"lol I had to set the scrolling speed to '4'

btw, Thanx a bunch for that info hald0, I never would have thought to look in the registry and the game would not have been playable. 

everyone else, if you use the regedit to change teh scrollspeed make sure not to alter it in the options. turning the fast scroll on sets it to 64, and turning it off sets it to 20. "
,TheMaciej,2009-08-17T16:44Z,"If you have too powerfull pc it may cause crashes at beggining. To fix it: 

Start > Run 
enter ""dxdiag"" 
go to ""display"" page (in my winXp_PL its called ""Ekran"", i hope i translated it correctly)

disable DirectDraw

Try running game now."
,xyden,2009-08-20T09:26Z,So i did both of the solutions on here for the game crashing and neither worked.  My game is still crashing.  Help please!
,501.st,2009-09-06T17:43Z,"Got it workin' thanks to Hald0. Game crashes in-game, tho."
,Gornax,2009-09-16T07:37Z,Bah majesty is releasing 18th sept...so far awaaaaay
,c0mmun15tm4n,2009-10-04T09:00Z,"sequel is NOTHING compared to this one, just because it has NO SKIRMISH/FREEPLAY MODE."
,zarreph,2010-06-06T05:08Z,"Great torrent, adding the manual was a great help. I borrowed this from a friend ages ago, sans manual, and there's a lot of stuff in there that really would have been good to know (e.g. gravestones not disappearing until you make a hero to replace the dead one).

Did everything Hald0 suggested, and the game runs fine. It does, however, still crash when it tries to do the intro cinematics for any quest. Skirmish mode is fine, and that's all I really wanted, but if anybody knows of a fix for this it would be appreciated. The ""play the tutorial level"" prompt every time will get old."
,fight4anarchy,2011-05-01T10:18Z,good torrent SUUUPPPEEERRR FAST download :) nice work
,songking,2011-05-02T22:52Z,"Can someone post the instructions. I dont understand how to use a .cod , .img , and .sub"
,McGuffey,2011-05-20T01:42Z,Thanks Nillaj. I owe you one ^-^
,McGuffey,2011-05-20T01:44Z,"@ Songking
download either Daemon tools or Alcohol 120% and then Mount the .ccd
It will play as if you've put the actual CD into your drive. Then you'll be able to install and play the game."
,Ririchan,2011-07-15T19:50Z,"After installing, MSE detected a virus in a .dll. False positives on .dll files are common, though."
,AKABUR,2012-01-23T12:40Z,"Works like a charm. Windows7 Premium. All I did is install the game and run it as administrator in a compatibility mode. Here are my compatibility options I used:
1. Win98
2.Run in 256 colors"
,RogherNahasa,2012-02-08T18:49Z,Thanks.
,Ancasta666,2012-06-01T14:48Z,"Is there just a crack for this game anywhere? I love downloading the tools and then just working it all out myself, so anyone?"
