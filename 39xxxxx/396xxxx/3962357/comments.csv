,minimum26,2008-02-02T20:18Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!!
AVG free edition found 3 files, infected with different trojans.
Big f*** you, iuli_kyle !"
,iuli_kyle,2008-02-04T21:05Z,"Most probably the ""malware"" are from cracks, keygens and so on. And AVG is crap, most surely the ""viruses"" are false positives. "
,laban333,2008-03-15T04:00Z,Looks very interesting. How can I get an invite to your forum at www.project-os.org?
,Artymonn,2008-03-27T10:20Z,Hey all you Newbie idiots running around yelling wolf (Virus) about these great people sharing their hard work with us......Get the fuck out of here and go suck on mommy's tit. Then go buy the program and quit your whining. Then you won't have to worry about all the reverse engineering and hacker tools that were used to get these programs ready for us to use. Virus programs are meant to be triggered by these tools of the trade.
,belzeburg,2008-07-18T20:16Z,"I do hope in all your work you have made an OS that have all the basic program working. Because i have tried several Windows that looked great after install, but with some basic program missing or not working. Hoping yours is perfect, which i am looking for, when installing in the future"
,scottcam,2008-07-24T21:13Z,"I have used a whole lot of different versions of this program and this one is by far the best I have ever used. It loads EVERYTHING , you dont need any other disk besides this one. The computer that I am on right now has been loaded for about 8 months and this OS is AMAZING!! to say the least. I will run this until ALL the bugs are worked out of Vista and maybe longer.
Congradulations to iuli_Kyle for a fantastic OS.
By far the best torrent that I have ever downloaded.

Thanx

,ScrubbyScott,2010-03-07T09:20Z,Does this include Xp Media Center 2005? I know it says Media Center then it says Nero..
