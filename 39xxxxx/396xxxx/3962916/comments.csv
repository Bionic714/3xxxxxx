Ran the scan just before I posted the comment.  I have this program installed on 3 computers, including the laptop I'm working on as I type this.  I haven't had any problems on any of the machines, and I have a virus scan run every week on my server to see if something slipped in, and if something were to be infected, I would delete it asap."
