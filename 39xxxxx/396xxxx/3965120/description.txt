this is a hard one to find!  I looked for this one for this one forever.  Lots of good information with an "anti theory" based approach (doesn't get into ohms law or equations).  Very down to earth.  I've heard complaints about how this guy has diagrams laid out for several instruments that can be bent and that circuit bending should be something you explore on your own, but if you only have one speak and spell and you don't want to take risks with it, this is a good place to start.  Good generic ways to modify toys and other gear in the appendix.  Please seed! If you enjoy this book, please buy it.  The author has been doing this stuff since the 60's and he deserves our support!
