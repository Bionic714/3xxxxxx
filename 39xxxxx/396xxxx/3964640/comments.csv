,sparky1sparky,2008-10-09T14:20Z,"tmsboys, you're terrific. Thanks so much for taking the time to put the 3 volumes together.

THANK YOU Seeders!! 

After 3 weeks of trying, I finally got all 3 of your Volumes. Happy as a clam!

They're all clean and perform perfectly.

I'll seed for at least another week for others in the same boat.
