SYNOPSIS:	         \"\'Sink the knives into Jewish flesh and bone.\'  My flesh!\"
Based upon the book by Solomon Perel recalling his adventures in World War II as a German Jewish teenager.  Separated from his family early in the war, Solomon, through a series of improbable circumstances, and aided by his good looks and knowledge of languages, becomes first a Komsomol (Young Communist), then a German war hero, and then a honored member of the Hitler Youth.  A nearly unbelievable tale of survival.
