Are you really that fucking retarded? In future save yourself the embarressment and don't claim something of being malicious unless you truly know that it is. AV's are capable of being too sensitive and picking something up as malicious, Which to a degree hydra is bad, But only because its a bruteforce application.
Hydra is used to crack logins from a TS2 server, It attempts a password list with the given username.

So to the public, This is safe.
If ever in doubt, Get 'deep freeze' and then open the application in doubt.
If your still afraid to attempt that, Then don't fucking download warez and buy the fucking thing.

Good day!"
