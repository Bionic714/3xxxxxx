,SuperStar3000,2011-12-28T21:56Z,"This is a great film that will appeal to fans of the 'psychological thriller' genre.  A superior-quality thriller that somehow got lost in the flood of 'direct-to-DVD' gems of the late 1990s.  

An all-star cast and superior production values make this film Definitely worth watching. 

Excellent Quality download - (there are Spanish subtitles, but they are unobtrusive).
The sound and video quality is clean."
,croakerbc,2012-08-19T23:00Z,I agree. This is a great thriller that is sadly unknown and underrated.
