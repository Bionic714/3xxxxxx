Plotline:

It's great to see a film that moves along so freely
and easily but also has a clever writer behind it.
Someone mentioned that the film was being touted as
Trainspotting shot in Canada with laughs. Trainspotting
didn't cross my mind once during this film. I liked Trainspotting
when it came out, but if there was one criticism you could make
it was that the film took itself a little too seriously.
Thankfully this film doesn't and is all the better for it.
Everything about it feels fresh and you really get the feeling
that everyone involved enjoyed making it. The acting has a nice
improvised quality and script is a perfect mix of playful whimsy
and taut storyline.
If you got out the wrong side of the bed, don't go and see this.
If you're looking for an enjoyable and refreshing 90 minutes that
restores your faith in low budget films, buy a ticket.
