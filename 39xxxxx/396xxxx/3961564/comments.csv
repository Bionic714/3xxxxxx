--------------------------

Only one 'D' is missing from the game title. Relax, we'll all be fine. Except you, who can't spell 'suspicious' and can't put a capitol E at the start of 'English'. Perhaps you should learn to use the language we've all agreed upon before you become irate at others for smaller mistakes than your own.

As for telling people to 'speak English', on a site based in Sweden; I'll go ahead and assume that you know how stupid that sounds. People can speak whatever language they fucking well like.

More helpfully, this release works perfectly. This IS the same game as the original 'Worms Armageddon', but with new maps, weapons and a handful of other features."
,Easle-5,2008-03-12T17:41Z,"Uh.. yes, you put a capital letter at the start, if you are a typing a country name. But he/she was typing.. well.. the name of the language, not the country. You ""fuckbag"" lol

1. Mount the .IMG to Daemon

Why thank you kind sir. Actually come to find out, I was doing it right! But my IMG path was corrupted.

Thank you though!""

What do you mean ""come to find out""? You mean, you did what we told you to and did some research?

Listen dude, we aren't assholes, we are just sick of seeing people not put in the same amount of effort we have in order to figure things out on our own, which trust me, wasn't much effort at all. I see no reason why anyone shouldn't be able to figure this kind of stuff out. There's an endless amount of resources all over the internet, forums with search buttons, tutorials ect. ect..

Since you obviously don't know how to locate these, I will teach you..

Whenever I can't figure something out, I simply search Google with the name of the app and ""how to"" in quotes. For instance, Daemon tools. Dunno how to use it? Type in ""daemon tools mounting, ""how to"""". Low and behold, look what we get....

http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&q=daemon+tools+mounting+%22how+to%22&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&oq=daemon+tools+mounting+%22how+to%22&fp=OlAWEoQSgPM

Everything you could ever want on using Daemon tools, or close to it at least. Way more than enough to get you going and learning the basics in any case. And once you know the basics, from there, you can do anything.

Or, for instance, maybe you are getting slow speeds, you aren't sure if you set up your client right, so you go to google, and what you wanna type is something like ""optimize torrent client"" or ""speed up bit torrent""

Respectively:

http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&ei=WZX8SYqtFeSwtgen86mSDA&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=optimize+torrent+client&spell=1&fp=OlAWEoQSgPM

http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&q=speed+up+bit+torrent&fp=uD046Tc5Yaw

See? It's not hard to just search for what you need to find. You can learn how to do ANYTHING using the internet. You could learn how to put together a god damn jet engine using google. Literally.

So when we go off on people, it's because they simply don't go into google and do a proper search on what they need to know. If you've searched google, and you've exhausted all other options, then I can understand asking us for help, but you didn't do that. To me, that is kind of disrespectful. I mean, instead of you, using up your own time to figure out what you want to do, you want someone else to use up their time and type you out specific instructions.

So when it comes down to it, we are just fed up with seeing the same posts over and over and over again. It gets old, and all I can ever think of in my head is ""why the FUCK is this person not using google to find out the answer to their question?"

,Zanmato,2009-08-19T14:16Z,weird with the links ._.
,dolce.god,2009-09-14T03:03Z,I use vista and got the game installed but had the errorlog.txt so I got the upgrade patch but now it keeps asking for the CD before I can play it.  If anyone finds the no-cd crack please post a link - thanks
,desmodronic,2009-09-14T16:23Z,Works perfect for me. Its 3.6.28.0 ver and everything is unlocked. Online works also. Just need a deamon tools. Thanks for this old school 2D game.
,bwmcmaste,2009-11-17T09:53Z,"Tried two re-installs of this on Vista (x86), and it wouldn't work for me (compatibility and admin). I guess someone could try the solutions listed by others here, but I just don't feel like it. Thanks for the super fast download, and here is the dumplog:

,TauTau154,2009-12-10T04:40Z,"Downloaded it, works great, NO VIRUSES TO YOU DOUCHECAKES THAT SAY THERE IS ONE.  Quick question though:  I can't save my game customizations.  Like changing my weapon spawning and such, it won't give me the option to save.  Help?"
,TauTau154,2009-12-10T19:25Z,"Ok now I have another problem.  Updated to 3.6.29 or whatever the newest one is, and got new crack since ""no cd"" came up with other one included in this, now I can't select the music to play in create a team OR save weapon sets... ?_?"
,midnit19,2009-12-22T04:52Z,this work online ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????////
,fibbz,2010-04-30T11:43Z,"Tautau, where did you get your no-cd crack? I've tried a few of them without success.
Done a lot of research on this, but not sure I know enough to get it working... Mounted the ccd, installed the game, updated to 3.6.29.0, then tried to get a no-cd crack, but that's where I'm going wrong right now. Tried a few other torrents too!"
,McKosto,2010-05-11T22:01Z,"Can't get it to play. Without a patch I get an error when running it, and when i patch it, I get the no cd problem. Even after cracking it with some cracks it either makes no difference, or it executes the game, but then crashes..... For anyone who still needs cracks, no cd fixes etc, this is where I found everything, i hope it helps you more than it did me :  http://m0004.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_worms_armageddon.shtml"
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-07-29T11:43Z,Ik works but you CAN'T SAVE
,xiIix,2010-07-30T15:24Z,"People like ryansta need to take their computer and throw it out the fucking window. You computer illiterate fuckheads don't know shit. Guy actually thinks that he got malware after downloading 30% of this torrent. That's the most retarded shit I've heard in a while now. 

NEWS FLASH: YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT COMPUTERS!"
,29732,2010-08-03T03:29Z,"lol 
i wonder is it works on wine on ubuntu..

,rhobhert,2010-08-24T07:13Z,it can use the power iso in this file???????
,szewc,2010-10-08T19:20Z,"Works well, thanks!"
,ozols88,2011-01-06T14:43Z,great game
,neild79,2011-04-03T21:29Z,"Hmmm, ok well since April 1st the game cannot be played online via wormnet unless its updated :/
I tried an update that i downloaded but it just crashes the game to desktop & needs to be re-installed.

Anyone know how to bypass this so that i can play online via wormnet ?"
,carbon666,2012-01-18T18:38Z,If you patch an US versions of Worms Armageddon (which are allready patched) it will cause a 'No CD' error.
