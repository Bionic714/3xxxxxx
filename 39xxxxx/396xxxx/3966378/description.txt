The New Hampshire presidential primary debate that took place on January 5, 2008.

Includes 90 minutes of Republican candidate debate and 90 minutes of Democrat debate.

Grabbed from YouTube in 20 separate pieces and converted to MPGs.  Still in 20 separate pieces (hopefully you can deal with these, and watch the whole thing together, using a playlist).  Sorry about this... I tried to join the files together using FFMPEG, but I found that toward the end of the 3-hour file, the audio got way out of sync.  Better to have 20 separate files with proper sync, I think.

The New Hampshire primary is tomorrow!  Crazy times...  :)
