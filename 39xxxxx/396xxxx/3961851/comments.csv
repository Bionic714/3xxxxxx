,Nop666,2008-01-05T08:01Z,"Well, I for one appreciate you putting it up!
I'll comment on the quality after I D/L it. ;^)"
,Awesum_1,2008-01-06T07:00Z,Whats the difference between the original directors cut and this one  
,Awesum_1,2008-01-06T07:01Z,"never mind ...I did not see this at first..For differences between the director's cut and the Final Cut, see wikipedia:

,Art_Vendelay,2008-01-07T08:39Z,"thx for the upload...been looking for 700mb version for a while

perfect dvd quality & sound
great upload"
,AboXXL,2008-01-07T10:20Z,Nice one ... would appreciate Dutch subs.
,jydetamp,2008-01-12T04:30Z,"A monumental classic. One of the first I ever saw in a cinema. My favorite for all time. Rudtger Hauer at his very very best, the frail beauty of Sean Young immortalized and the brilliant score by Vangelis. Thy very much WeeKnighT"
,starfoxteam,2008-01-23T02:23Z,"Please Seed.

The Difference between The Final & Original is that the Final Cut is remastered in 5.1 Audio and the picture quality is retouched to make it look look better.  The original has MPEG1 quality, or a little higher, which is VHS.  This one looks and sounds better.  "
,Fesi104,2008-01-25T16:21Z,Please seed. I am allmost there.
,Chauffuer,2008-05-14T19:28Z,are these hardcoded subs or not?
,HawkPunk,2008-07-19T02:22Z,"This is a stunning upload.  Thank you forever.  Watching the film, in this quality, is a true wonder, like seeing a masterpiece painting, not a copy.
(an aside) Roy's answer to Tyrell's question:  What do you want....
""I want more Life, Fucker!""  (one of the classic lines in cinema)  was changed by Scott to the rather timid: ""I want more life, father.""
Perhaps more poignant, but far less powerful.

,finny6,2008-07-27T08:05Z,"starfoxteam, you didn't read the wiki did you?  The differences are a whole lot more than audio and picture quality."
,capt.night,2008-08-16T17:17Z,"I simply... Love you. I cant describe in words how much I appreciate subs in a file. Since it so many times takes more than 30min to film to be ready to watch! 

THANK YOU :) Keep up the good work!"
,bean_cs,2009-02-01T23:05Z,Thanks a bunch! This was my favourite cut of the film.
,skybot,2009-05-09T22:59Z,yay thanks! :HUG:
,ssintercept,2009-06-19T05:54Z,hey weeknight- i really dig the 1 cd size complete with\subs. class! nothing but class...thank you sir. +1
,TrashCompaqtor,2009-07-30T06:34Z,"Thanks....

But, the Final Cut is supposed to be 117 minutes long.

The one being shared is just under 113 minutes.

I smell a NUKE"
[V],WeeKnighT,2009-08-19T01:43Z,"TrashCompaqtor , PAL compression causes that.

,Bigjamesputnam,2009-09-09T18:34Z,I thought the titles in the beginning were a little blocky and pixelated but the film quality for the most part was pretty good.  Unbelievable movie and a good download.
,dedutch,2009-11-26T09:51Z,"@ WeeKnighT

Thank you so much for uploading this! I'm a big Battlestar fan and heard Eddie Olmos talk about this film, was instantly interested. Downloaded this torrent and absolutely loved it!

Quality is very good alround, both audio and visual. The film itself, as I said, is amazing and it even has a Dutchman in it!

Thanks WeeKnighT!!!!"
,dedutch,2009-11-26T09:52Z,oh and +1 off course :-)
,tehbritta,2010-08-01T06:34Z,"while this is a great quality torrent, it is not the correct cut. this is actually the work print cut, not the final cut, which was disappointing since this was the most promising torrent out there :\"
,tehbritta,2010-08-01T08:34Z,"i withdraw the previous statement, it is the proper cut.. it just didn't sync correctly with the dvd for some odd reason."
,lilkiss,2010-09-22T06:29Z,thanks cuz
,RazorPapa,2010-10-24T15:16Z,Thank you WeeKnighT for this wonderful torrent download of WunSeeDee. Just finished watching it. Video and audio quality is great! More power to you. :)
