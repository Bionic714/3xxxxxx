I have always been impressed by LBT?s harmonies and ?A Place to Land? is the tightest they have sounded yet. I loved ?I?m With the Band? from the first time I heard them do it in concert and know how much they appreciate their fans. The title track, with it?s down-home banjo intro and Kimberly?s sugary sweet voice, is really cute and makes me smile. ?Novocaine?, ?Vapor? and ?Fine Line? are all clever plays on words and I laughed the first time I heard ?Firebird Fly?, not just because of the lyrics but because Phillip sounds kind of like Phil Vassar at the beginning. ?Fury? is the most rockin? and closes the album with a bang. Jimi sounds awesome on ?To Know Love? and reflects his true happiness now. I couldn?t be happier for the triumphs of this band and think this collection will go platinum quick!!
