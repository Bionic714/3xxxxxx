,notyourbroom,2008-01-12T00:24Z,"Maybe this is just me, but the file seems to be damaged. It skips like crazy and is unwatchable. I don't know enough about this to know what the problem is, but could it be caused by someone (industry-related) uploading junk data? i thought there were safeguards against that kind of thing nowadays."
,Skywize,2008-01-13T02:25Z,Odd. What player do you use? I use VLC and it works perfectly.
,DougieT007,2008-01-15T15:02Z,I use VLC media player too and I am having the same issues as notyourbroom.  I suspect that the file is damaged as well.
