,Colt Python,2008-02-11T08:16Z,"I downloaded this, and I was just wondering, how did u guys managa to get the whole CD 1 to fit in a 700mb cd-r? PLaystation 1 can't read DVD's i believe, so how did u make the game fit?"
,devilpt,2008-02-17T11:44Z,"On CD2 i cant proceede before Cleyra. It's Stupid, I can't find a working Final fantasy 9!!!!"
,Twookeq,2008-03-01T21:45Z,"@ python
Are you burning the iso onto a CD?"
,LiquidBlue,2008-03-05T14:35Z,The game works perfectly. I finished all 4 CDs without any trouble using PSX. (PSXFIN) This emulator is much better and easier to use than EPSXE from my experience.
,mynameisexysam,2008-03-24T20:26Z,"hey!!!!!!! 
but how to use emulator ,
i mean what plugins shud i use & blah blah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,pokerfaced,2008-03-26T23:18Z,can someone come online and seed for me please? im stuck at 79% :( have been for the whole day
,jetnmisery,2008-04-16T01:39Z,"ok i downloaded this and it messes up everytime at the part in dali where the cargo ship is taking off

,unrealize,2008-04-18T16:38Z,"when i enter Cleyra the screen black and cant load anymore

any1 can help???"
,Thenewguy88,2008-04-21T22:29Z,???? no battle menu any help?
,Punchout,2008-04-27T02:44Z,"Okay jetnmisery this is how you do it, When the FMW (movie sequence) start, immideatly press the esc button, then go to file/fil then change disc option. 
Here press iso, now take anyother game iso file and open it.
Now go back to the game and VOILA! You have skipped the FMW and by doing so skipped the crash bug!! .. Now you should go back same procedure but change it to the final fantasy disc 1 img, so the game dosen't crash on you again ;)"
,BoyWithHat,2008-05-18T21:54Z,Please seed!
,blotterchomper,2008-05-19T17:18Z,"I'm guessing you folks who are having problems with the game freezing at Dali are using ePSXe 1.60, download the previous version, 1.52, copy your memory cards to the directory and use that. No glitch!"
,assanessator,2008-05-20T02:08Z,Someone pls help.... i cant burn the disc1 of ff9 coz its more than the size of the blank disc that i have... what will i do?? i appreciate ur help.. thnx..
,assanessator,2008-05-20T02:51Z,"Twookeq... 
there are only two files contaning disc1.. i dont know which of the two is iso.. how will i burn it on a blank cd-r disc? pls.."
,kijl,2008-05-30T01:49Z,"I'm experiencing problems when entering cleyra, when I enter the screen goes black and the game doesn't continue.

I think I have the same problem as devilpt and unrealize.

I'm using ePSXe 1.7.0

If someone knows a way to solve this problem please tell me."
,t68i,2008-06-04T22:06Z,has anyone found a fix to the problem encountered when entering cleyra?
,t68i,2008-06-04T22:30Z,"i found the solution to the ""entering cleyra"" problem, just go download CD2 from this site, i hope u have the game saved before then (saved to memory card file not states)

,wilson1375,2008-06-09T20:21Z,"If you've already gone through the trouble of messing with those rom sites, why don't you post a torrent of disc 2?"
,EnixFalco,2008-06-19T04:18Z,"I also had the error with cleyra, But luckly I made FF9 iso from my own disk. I decided to try my actual disk and it worked. My guess it has something to do with epsxe not being able to play certain FMW's on an ISO. I suggest burning the image to disk and see if that helps."
,zgrav,2008-07-06T03:26Z,"People who got the same problem in Clayre the problem is the savestate don't use it, just save in a memorycard and then refresh the game by the memorycard and it's all fine!!!! i now it's insane but well... it's like that!!! everybody have fun!!!!!!!!! Great torrent btw ;)"
,DanWare,2008-07-16T00:39Z,"Wow - just about every comment is from people who can't get their emulator working right.

At least say thanks for the rom, eh?  Theres nothing wrong with the dump."
,sddsddsdds,2008-07-21T11:12Z,zgrav is GOD he;s right xD ROFLMAo nice find dude

,Kewb,2008-08-08T18:09Z,What is PSX
,DemonsDog,2008-08-09T10:27Z,can i burn this to dvd and play it on a ps3? or is it just a waste of time?
,teh_tpmaster,2008-08-17T16:10Z,"Could anybody shed some light on my situation. Thanks for the torrent, by the way. Ok, I don't know what to do with the files contained in the rar archives. They are .sub .cue .ccd and .img. Help?"
,teh_tpmaster,2008-08-17T16:35Z,I'm a dunce. I had to use SlySoft CopyCD. It works wonders. Thanks for peoples help though....

,cloudsquall,2008-09-03T17:50Z,"blotterchomper is right, if you're going to use epsxe, use version 1.52. no hang in dali and no probels at Cleyra so far (I'm about to finish disc 2) I will update if 3 and 4 are ok too. "
,chepe080,2008-09-06T02:52Z,"I am having a problem with the game.
I am using epsx v1.7 and when I start the game I fight with the boss in the ship then he says ""lets go for the meeting"" and then screen goes black and an error window apears with this ""SPEC Opcode 1 UNK (PC 000ba508) (000ba4f8) (18562,156)"" what should I do?"
,onslaught_789,2008-10-05T13:21Z,"Downloading now.

Would i be right in thinking i can just convert to EBOOT's and run it on my psp or burn them off and use them on my chipped PSX?"
,SickAddict,2008-10-14T00:25Z,seed please...stuck at 69.3% for a few days now.

,lizXoX2008,2009-01-31T05:09Z,"Okay, I am going to help people with this. Make sure you download Daemon Tools. After you download it and install it there should be an icon for it on the tool bar, right click it, go to emulation and make sure safe disc is on so that it is green. Okay so once you have that, and once you have downloaded this file, open your psx emulator, click config, then click cdrom, then click config again, then for the rom letter click F then accept it or whatever then you are done. Then go to your deamon tools and click virtual cd/dvd-rom then put your mouse over device F then click mount image, find your .cue file for disc one then mount it. Then change that image to the second. third and fourth disc when needed. Oh by the way I hope, you already got the bios and used the wizard guide to config everything so it is working properly. "
,Jadunsa,2009-03-21T22:08Z,"Hey I gotta problem with the Disk two.

,ZephirDX,2009-06-08T05:27Z,"I love this game! Thnx for putting it up!

PS. Welcome to the Internets nubs. Learn what an emulator is. Learn what you can or cannot do with a ROM. Don't expect it all to fall in your lap. If you don't understand enough about computers to figure it out, please stick to downloading crappy pop music. I'm tired of seeing comments from mainstream morons complaining about their own ignorance and the heat from copyright sentries they bring.

Thank you."
,Wanash,2009-06-08T15:39Z,"Buy the game, its worth it, then again maybe u don't have ps1/ps2, but its defintly worth buying."
,BloodStainD,2009-06-10T19:30Z,even if you don't have a ps2 or a psx it works even better on an emulator ^.^ espxe is the best one btw (y)

,enderzero,2009-06-18T02:39Z,"Thansk for the torrent, but I'm having troubles burning it to play on my modded PS2. I'm using Alcohol 120% to burn it, bu7t when the game loads up after the initial Playstation logo comes up the sreen pixelates until the loading video is completed, after that it loads the start screen where I can choose to continue or start a new game, and when I click new game the screen goes blank, and that's as far as I can get. Help please?"
,matthewxavier,2009-06-21T15:20Z,"enderzero : are you burning it at the lowest possible speed? also not sure if NTSC or PAL can affect it but maybe? is it on a DVD-R DL? Again, not sure if that is a problem but it's possible?"

,leracos,2010-08-20T11:49Z,"julle777: What emulator are you using? If you are using ePSXe you have to go into your GPU plugin configuration and enable the hotfix on the ""special game fixes"" section to fix the battle error.

As for the rest of you...creating memory cards to use in ePSXe is in the manual (help files) for the emulator. Read that, then come back if you have further problems. Please and thank you.

Working great for me, BTW."
