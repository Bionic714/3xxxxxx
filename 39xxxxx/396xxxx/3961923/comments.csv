,CptIronnutz,2008-07-25T16:31Z,"Great Torrent but there is one thing

The song ''We Are One'' has a ''Dropper'' on it (A malware program that is used to install another for example a back door)

Avast took care of that but in doing so it deleted the song. Does anyone know where I could get the song alone (Tried limewire) ??

Thanks in advance!!"
