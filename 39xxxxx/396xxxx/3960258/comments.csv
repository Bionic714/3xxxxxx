,TaterMySalad,2008-01-08T19:49Z,"This is a really great edit, highly recommended. Blows the original out of the water. 

Oh, Rob Zombie... You went and ruined all the good will you had from me."
,megoto,2008-01-13T12:12Z,Did you remove just sex talk or also nudity?
,HorrorAddict23,2008-03-18T16:43Z,Hello guys! Could someone please help me to tell where can i find a torrent of Rob Zombie's Halloween that has the escape scene that Michael attacked the guards surrounding him while he was getting tranferred? Please help me ~_~
,whatever89,2008-04-21T15:01Z,I can't believe my comment that I didn't like this edit as much a RZ's was removed. How lame are you that you only want possitive comments here? And I was civilized in explaining why. How many other comments were removed?
,Bushca,2008-05-15T03:11Z,OMFG..... what a horribble FAGedit you ended it the wrong way.... cut out the good scenes and should be shot for the blasphemy on sight. Thank you lol
