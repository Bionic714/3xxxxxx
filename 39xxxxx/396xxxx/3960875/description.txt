_____________________________________________________________Summary__

In Guatemala today, women are being raped, mutilated and murdered in 
their thousands. Maria Isabel was one of more than 1,500 Guatemalan 
women who have been murdered in the last four years. This documentary
investigates how a man can escape a rape charge if he marries his 
victim provided she is over the age of 12 and having sex with a minor
is only an offence if the girl can prove she is Ã¢??honest' and did not
provoke the attack. In some Guatemalan communities it is accepted
that fathers can introduce their daughters to sex and a battered
wife can only prosecute her husband if her injuries are visible for
more than ten days. 

In this culture of violence, where women are the prey, attacks have 
become accepted, even common place. Their murderers know they stand 
little chance of being caught because most murders are never 
investigated and no one is charged. Today, in Guatemala City, barely
a day goes by that a mother, a student or a housewife isn't found 
dead. Rosa Franco says she will not stop demanding justice for the 
murder of her teenage daughter Maria Isabel even though both she 
and her teenage sons are constantly intimidated by those she thinks 
may be responsible for her brutal killing.
