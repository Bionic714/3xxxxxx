,jerd,2008-01-04T17:36Z,nice of you nobian; I was about to do it after I read the other comment; will seed
,nobian,2008-01-04T18:18Z,"Hi jerd!

Unfortunately I have those problems with torrents...Can't gave open ports, so upload is slow. I thought of uploading it to Rapidshare..."
,nobian,2008-01-04T18:20Z,"Jerd, can you seed it from/for this torrent? I mean you too have that version...Don't know if it is possible or not..

Thank you very much anyways!"
,jerd,2008-01-04T18:21Z,"afternoon nobian; I am seeding it right now!
don't worry about it anymore; it's going quite fast at my end :)"
,jerd,2008-01-04T18:23Z,"yes nobian, I had the same version so I am using it to seed this torrent"
,nobian,2008-01-04T18:31Z,"Dear Jerd,

Thank you very much indeed!

Have a nice day!

P.S:Anyways, I was told that this software barely deserves even a key-loader. It was low-prestige job for the cracker, so there won't be any new ones..."

,newstips,2008-01-05T04:10Z,"I removed the 2.00.26 version and installed this .23 version. The keyloader still complains ""Code not found! Please check software version and instructions!"" 
I have tried 2.00.23 setup on an XP machine too but the same complaint is there! I have even tried to run the keyloader with Admin privilages.
Any suggestions?
Thanks"

I am entering a username with 6 alphabets and then click OK at which Mercurius complains that the serial is invalid. At this time I hit ""Get Serial"" on the keyloader . I have also tried to close only the  warning message box and not the ""Enter User Name and Serial Number"" dialog and then hit Get Serial. Have also tried to run the keyloader from the Mercurius directory and also keeping the HCC.nfo file with it. No luck.

Thanks"
,nobian,2008-01-05T15:33Z,"Hi Newsbits!

To be honest, I have no clue.. I would have thought it's Vista, but then you have XP...
But if you truly need the SW, please give me some means that I can contact you.

Cheers!"
,nobian,2008-01-05T15:37Z,"By the way.. The keygen even works with v.2.0.26 here, I just tried it..."
,newstips,2008-01-05T21:56Z,"Hi Nobian,
Thanks for your reply.
I was initially struggling on a Vista machine. Then I have tried on two XP machines but had no luck.
If email is enough then I am at newstips@fastmail.fm
Please suggest if you need some better way to contact. 
Thanks"
,newstips,2008-01-06T06:16Z,"I could bypass the problems on the XP machine by using Safe Mode. It worked!
With the Vista machine here, even in safe mode it is not working."
,nobian,2008-01-06T11:52Z,"Dear newstips!

Interesting, really! :) One never ceases to learn. By the way, I hope that you know, that you can now update to .26, the licenses work...

Have a nice day!"
,marivo,2008-04-25T18:06Z,"nobian, please give me a help. initially the soft worked, but after a month stoped working. I tried to reinstall the soft but this time the keygen didn't work. can you give me a help. 
I suspect that the program blocked the keygen beacause initially the keygen worked"
