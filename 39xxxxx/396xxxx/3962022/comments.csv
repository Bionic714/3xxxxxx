[T],verifire,2008-10-24T18:39Z,"Dear ""sistromo"". Since you clearly haven't been told that the fact that there exists so much material referring to Jesus of Nazareth and the things He said and did (yes, even contemporary non-Christian historians etc.), it will take a lot more hard-headed (and-hearted?) faith NOT to believe that He existed than to believe it. Don't you believe me? :-) Check out the documentary: ""The Case For Christ"", serious research by a journalist who started out believing it was just a lie, like you maybe do. Or maybe you don't want to find out more about Jesus? Hope that's not the case.. Lots o' love from me.. :-)"
[T],verifire,2008-10-25T11:55Z,"I feel I need too say a little more, since this movie (The Case For Christ's Resurrection) partially contains material about the so called ""shroud of turin"", wich some believe is the actual sheet of linen Jesus' body was wrapped in when He was laid in the tomb. I don't believe that, but when it comes down to the really important facts about his Life, sacrificial death and then resurrection and how His Spirit can transform both your life and death to something amazing, I do believe. Because It's been proven to me.. :-)"
