,Ganondorf1,2008-01-19T18:14Z,"i downloaded these games from http://www.noeman.org/ and i just put them to share. so i am not responsabile from viruses you may find. i dont know how they got there and as i said, they are checked with Norton internet security 15.0.0.60 before uploading."

,Ganondorf1,2008-10-22T20:10Z,"@Xaveouis

You must have the USB-cable or connect your phone somehow to the computer. Then if you have some program(propably came with the phone) which can install the apps directly from your pc, it shouldn't be hard... otherwise transfer files into your phone by copying the .jar(/.sis/.sisx)-file of your choise to somewhere in your phone (memorycard/phone memory). Now you should be able to find it by your phone and install it...
--> let me know if you have any troubles, I'll be happy to help :)"

,nishitmv,2009-03-24T18:33Z,Thnx mate :) and y the fck r noobs allowed to comment . dont the N00Bs understand that the signature of keygens are similar to that of trojans and the antivirus gets fooled all the time ? stop posting noobish comments please
,mrpras,2009-09-21T13:03Z,"@nishitmv - please try to be more friendly.

We are all noobs in some ways, in your case you are obviously a social noob. Please try not to vent your frustration here, and keep on topic.

Facts are - Keygens are Malware - they give you codes to bypass the legal security system so Virus scanners and so on WILL try to catch them also.

The downside is that these Keygens can also contain Trojans and other types of malware such as spyware. So use at your own risk."
