All songs and arrangements written and programmed by Adronus.  
Originally formed as a side project to his regular music CB, realized that it may actually go somewhere, so he started recording various beats, samples, guitar riffs, piano pieces, and instrument arrangements.  

While the music almost always retains the same amount of lengthiness, the theme of each of the two albums is significantly different.
Album 1, The Calm, is more ambient, consisting of two songs that, together, run well over an hour.  It keeps on the same paths as Bass Communion and Vidna Obmana.
Album 2, takes a different approach, mixing the elements of drone and metal, similar to the likes of Sunn 0))), Neurosis, and a little Merzbow.

Hope you enjoy the songs as much as I enjoyed making them.
