I thank you for the up but please for future reference. Don't compress a vid. "
,starkoman,2009-08-31T00:44Z,"Well Verthik, which would you rather find: A corruption in a 4.2GB video file or one of the small RAR files (which you can checksum and re-download)?

Yes, it IS an extra step but no pain.

Buy an extra hard drive - they're not expensive: you can get a 750GB IDE Drive on eBay for ÂŁ90. After all, you ARE getting the film for free!"
