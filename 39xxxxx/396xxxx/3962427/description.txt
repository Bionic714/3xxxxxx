-- River Past ShadowTunes
Use iTunes, sync to everything. Do you have an iPod? Do you use iTunes? You are not alone. Over 100 million iPod users use iTunes to manage their video and audio media files. It is a good media manager. However, iPod is not the only device you use. You have cell phones, and probably not iPhones, and most of the newer cell phones can play video and audio. You may have some other portable players, like Archos or Sansa. So, you have a problem managing your media library. Yes, you can get all of them into iTunes with some good conversion software, and for that purpose, we would like to recommend our Crazi Video. However, you probably don't want to maintain multiple media libraries, each for a different cell phone or portable player model. This is why we made ShadowTunes. Use iTunes, sync to everything. You select which iTunes playlist you want to sync, and click the "Sync" button. All we require is that you have the device connected to the PC as an USB storage device. We copy the files if the file format is compatible, or convert it if necessary. We place the files in their correct location. Everything is done automatically. Right now, it supports Blackberry Pearl 8100 series, 8300 series, 8800 series, Sony Ericsson Walkman W200, W300, W550, W580, W600, W610, W660, W800, W810, W830, W850, W880, W900, W910, W950, W960, Sandisk Sansa E250, E260, E280 and Sansa View, and Archos players. Additional devices will be added as free minor upgrades. Note, we don't sync DRM protected audio and video files - the ones you purchased on iTunes. No adware or spyware.
