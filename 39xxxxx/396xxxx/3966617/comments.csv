,SatanManofPeace,2008-01-08T23:41Z,"Hi Just.A.Average.Jerk.
The Pirate Bay has this lovely feature called the ""search bar"" It allows you to type in text, and torrents similar to the input text will pop-up. Now, I'm sure you know that numerous people upload comic torrents. Since TheDarkelf has been kind enough to compile the work of fellow scanners and keep us leechers up to date, wouldn't it be ideal to type in ""DCP"" into the search bar? It only seems resonable since they do zero day comics. Lo and behold, I found what you were looking for in this pack, http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3956102/DCP__amp__Friends_12-31-07#filelistContainer 
Not to far back in fact. You could also click TheDarkelf's username, because that's a hyperlink. Yes, a hyperlink that will take you to a list of all the wonderful torrents that he/she uploaded.
So to sum up. You type in the search bar to find torrents. That can range from DCP, SBM, h33t (people like smokebogey or jousha13) packs."

Thanks."
