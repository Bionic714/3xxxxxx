CIMARRON STRIP (1967)
The Cimarron Strip was the border region between the Kansas Territory and Indian Territory during the late 19th century. Patrolling this vast area was the job of U.S. Marshal Jim Crown (Stuart Whitman). Crown, who worked out of Cimarron City, was assigned no deputies, so he often counted on grizzled Scotsman MacGregor (Percy Herbert), green photographer Francis (Randy Boone) or cute hotel owner Dulcey (Jill Townsend) for help

103. BROKEN WING  (9/21/1967)
There is trouble in Cimarron when Jing McQueen, the drunken and simple-minded son of wealthy cattleman Mike McQueen, shoots a local preacher and burns down a livery stable. When the preacher recovers, he refuses to press charges, and McQueen is released from jail, leaving Marshal Crown to control an angry lynch mob.
