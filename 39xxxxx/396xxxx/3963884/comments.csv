,tejas9999,2008-01-07T18:27Z,Is this the Unabridged version ???
,jman1200mk2,2008-01-21T07:45Z,"Yes, why is this one so big, and no one is downloading it.  The other one is only 64 KBPS so I guess that it would make sence that this one is of better quality and therefore larger.  Makes you wonder though......."

,foxmajik,2008-06-30T02:52Z,"Most of the ideas expressed in this book are no longer applicable in today's world.  You have to do a lot of interpolation to the point that the material is essentially useless.  ""A firm pat on the bottom is an excellent reward for a job well done!"""
