,Stclaws,2008-09-09T08:51Z,Does the generated serial and activation code work on Mac too?
,8475647476574,2008-09-15T14:58Z,"Nice, but:

I'm installing the program on a Mac. Now the problem is that the keygen.exe, that I run on a PC, gernerates the Serial, but when I click to get the activation code, a warning pops up and tells me I need to install the program (Vue) first. Well, I HAVE installed Vue, only not on this PC.

So how can I get this keygen.exe to spit out the activation code?"

To answer 8475647476574's question (nice username by the way)

It is possible to activate it on the mac, but you do need a PC to do it or boot camp. 

- First Install it on your mac, then open up Vue 6 Infinite.reg (just search for it in finder) 

- open it up in text edit. Write down the Mac Address. (do not worry about activation yet)

- Now install Vue Infinite on the PC using the keygen (Do not close the keygen after the installation, as Seck pointed out)

-> IMPORTANT  Now replace the Mac Address with one you wrote down from the first step. Close it and save. 

- Now open up Vue, and click the activation generate code. WRITE DOWN THIS CODE. This code is the activation code for your Mac. 

That is how you install Vue 6.0 on mac.

(I am not a Mac ahole, but Vue works better on my Mac than on my PC.) So it is worth the pain in the ass to get it on mac. 


Thanks seck for the upload.
