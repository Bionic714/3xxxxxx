 Join Master Gunsmith Robert "Bob" Dunlap as he shows you all the ins and outs of the Remington 700 Rifle. Bob teaches you complete disassembly and assembly (not just field stripping!), parts identification, proper cleaning and lubrication. We give you step-by-step instruction in design, function and repair, including locking systems, feeding systems, sears, and triggers. Stocks are also covered along with easy repairs for common problems. Bob will take you inside this rifle and show you what each part is supposed to do and how to maintain and repair it.
