Another of my favorite Burt Lancaster westerns.  Plays a mexican descent deputy sheriff to the mexican side of a white town.  Good action but also thought provoking.

Once again we are reminded that we do not know a person's past, so you never know/expect the result of ticking someone off.  It is the movie equivalent of a guy in a bar confrontation thinking the other guy beat up on the floor while the other guy already sees you with your throat ripped out and bleeding to death.

Wide screen, color, excellent quality, English only, no subs, avi format


IMDB plot line.
The town constable, Bob Valdez, is forced to kill someone accused by Frank Tanner of being a murderer. Valdez asks Tanner for monetary help for the man's wife, but he is ridiculed and almost killed by Tanner's henchmen. Valdez recovers and summons up his days in the U.S. Cavalry in order to fight them. Valdez wounds one of the henchmen and sends him back to Tanner with the message, "Valdez is coming."
