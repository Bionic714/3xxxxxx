""impossible to find the version.Instal correct version before apply patch."""
,NuDub,2008-01-12T23:10Z,"Maybe I must install 7.0.1 and after the 7.0.2.

My actual version is 7.0"
,fireonline,2008-01-15T06:50Z,"Yes, install 7.01 update first then 7.02"
,pfsv666,2008-02-07T07:41Z,"I want to know if somebody have the 7.0.1 update, because I have Sonar 7.0  Produce and I want to install this new update (7.0.2)."
[T],JMUTHAFUKND,2008-03-05T03:26Z,"IS IT A 7.0.1 PATCH  OR  CAN WE UPDATE FROM THE SONAR WEBSITE??? I TO WOULD LIKE TO UPDATE TO 7.0.2
PLEASE  THANK YOU MUCH RESPECT!!!!!!"
,drummerguystevegmail,2008-03-19T03:43Z,I can't read the serial/reg. key that I wrote on the disc.  I also can't find the original torrent any more.  Does anyone still have that info?
,ryan21255,2008-03-28T01:31Z,"You don't need to download this update via torrents because you can get Sonar updates from the website, even if you have a version that was gotten by ""unlawful means."" This site should get you the first two updates: http://www.cakewalk.com/Support/default.asp while this one will give you the third that just came out: http://www.cakewalk.com/Support/kb/kb20080207.asp of course you only need the third update if you are having problems with you ASIO drivers, which I have been experiencing. I would get the third update anyway seeing that you will need it for when and if there is a forth update to Sonar 7. Yes, you need 7.0.1 before you can get 7.0.2. So save yourself some time and download from Sonar's website, and use the time that you would be downloading this patch and get yourself some new porn. After all, you deserve it. "
