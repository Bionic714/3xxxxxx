PLOT LINE:

Maggie, a 50-year-old widow - still faithful to her dead
husband, desperately needs some money to pay for a medical
treatment for her ill grandson. After several unfruitful
attempts to find a job, Maggie finds herself roaming the
streets of London Soho. Her eye is caught by a small poster
in the window of a 'shop' called "Sexy World" which reads:
"Hostess wanted". Too desperate and lost to realize what
she does she enters. Micky, the owner, is embarrassed at
first, but intrigued by Maggie, he decides to have fun and
offers her the job. Under the pseudonym of Irina Palm, Maggie
courageously gets to know her first anonymous customers.
Micky observes his recruit. Maggie, who applies herself in
order to keep her job, fascinates him. When she does something,
she makes sure she does it well.
