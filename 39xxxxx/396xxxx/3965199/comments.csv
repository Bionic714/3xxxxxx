,jvezirian,2011-05-20T01:49Z,"Worked fantastic without any installations issues on Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit. Made sure to run install as administrator and also the game launcher.

Only error, it said my video drivers were out of date, but hell it is brand new rig, and first thing I did was to go to ATI and update all the drivers and everything, so wrote that one off.

Great upload."
