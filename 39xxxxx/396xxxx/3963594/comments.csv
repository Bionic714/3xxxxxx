,shinjukublack,2008-01-07T21:30Z,"@ xjlm: I guess they took your advice :)

Hey... is anyone going to help seed this? This is an awesome torrent and it would be great to get it in less than a few months..."
,shinjukublack,2008-01-08T00:00Z,"kreeture, please seed.

0.188 availability and no speed are the makings of a dead torrent. "
,shinjukublack,2008-01-10T19:54Z,"Dead, dead, DEAD torrent.

This thing has been dead since it started... was never even seeded to 100%.

Nice work, kreeture."
,strangehammer,2008-02-02T11:01Z,"i had a hard drive failure, and lost all my torrent files, all the video files i still have.  Is there a way to move all the videos to a folder and have it start seeding again?  If so I will, I was seeding when I first put it up for a week before the hard drive crashed."
,strangehammer,2008-02-02T20:47Z,Seeding now...
,strangehammer,2008-02-16T15:18Z,dead? 5 seeders now.
,junk90731,2008-03-15T20:54Z,"xbox 360 now supports other video formats besides wma, i just downloaded the update yesterday.  click on a .avi video file it will ask if you want to do an update and that's it."
,klezmik,2008-07-05T19:13Z,"excellent collection, a pitty it is wmv, but no complaining about it..."
,quizbuddy,2008-07-30T17:19Z,This seems to be trailers only. Why?
,quizbuddy,2008-08-31T14:53Z,"WHY DID YOU PUT 13,4 GB OF TRAILERS WITHOUT MAKING A NOTE ABOUT IT - YOU KREETURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

ALL OF THE FILES ARE ONLY APP. 4 MIN. LONG"
,copylegal,2010-12-16T16:30Z,"put this torrent in again!
says torrent is nonexistent"
,qwertybnm,2011-06-08T23:34Z,"Not to attack the uploader, who after all warned us what he was uploading. BUT, these are in a cruddy old WMV format that is patented by Microsoft, so freeware remuxing programs can't even remux it, ie turn it into a useful format like mkv or avi. So you are pretty much stuck with WMV v.1 videos if you download this. 

My computer will play it, but it won't play on my HTPC box, and I guess it won't play on any handheld devices or streamers either. So avoid it unless you are happy with WMVs..."
