Cry of Love's debut was a near-perfect fusion of classic British hard-rock influences (read Free) and Southern rock sensibility, bringing a refreshing honesty to the dreary radio landscape of the early '90s. Vocalist Kelly Holland's gritty delivery (at times reminiscent of Billy Squier) is a perfect foil for the Hendrix flourishes of guitarist Audley Freed, resulting in stellar moments like "Highway Jones," "Pretty as You Please," and the grinding "Hand Me Down." Vying for the crown as the band's best song are the two radio staples: "Bad Thing" with its thumping bassline and effusive hand claps, and "Peace Pipe," a genuine counter-culture anthem for the '90s. ~ Ed Rivadavia, All Music Guide
