,istealmusic69,2008-02-01T20:46Z,yes it should but only if you installed the crack then this should stay at 30 days that is if you have the crack if not search for a crack
,turn2dust,2008-03-03T19:50Z,if you were using a legit dell system it would not ask you to activate at all.

,Marcusz07,2011-05-12T10:14Z,What Speed To Burn It At ?
,spreadthewealth,2011-12-26T21:57Z,"I am downloading this edition just to have in case someone wants a re-load.  Downloading right now, I am pulling in 1.3Megs of speed, and its plodding along quite nicely.  The reviews are about typical of an OEM iso install, if Genuine dell it works fine without a problem, but if homebuilt or off brand computer, it gives an activation warning.  Also, in case some of you did not know, there are a BUNCH of dell Optiplex cases out there on ebay for sale for almost nothing that have stickers still on them for keys.  I just got 2 of them for $40, a GX260 with windows 2000 professional, and a GX280 with XP professional keys/stickers on them.  "
