Fyodor Dostoyevsky, The Idiot (Abridged) - 3 Discs 
 
http://www.amazon.com/Idiot-Classic-Literature-Classical-Music/dp/9626340592
Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, justly acclaimed for their translations of such Russian classics as Gogol\'s Dead Souls and Dostoyevski\'s The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment and Notes from Underground, have now undertaken another major Dostoyevski novel, The Idiot. Their trademark style fresh, crisp and faithful to the original (bumps and blemishes included) brings the story of nave, truth-telling Prince Myshkin to new life. As is true of their other translations of Dostoyevski, this will likely be the definitive edition for years to come.
