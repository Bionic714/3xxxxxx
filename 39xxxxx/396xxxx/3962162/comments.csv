but

don't install this is you have XP service pack 3 beta installed (released 18/12/07)which is a pity as service pack 3 gives around a 10% system performance increase

they don't like each other, you wont be able to change the themes afterwards.

tried on 2 laptops, home pc and my works pc, same result on all four machines"
