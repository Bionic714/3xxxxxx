12 short features from the bonus disc of the 'Aliens Special Edition' DVD.

These 12 are examples of great movie-making in their own right (well, the first 11 anyway), with excellent writing and production. The combined size of this torrent is large but it does NOT contain the main films. These are short films about how writer and director James Cameron's cinematic opus 'Aliens' was made. If you loved the movie (and who didn't?) then you'll like these featurettes. It seems a lot of effort was put into making them (maybe to justify to consumers another outlay of cash, but I digress...) These are good even if you just want to learn behind-the-scenes film-making techniques of the big budget films of the 1980's.

Seems the new film Aliens vs. Predator Requiem is a really popular torrent right now.

2 quotes from the film:

"Hudson (played by actor Bill Paxton): [during the drop] I'm ready, man, check it out. I am the ultimate badass! State of the badass art! You do NOT want to fuck with me. Check it out! Hey Ripley, don't worry. Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you! Check it out! Independently targeting particle beam phalanx. Whoa! Fry half a city with this puppy. We got tactical smart missiles, phase-plasma pulse rifles, RPGs, we got sonic electronic ball breakers! We got nukes, we got knives, sharp sticks..."

"Hudson: Hey Vasquez, have you ever been mistaken for a man?"
"Vasquez: No... Have you?"
