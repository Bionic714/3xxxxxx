A pattern in chaos. An organised disorder. A script to an event that cannot be predicted. ThatÂ´s what the name Script Of Flood stands for. ItÂ´s a headline for a hard rock act with beautiful melodies, buzzing guitars and stories about human emotions. Founded in year 2000 by lead vocalist Pexi HyvÃ¤rinen, Script Of Floods present line-up is five years old and located in Helsinki, Finland. A northern melancholy meets wall of sound in a rock nÂ´roll decadence. Started as a PexiÂ´s solo project, later expanded to a band, Script Of Flood made their first demo in 2002. The five track EP called Â´WitheredÂ´ defined the genre for the band for years to come. Script Of FloodÂ´s mix of American rock and Scandinavian metal received good reviews and some airplay on national radio-stations. After a couple critically acclaimed demos and numerous live shows the band started to record their first full-length album. The finnish producer T.T. Oksala (HIM, Apocalyptica, Lordi) was chosen to produce the album. Recorded in Crystal Sound studios and Kikeono Film Sound studios the album titled Â´Cue To ExitÂ´ was mixed by Teropekka Virtanen (CMX, 51 Koodia, Technicolour) in Crystal Sound studios, Helsinki in the end of 2006. The backing vocals were tributed by Anzi Destruction from Stereo Junks and Jami PietilÃ¤ End of You. Â´Cue To ExitÂ´ as Pexi puts it: Eleven songs from anxiety and frustration. Songs from leaving and letting go. An album title with a countless of interpretations. An album that captures Script Of Flood as we are today. Hard rocking, slightly metal and highly emotional. Â´Cue to ExitÂ´really holds songs for everybody. Fast, rockinÂ´ tunes, midtempo and mellow songs as well as slow and almost doomishâ tracks. For a band that has already gained a solid fanbase after a many years of hard work playing and composing Â´Cue To ExitÂ´ is a really strong debut. S&P Records is proud to released Script Of FloodÂ´s first single Â´ReplicaÂ´ in October 2007 along with a music video directed by P.J. Piippo. Script Of FloodÂ´s debut album Â´Cue to ExitÂ´ was released in 26th of November 2007.
