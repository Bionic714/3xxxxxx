The original Two-Gun Kid, Clay Harder, was Marvel's first continuing western character, appearing in Two-Gun Kid #1 (194 and continuing off and on until 1962, with Joe Sinnott being the last artist to draw the original Kid on a regular basis. The second Two-Gun Kid, Matt Liebowicz (alias "Matt Hawk"--the Liebowicz name was eventually retconned in to replace the original "Hawk", first appeared in Two-Gun Kid #60 (1962). The latter Kid is better known today, thanks primarily to his connection with and later full integration into the Marvel Universe, not to mention simply being more recent, but the earlier Kid enjoyed a prolific 14-year life span in comics. Two-Gun Kid #60 retconned the Clay Harder character out of existence, turning him into a dime novel character (at a time when comics had just gone up in price from a dime to twelve cents). The two Kids wore different outfits: Clay Harder had bright blond hair and wore an all-black suit with a plackard shirt, a broad-brimmed black hat, and packed two long-barreled pistols with individual overlapping gun belts, while Matt Hawk wore a similar outfit only with an orange-and-black spotted vest, a slightly narrower-brimmed hat, two pistols on a single gun belt, and a black mask covering the top half of his face in the Zorro style. At one point later in the second series, some of the original Kid's adventures were retouched to make him look like the newer Kid for reprints! Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, creators of the Fantastic Four, concocted the new Kid to make the character resemble a superhero with a secret identity in order to stimulate sales for the title.
