,QBMan,2008-01-08T15:37Z,I have this working on a NON DELL PC!! Use the Paradox BIOS Emulation program :-) Passes Windows WGA test :-)
[T],mm3_hellraiser,2008-01-10T20:02Z,"BIOS emulation won't work for much longer (on later releases of Vista, anyway) because Microsoft is working on a fix for the BIOS emu.

Also; All the OEM disks are 32-Bit."

Is there somewhere hidden in the directories a keygen or something else to remove the 30 days activation lock?"

,itsnex,2008-07-27T18:06Z,I'll be seeding for about 10 hours or so while i sleep. my upload speed for my connection is 400KB/s so that should be good for people that are barely torrenting this :)

,vadee,2009-07-07T17:46Z,Does anyone have the HP OEM version of Vista Business 32bit? Thanks in advance!
,charles-atlas,2011-01-17T23:00Z,"All mayor brands of pc haves hard-to-find recovery images disc. Almost Acer and HP comes with recovery utility to write on dvd the recovery media (old times of Winxp also can write into iso files).
Try the new 2011 Dell OEM dvd (search torrent in this browser) to install a clean Vista Bus SP1. Comes with Spanish-English-Portugues options and is usefull to make a new clean install, using your own key (the torrent dont include)."
