 As i promised, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2003 Season 1, re-riped with better
 quality (and with some fixes, like English audio tracks for last 2 episodes).
 Can't really say anything else about it.
 Oh, well, i can. This season features the best animation (drawing) quality of all.
 At some points you may just want to hit pause and look at the picture.
 A pity we won't see anything like this again - Season 7 will have simplyfied art.
