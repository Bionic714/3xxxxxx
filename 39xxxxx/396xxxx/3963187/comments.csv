,dominik_387,2008-03-20T10:22Z,"I don't understand. It says that spoken language is English and Russian, but they speak only Russian :( "
,dominik_387,2008-03-20T10:48Z,"I solve the problem :) I only needed to switch audio stream. This is very good quality movies. Seed guys, this must to be seed forever!!!"
,Wisuguysuya,2008-04-10T00:30Z,"So what software do you guys use to watch this, neither VLC, CCCP pack or WMP will work..."
,Wisuguysuya,2008-04-10T03:25Z,"Nvm, works wonders if you just let the whole downloading complete, cannot watch on 95% or similar :/"
,Leonardo1337,2008-04-10T21:05Z,gay Russia language.. isin't there English language? None can't understand that lol :D 
,Leonardo1337,2008-04-11T01:26Z,OHH!! You can switch the language to english didin't know :D i have been looking for these Episodes! Finally found em! :D niceee!!! :D:D:D:D 
,LRN,2008-04-15T11:51Z,"Myself, i recommend K-Lite Mega Codec Pack, choose ""lots of stuff"" at installation, and then change everything to ffmpeg and Gabest.

Yes, you finally mastered the art of audio stream switching. I'm proud of you :)"
,LRN,2008-04-15T16:19Z,ffmpeg ~ ffdshow
,ansatsuken007,2008-04-28T00:03Z,"I'm having a problem! I can't view episode 12, 17 and 18, it just switches to episode 1. It's the same on some episodes on the later seasons too. Am I doing something wrong or are those episodes glitchy?"
,LRN,2008-05-03T09:36Z,"Sorry, can't help. Each episode is a separate file. If you're ""switching"" to 1st episode, it's probably your player playing tricks with you..."
,vipertongn,2008-06-09T08:43Z,"Please continue to seed, This is superb thanks XD"
,palur,2008-06-30T23:41Z,"I think there is missing 3 episodes, the three first ones...   or is it just me?"
,LRN,2008-07-08T22:44Z,It's just you.
,HaddySkelly,2008-10-23T04:18Z,"OKay, I'm very new to this, so please don't 'tsk' at me if it's sort of an obvious thing. But at the moment, when I play my TMNT ep's on itunes, it plays both Russian and English. I can still understand the English, but it would make things easier if I could turn off the Russian. Does anybody know how I could do this?"
,kdawg69,2008-11-14T10:32Z,"Is this the original Season 1.
Or is this some remastered stuff."
,LRN,2008-11-30T02:55Z,"HaddySkelly, i think your player doesn't have stream switcher (thingy that allows it to play either one or another stream). I don't know how to fix that for iTunes. Other players shouldn't have this problem.

kdawg69, original Season 1. Just higher quality than before (i've made another release of this season two years ago, but this release is better)."
,moonlotus,2009-01-12T05:36Z,"I'm trying to view this in Quicktime (only program that it will play in -_- ) and its doing the same thing as HaddySkelly, playing both languages at the same time and no way to fix it. "
,LRN,2009-01-28T14:48Z,Quicktime sux. Don't use it.
,shaban96,2009-09-27T17:44Z,thnx buddy. i was wondering will u be uploading the season 7 back to the sewer. please let us know
,lataman,2010-10-28T02:12Z,"LRN, could you PLEASE tell me which software do you use for ripping series? (specially like this)
How did you deinterlace the episodes without losing quality? (using this software)"
,LRN,2011-01-12T16:11Z,"Deinterlace is done with Decomb (Telecide function)
I've used, as far as i can remember, meGUI."
,Flame2032,2012-02-12T09:45Z,"uhh how do i switch the language O.o
do i need a program to do it with?"
,LRN,2012-03-27T12:22Z,"Any half-decent media player (that is, VLC, *mplayer, MediaPlayerClassic, Gnome player) would offer you an ability (usually - via its main menu) to switch audio tracks. Read the manual."
,uniquue,2012-04-22T14:04Z,Please seed this NOW i really wanna see what happens in the episodes in this season :(
