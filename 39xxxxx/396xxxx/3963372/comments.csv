,sppaz,2008-01-06T02:22Z,"yes this is the newest.

WEB RIP

Thank you thank you!"
,rathalos,2008-01-06T04:42Z,"Quality is absolutely terrible. But this is the only rip of this episode available atm. So if you are an addict like me, you will like this."
,chopiesel,2008-01-06T07:00Z,anyone else having probs with part 3? mine only runs for about 4 seconds.
,yeyo90***,2008-01-06T07:46Z,no... plays fine
,Xilence,2008-01-06T12:03Z,"For rathalos, the quality is perfectly fine. you must have a REALLY shitty FLV player"
,donpedro,2008-01-06T13:12Z,"Worst format, container and quality. Even if you are an addict you should be able to wait for a real rip."
,heinzon,2008-01-06T15:11Z,"Looks perfect too me, i mean common its a silly (but great show) its not like you're watching Transformers or whatever and need great quality of picture + sound. Hmm weird though that ""who can commit the most crime"" ep didn't show up. I can't even find this ep on tv.com. Anyway thank you Xilence for this rip you rule. "
,dawnvito,2008-01-06T16:33Z,"avi would of been nice , but wtf .
THANKS !"
,livingdots,2008-01-06T18:41Z,WTF! I have to settle for Youtube-quality now... ?! Isn't there anybody in Canada that can make a decent rip of this show?
,ChiLLaZ,2008-01-06T18:59Z,Isn't this the pilot episode =o ?
,ChiLLaZ,2008-01-06T19:03Z,"""Who can commit more crime"" ep will air on the eight ..

,sppaz,2008-01-06T22:46Z,You ungrateful fucks are the reason why people don't upload as much.  IF YOU DONT WANT IT DONT DOWNLOAD IT.   go to youtube you fucking homo and watch it there. don't bitch to the uploader if you dont like the quality.  why not complain to showcase.ca CAUSE THATS WHERE IT'S FROM.   I found the quality great for TV douchebags.
,sppaz,2008-01-06T22:52Z,"@Xilence  
remove the torrent from these ungrateful bitching fucks.  "
,livingdots,2008-01-07T01:18Z,"Hey, sppaz, I'm glad _YOU_ found the quality ""great for TV"", but this does not look ""perfect"" for those of us that have HDTVs and can actually see -- unlike like you, you poor SDTV-having glaucoma-suffering pissant. Coz' let's be honest here: This is a WEB-RIP, and the quality is hence YOU-MOTHER-FUCKING-TUBE-LIKE.

You can get the same shit here:

And what the hell is wrong with the Canadians? There are 33 million of them, and they are supposed to have among the highest standard of living in the world, but _NONE_ of them can provide us with high-quality rips of this show. Canadians, you ought be ashamed of yourselves.

I'm just saying.

BTW, this is episode 409, *not* the pilot. Episode 410, ""Who Can Commit the Most Crime?"", hasn't aired yet."
,picard77,2008-01-07T01:53Z,"livingdots
Who gives a shit about who of you have HDTV or any other equipment, that is SO irrelevant.
Should everyone get confirmation from you everytime they upload stuf, to make sure its up to your standards? The point is that YOU DONT HAVE TO LIKE IT, and even better: we dont have to care."
,sppaz,2008-01-07T02:32Z,"@livingdots
This was upp'd 1 day after it was on tv.  I have nothing against canadians you idiot, I was talking shit about the scum that bitches and moans because a webrip doesn't look good on daddy's 52"" plasma TV.

BTW : TVrip 167MB is now released so quit yar bitching"
,livingdots,2008-01-07T05:03Z,"I was just stating my opinion, which for sake of clarity is: You have got to have your head up your ass (or have glaucoma like spastic-sppaz) if you are seriously saying this rip ""looks perfect"", is ""great for TV"" and has ""perfectly fine [quality]"". Calling a web-rip ""Youtube-quality"" -- like i did, is a far more fair and accurate description of the quality provided here. That's all. I was describing the fucking quality, for the benefit of people considering downloading this. Deal with it however you please, picard77 and others, I don't give a shit."
,Freiheit.14,2008-01-07T06:17Z,"Where can one find the TVrip, sppaz?"
,matthewriot,2008-01-07T16:18Z,"Yeah where can we find the 167 MB Torrent for this episode, sppaz?  I searched everywhere, didn't find shiiiaaattt!"
,Deznaj,2008-01-08T15:49Z,"I'm sorry, but it's better to have nothing than to have this crap.

For those who don't see the bad quality (like Xilence), get a seeing eye dog."
,isik_oromoyo,2008-01-08T16:59Z,YOU UNGRATEFUL FUCKS!!! Every part works fine! the quality is fine if you use VLC Media Player! So stop be so fucking stupid and update ur video progs..
,Freiheit.14,2008-01-08T19:53Z,"The quality is perfectly adequate, and blows up on my 22"" monitor just fine. If anyone's having issues, update your programs. I'm looking for the tvrip because I'm weird and all the episodes on my computer all have to be the same format. It also makes it easier to put on dvd. If anyone comes across the TVrip, it would be appreciated."
,jordansky,2008-01-09T05:20Z,This is S04E09
,yeyo90***,2008-01-09T06:55Z,"there is no flaw on the encoding here. its uncompressed web rip, and could not been done better with the source"
,stikEmata,2008-01-09T16:40Z,"woooo hoooooooooo!


looks like last night's ep is being seeded over at mininova in the usual .avi format.


This .flv version was watchable... but the 3 parts was annoying to me."

,BadCash,2008-01-12T13:17Z,"The quality was definitely watchable, and come on - those of you complaining about having to load 3 files in a playlist should really consider running for the ""Laziest guy of the year""-award... "
