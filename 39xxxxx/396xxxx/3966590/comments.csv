After you finish to download 100%, extract the both files from rar archives, .mp4, and .thm and rename the files MAQ20012.mp4 and MAQ20011.thm. U have to create a new folder inside the MP_ROOT named 100ANV01, and have to move this two renamed files here.
/MP_ROOT/100ANV01/MAQ20012.MP4
/MP_ROOT/100ANV01/MAQ20012.THM
In this order and format will work 100%, tested by myself, sorry about this, I just see it today.
