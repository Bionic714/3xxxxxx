,spherehead,2008-01-06T23:25Z,How about uploading these in a format everyone uses instead of this obscure mkv shit!
,xghoulx,2008-01-07T04:43Z,MKV is the future! it's the best thing thats happend to video files since DivX... you can have ONE file that has multi audio tracks and 5+ different sub files etc. you can even make patches to fix audio syncs etc for mkv's... there is standalone players coming out that support mkv and h264 so chill out... untill then build a damn media center... you get a DVI to HDMI cable and DONE...
,Tech-Noir,2008-01-24T05:45Z,"Just a simple question I have:

This file is about 3 GBs in size, contains 720p material aswell as extra audiotracks.


This torrent of Pitch Black: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3698458/Pitch.Black.2000.DVD5.720p.HDDVD.x264-PPQ

is 4.4 GBs and contains the movie only, also 720p.


Is the difference in size only due to the quality of the encoding (just like Xvid etc at different bit rates), and if so, is the difference big between this movie and the one linked above, quality-wise?

I suppose I sort of just have this idea that 720 HD x.264 always is artifact free, or perfect. Obviously that isn't the case, but I also don't know how it scales (what difference there is with having the same movie in 3GB or 4.4GB sizes and the same resolution, does that equal a 1.5 time improvement for the 4.4 one compared to the 3GB one?.

With Xvid you often see lower sizes come with lower resolutions to compensate for the lower bitrates (so as not to have huge blocks and artifacts), but with these 2 examples both being 720p, won't there be a significant difference in bitrates, and how does that translate quality-wise?


Long question I know, but if anyone has the info and some time on their hands, feel free to enlighten me. :)"
,sdgrenavy,2008-01-27T07:25Z,".MKV is a good format for all of the reasons listed above.

Movie Player Classic by the makers of the K-LITE codec pack, will play .MKV movies.

If you wish to convert, this is the best I've found:

Albeit a little slow, it works fine.

,loyal2thebay,2008-03-10T23:27Z,"i didnt read you whole question but, mkv is much smaller than blue ray and hddvd but the quality is amazing, it all depends on how well the video was encoded.  

killawife:
  Convert this to xvid if you want but normal DVD CANT GO LARGER RESOLUTION THAN 700x480 or something small like that.  this video is ""1280 x 544"" it wont go on a dvd idoit!

spherehead:
ps. mkv rules u ungratefull idoit. go back to vhs"
,neveropen,2008-09-20T18:21Z,"Thanks for the x264 and mkv!

To the uploaders, please don't listen to all the luddites who complain for the return of the obsolete avi's.

,Lashmush,2009-06-09T11:15Z,"SphereHead: MKV is VERY much used these days.

anyway, if youre having trouble playing it, download the latest FFDSHOW codec pack, which will allow even Windows Media Player to run ""obscure formats"". However, I recommend using Media Player Classic for this, or if you dont want the codec pack at all, get VLC media player at videolan.org"
