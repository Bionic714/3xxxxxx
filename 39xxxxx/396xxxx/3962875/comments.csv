,SpatatGermhorn,2008-10-13T12:18Z,"nice one rottis :) thankyou for sharing all these

but none of scratch's work with the dub syndicate in your collection?..maybe you forgot ?

'time boom x de devil dead' is legendary,way ahead of its time + one of the best albums to come out of the 80's ..you'll love it if you dont have it already"
,SpatatGermhorn,2008-10-14T04:32Z,"I dont know if you knew already? theres quite a few bogus scratch albums in the collection,but some of them are still worth a listen anyway,even if theyre not LSP :)

some of them are explained a bit on this yank fan site:
