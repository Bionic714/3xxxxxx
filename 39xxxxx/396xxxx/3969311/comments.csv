[T],codres,2008-01-10T09:26Z,Kleska thanks for this! Is there any chance to put the untouched DVD9? I wanna encode them to xvid...Thanks in advance!
,kleska,2008-01-11T10:13Z,"Hi :] well thanks for the comments... codres since you were asking me... well, i don't think it be possible to upload the DVD9, already it's quite boring to upload ""only"" 7,65 GB... lol. sorry."
,andersdahl,2008-01-11T14:36Z,looking for a cover to yhese discs. Could you possibly be so kind and upload a scan. Thank you very much
,kleska,2008-01-11T16:16Z,"Okay andersdahl, it's done. I must add something (which I forgot to write in the description, concerning the cover), to know that - of course - I could not avoid the folding marks ; plus that - you can't see it on the scanned picture but - the cover presents silver reflects (on the letters and other details). I hope you'll enjoy it all the same :)"
,Hicks,2008-01-13T17:15Z,"Hehe, and I tought I would have to upload volume three also after uploading volume two and on the frontlines. :D
Good thing I waited on buying volume three. :)
This is upload is very, very appreciated, kleska.
Just keep on seeding. ;)"
,MatteSwe,2008-01-15T15:13Z,"Is this torrent abandoned now? What's the point with uploading torrents, without intention to fulfill the upload?
Please kleska, just seed until it's done and then you can drop it."
,kleska,2008-01-17T19:57Z,"hey it's okay there's 53 seeds right now, the upload finished today... you know, my mother (yeah, i'm still living at my parents) stops the connection when she assesses i'm taking too much bandwith... so i'm limiting the upload bandwith and the upload is a bit slow... but it's over now ! so i hope you'll enjoy :)"
,kleska,2008-01-19T20:44Z,"Hey everybody I realised there had trouble with few videos on the DVD... I don't know whether it's normal or not since it happens at the very same moments on the physical DVD (by example on drip drippy donald or at the beginning of clown of the jungle) and there's not any scratch on the DVD since it's brand new. So... if someone had the DVD, may he tell if he has the same trouble with his/her own one ? thanks in advance"
,Hicks,2008-01-20T16:26Z,"@kleska

Yes, the short ""clown of the jungle"" has a little skip in the beginning, if that's what you mean. Doesn't bother much, though. 
Anyway, what did you use for shrinking? I'm just wondering why both .iso images are about 3,7 GB, which is way smaller than 4,3 GB, which is what fits on a DVD-R... Quality isn't the greatest because of this I think. I can see blocking artifacts in many videos. Luckily I can get rid most of the artifacts with the ffdshow filters.
In the future, I recommend Nero Recode for shrinking, it's easy to use and does a much better job than dvdshrink."
,kleska,2008-01-20T17:46Z,"yeah maybe but nero is expensive (a) lol. I use a software called ""dvd shrink"", but i'll try to keep in mind your advice for the future."
,MrGoodbar,2008-02-03T22:57Z,"I'm still looking for Chronological donald Volume 2, disc 1. If anyone has it, please seed!"
,younso,2008-07-27T00:37Z,Please seed the cover!
,cutte54,2009-01-10T07:20Z,*Hicks* Would you please reseed Disney on the frontlines disc 2. The torrent seems to be dead and we are many who wants to get it. Thank you very much in advance!
,kleska,2009-02-02T05:18Z,"Well actually I didn't released Disney on the frontlines disc 2 nor Chronological Donald 2, so... if that's to me that you are asking them, you're talking to the wrong person."
