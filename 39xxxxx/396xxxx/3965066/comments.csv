,ask412,2008-02-08T06:33Z,"A remake of the German film 'Mostly Martha' 
The original is a 2001 German romantic comedy drama about a skilled chef in Hamburg, Germany. When her sister dies, she is left taking care of her niece, who gives her problems. She then has to face choices about the best solution to solve the problems set forth by her niece.

The original is more convincing, and enjoyable."

,darklemming,2008-02-16T04:25Z,"Who the fuck is the FXG team?

I know they have been putting up torrents and stuff for a while, but do we know who they are?

I don't. Identify yourselves or be skull fucked!

FXG could be anti-p2p, I don't know but it never hurts to be cautious.

P2P sites have been infiltrated before, and it can happen again. You have been warned."
,patchiethepirate,2008-02-18T02:42Z,very nice quality
,castrology,2008-02-19T08:08Z,STFU darklemming.  You vag.
,stylishirish,2008-03-09T01:50Z,"@ MANDO67 - there is a program called 'DVDflick' that works fairly well, with some nice options - easy to use. you just load the AVI files into the 'project' (you can burn more than one to a DVD - the more files/size etc, the lower the quality obviously, but 2-3 movies per DVD works fine for watching on a player)

@DARKLEMMING - shut your ignorant idiotic outlet of donkey crap that gushes from your keyboard and go join moviex you fucking shithead imbicile dongface

thx to fxg for the best torrents as always"
