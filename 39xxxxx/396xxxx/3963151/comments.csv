,tombokser,2008-01-06T23:30Z,Is it trial version? Or is it the real thing?
[T],castortroy4693,2008-01-07T04:07Z,"Well, the installer is the trial.  But included in the archive are cracked .exe files that you have to copy over the original exe files.  Then it works

The directions should be in the archive.  It's just a simple install, then copy the cracked exe files to the correct folders.

I use this program all the time, and it works great!"
,stampeed,2008-01-10T14:05Z,"hi 
   i downloaded the software and copied the cracks. but when i try to run the avs converter it starts first but then it says video codecs not found and after that its says video converter has stopped working. just to let you know that i have windows vista. 
plz help"
[T],castortroy4693,2008-02-03T19:25Z,"This version of AVS doesn't work well with Vista.  It will do all video / audio formats, with the exception of WMV / WMA. 

Media Player 11, that comes preinstalled in Vista, uses different files than previous versions of Media Player.

I did a lot of searching, and realized that there is no way to get this version to work with Vista using WMV and WMA formats."

,President_Kush,2009-06-22T13:03Z,"castortroy4693 , you said that this version don't work with WMV/WMA files when running vista cuz vista comes preinstalled with media player 11...I asume you're talkin bout WINDOWS media player???.... so is the issue with vista itslef of media player 11?  Cuz i'm running XP with SP3, but I still have Windows media player 11, so will I have the same issues as the vista users?"
,Pongo509,2009-07-08T21:39Z,"Hey castortroy4693 ;

I realize that there are some out there that are unwilling to contribute and yet feel that their selfish comments are welcome.
