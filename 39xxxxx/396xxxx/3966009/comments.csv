,thelillards,2008-01-08T13:50Z,"I am new to the uploading thing. Always been a ""leecher"". haha. Leave feedback to help me along. If it works let me know. This is a .rar file. It was the easiest way to keep it all together for me. I will NEVER enclose a virus or trojan. Not that stupid. And I have a life."
