Beethoven, America s lovable St. Bernard, is in his biggest doggone collection ever. From his beginnings as a puppy on the run from dognappers to his travels across America, this collection features all five hilarious adventures. When the Newtons first bring home a tiny St. Bernard puppy, they would have never guessed how much his larger-than-life personality would change their lives forever. Each film features Beethoven s drooling, disaster-prone antics, but he always finds a way to save the day in the end!
Follow Beethoven as he wins the hearts of Charles Grodin, Judge Reinhold, Kathy Griffin, John Larroquette, Bonnie Hunt and a host of others in these fun-filled classics.
