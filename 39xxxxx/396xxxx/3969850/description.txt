The One Eyed Dude 

  is back with

...:: Fallen Lords... Condemnation >request< -.direct.play.- ::...


:.ripped .:
nothing , nada, nix...



:. about .:
Fallen Lords is set in the Land of Dead, where three armies:Angels, 
Demons & Dead Souls are eternally fighting for supremacy.

The game is like the movie "Gladiator" but with the camera on your 
shoulders, an action game in which you take part of huge battles with
hundreds of warriors while you give orders, cast magic spells, ride 
vehicles, etc.

:. features .:

- Fighting: hundreds of weapons, 12 unique warriors, Tekken-style 
combo system 
- Magic: +30 spells, 3 different magic schools 
- Troop commandment: you can quickly give orders to any unit on
the map in order
to do a frontal attack, a side ambush, protect you, ride a vehicles,
change formations
- 6 Light & Heavy Vehicles: from a fast ride-able Shai to a slow but 
lethal Wyvern skeleton.

In Single Player mode, you can select which army you want to
command and take to the final victory. 
The story for each side is chronologically simultaneous, and so
re-playing the campaign with a different army will show us a 
new perspective over the same conflict.

In LAN/Online Multi-player mode you can play any of the three
modes available...
- Arena: where you use a unique character and try to beat all 
enemies in a close combat.
- Battle Mode: where you can replay the most important battles 
of Fallen Lords Universe
against a "friend". 
- Conquest Mode: where you can set up your own army and try 
to conquest and hold 
a central node.

What's shocking on multiplayer modes is that, even if you are 
only 2 friends in a game, there are hundreds of units moving around,
fighting and obeying your orders.

S p e c i a l   I n f o   N o t e :

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of a packed exe 

( FaLoCo-launcher.exe )

as a lame virus, (coz its the byte by byte check error of em!.) 

Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics

you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!.

(heuristics).    >>>  thank you for reading!.

and remember...
TO REQUEST A GAME YOU NEED TO PM ME ON CERTAIN FORUMS! (dammit)
