,Doggie24690,2008-01-14T20:40Z,It's saying invalid torrent file. O_O... why?
,fatallylost,2008-03-21T03:40Z,"Although most know, you should mention this is far from a complete discog. These are only the full length albums, one EP, and I'm assuming the Believe in What You Want is the DVD rip, or summit."
[V],Askeen,2008-03-28T22:53Z,I dont have the dvdrip :/
,runs111,2008-04-02T16:48Z,thanks!!!
,Amun83,2008-05-08T09:56Z,"Thanks man. I noticed that the song ""Your House"" On the Bleed American Album is not the right version."
,Scormio,2008-07-05T05:35Z,"good songs, but the tags are kind of horrible.

i have like 5 different songs titled ""bleed american"" and another 3 are ""the authority song"""
,DeFt7,2008-10-16T03:15Z,I agree some of the cd's are not even complete not to mention you have like 3 versions of the sweetness and not even the real one. you suck.
,dyrtymynd55,2008-10-29T07:31Z,ID3 tags FTL
,caboose1135,2008-11-21T05:32Z,anyone know here where i can get the believe in what you want dvd? cant find it anywhere..
