There are two sources for this 12 November 1979 show at Jaap Edenhal, Amsterdam - an audience recording, and a radio broadcast.  The whole show is in the hands of two or three collectors who so far haven't shared it.  But, apart from three tracks (Live Wire, Rocker & Let there be Rock) most of the show is available, following a recent Dutch radio broadcast ("Legendarisch Live" on 11 May 2007).  I have sequed in "Live Wire" from the audience-sourced version (quite good except for some variation in the treble and a little flat overall) along with the nine available (and excellent-sounding) soundboard tracks, for the best and most complete version thus far available.
