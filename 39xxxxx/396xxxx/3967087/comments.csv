,masha2006,2008-04-22T09:08Z,"Has anybody managed to play this StarForce-protected DVD9 using Daemon Tools? The protection of this DVD detects that ""emulation software is used"". So, only Postal 1 works for me. Posal 2 demands the real disk. HELP, please! (I have no possibility to write the image to DVD9.)"

find the file with the strange (""?????????"") name and rename it to an English one, then try to extract (probably its in russian and you PC doesnt have a russian UI), should work."
