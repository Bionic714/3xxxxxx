,nexia,2008-01-08T00:02Z,"ok, so you did not have the brilliance to use a mac and make an image of your original cd, isn't it?!

PC users... always in trouble..."
,pen0r,2008-01-08T01:48Z,"well nexia, I actually did make a copy of my original cd on a Mac, that was the DMG file. This ISO version is just a token to all those hopeless PC users who dont seem to find the answer on how to create a bootable CD off a Mac generated image file on a Windows PC, thats it. If you're lookin for a Mac image of this particular version, then look on the other 5 torrents you'll be able to find here of that macOS, theyre all mac images and work like a charm.
good luck."
,antamony,2008-01-08T13:45Z,"Well pen0r, it doesn't matter what you make the cd with, it still isn't going to boot on a PC.

More importantly, ThePirateBay has separate sections for Apps and games, if you aren't able to get the torrent in the right section, you likely aren't going to do well making the ISO either.

You may have just brought the definition of ""hopeless PC user"" to a new low.
Good luck"
,captcornflakes,2008-01-08T21:37Z,"pen0r, you silly person..."
,scottyarch,2008-01-09T01:38Z,"You should try burning in Disk Utility as it can create bootable CDs. Just a thought. Also, you can try Toast Titanium if you want to stay on a Mac.

Also, it wasn't mentioned so I thought I should: This will not run on any Intel Mac. OS9 is not supported on any Intel Mac so if you want to run it you'll have to do so via virtualisation. If you're virtualising on a Mac you don't need to burn this just use the disk image to install with."
,Jerk990,2008-01-09T04:43Z,"Exactly what i needed thanks, pen0r"
,pen0r,2008-01-09T19:13Z,"well antamony, we all humans know for a fact that a MAC cd will not simply boot an a PC at all, this particular ISO file was created on a MAC so that PC users could simply load it on UltraISO (on their pcs of course) then Burn a CD that they could ""Load and Boot On a MAC"" so they could easily update, install or do anything they need to do with it. Reading and understanding is what its all about, using some Logic wouldnt hurt that one either. As for the ""section, apps, game"" thing, just remember ""It's not WHERE you look for it, it's how GOOD, Wisely and Patiently you look for it"". So antamony, If YOU found this torrent, then i could assure you the rest of the ""hopeless PC users"" would find it too regardless of section or category (do you know how to search for exact words?).
For the ones who found some benefit on this one, you're all welcome.
Good Luck."
,pen0r,2008-01-09T19:53Z,"Scottyarch, I tried Disk Utility a few mins ago and to my surprise it did gave me an ISO file which loaded on UltraISO with no problems at all, after i burned the CD and load it on my G5 it would NOT run the the installation automaticly, you will have to double click the setup.exe to start it. I did a research and found out that 2nd party image progs (like Disk-utility) wont keep the pre-arranged scheme of order (meaning that the selected boot file, in this case 'setup.exe', will lose its title as the BOOT file on the transfer process from DMG to ISO) on some cd-roms including OS roms. For this ISO I used HDiUtil which is a native prog on MacOSX. Havent tried Toast Titanium yet, and for the INTEL MacOSX's, YES it's true, you cant downgrade an intel based mac to 9.2 at all, but you can run 9.2 on a virtual drive from the CD itself. 
Good luck everyone."
,frankev,2008-01-12T18:45Z,"Silly me, thinking, this is not a game"
,philznow,2008-02-25T22:30Z,cant get to boot tryed on my g4 just shows floppy disk image with a questionmark
,ViDER,2008-03-21T23:10Z,"pen0r : Thanks for the upload!

To all the smarty pants out there:
What if you own an apple ibook/macbook.. and you don't have a CD burn in it? 
*Me cross fingers for it to work """
,Beatjuggler,2008-04-26T17:17Z,Do not download: no bootable image... its sucks
,snoopfroggyfrog,2008-05-09T00:59Z,"This isn't bootable, it's not even installable. Runs into errors on installation. Don't waste bandwidth on this.

""This was a DMG image converted to ISO on a MacPro, then burned on a CD on Windows XP SP2 using UltraISO."" Oh wow suuupercrack.... f+++U"
,VileCore,2008-06-15T01:57Z,"Pen0r, I believe you missed antimony's point. 
Let me try and explain to you MY understanding 
of what he meant to convey to you:

FUCK PC's! THIS IS A GAMES SECTION FOR MAC USERS! FUCK OFF!"
,tammie12,2008-07-17T03:24Z,"Hi penOr,
Could you please post or could someone post how to actually burn this to CD using UltaIso. I have followed the direction so far and created a .bif file now what do I do?

Thanks so much"
,nickje1,2008-12-30T21:07Z,"VileCore: This is not a games section for Macs, its an application section.... Be thankful he's sharing the fucking files! Also, mac IS a pc you stupid pretentious fuck."
,Dilberito,2009-01-19T21:03Z,"Downloaded quickly and burned to a CD. Will NOT work. Does not work on a Mac, at least."
,cool2090,2010-01-24T07:18Z,"okay so i see how people are thinking that ""MAC"" os runs on pc only modded mac os X intel os x86 run on pc but mac os 9 is macs so if you think mac os 9 works on a pc then leave right now because you are suffering from a serious disease 

together we can find a cure"
,cool2090,2010-01-24T07:20Z,also g5 macs aren't capable of running mac os 9 by it's self it has to be run under classic you can't boot into mac os 9 on a powermac g5 it's just to new of a computer
,AJH1993,2010-11-01T01:38Z,"Thanks for making me waste a CD ON THIS NON BOOTABLE TORRENT.
FUCK YOU"
,t85,2011-04-28T22:00Z,Thanks! I got os9 runnin under vpc 2007 now.
,mirageofmystery,2012-01-29T10:25Z,"Hey I want to thank you for uploading this and also to the seeders keeping it alive.  I really need to figure out what is wrong with an iMac i'm being given to fix up.  If this disc image works, I'll be very happy and will let you know if it's good!"
