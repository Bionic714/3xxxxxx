    this is an amazing album. a masterpiece. somehow chapterhouse manages to pull off rock driven dance songs with electronic melodies that fit into the music so well they become a part of the music and don't stick out like a sore thumb. the vocals are very smooth and melodic and fit the music excellently.

    this album, however, get little to no praise because it is an upbeat electro/rock album in a downtempo shoegazing/dream rock world, which is really a shame. more people should give this album a chance.
