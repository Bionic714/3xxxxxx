Sound isn't perfect but who cares!!
A - 7
V - 9"
,writeniceletters,2008-01-16T19:24Z,i downloaded this and it doesn't have sound...
,mikepua75,2008-01-17T01:49Z,"Glad this finally surfaced. Thanks for posting.

Sound works fine for me. writeniceletters, maybe try downloading the latest version of Windows Media Player....at least that worked for me. Maybe the player you are using doesn't support AC3. Something worth checking into.

I found the quality to be fine. Good video, but I agree with allyk2000 ""Sound isn't perfect but who cares!!"" The sound isn't bad, just not high quality. 

Movie is great. Very visually pleasing and a great connection to the words of the Beatles songs. Movie is a must for any fan of the Beatles. Of course this is an opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. We all have different taste.

,dirtdevil,2008-01-17T16:50Z,it says the video is a DIVX format... maybe using Divx player would make the sound better?? hmmmm? im dling now so ill found out in a while
,spazcataz,2008-01-20T04:15Z,"no u dont because it is in .avi format

,uername88,2008-01-21T06:56Z,"EXCELLENT MOVIE. A 'MUSICAL' WITH BEATLES' MUSIC ENTIRELY THROUGHOUT. EXCELLENT ARRANGEMENTS, HARMONIES...STORY IS GOOD. NEW AND REFRESHING MOVIE. MAY BE FOR MORE MATURE AUDIENCE SUCH AS COLLEGE GRADS; PROFESSIONALS."

,Drew-El,2008-02-06T02:51Z,Anyone know if there is a NhANC3 torrent version of this movie yet? 
,beatlesfan1981,2008-02-08T23:37Z,no sound
,EmoxChick910,2008-02-12T13:35Z,So adorable! Thankies! xoxoxo
,snowpig,2008-02-14T14:40Z,as its a musical.. and all about sound.. i reckon its worth finding a torrent with better sound quality. i found it hard to enjoy the music distorted like that.
,friktioner,2008-02-16T14:25Z,any english subtitle for this yet?
,munkchip,2008-02-22T22:16Z,thank you
