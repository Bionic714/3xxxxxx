Also, is the text burned in, or is it supplied as separate files?"

,billieke3,2008-02-12T01:32Z,"i hope there will be enough seeders to finish this huge file ?
For the rest thank you great serie.
No dutch subs available anyone?"
,annorlunda45,2008-02-14T01:21Z,"@billieke3 dont think it will be easy for you to find any dutch subtitles but I have found english ones for all seasons at

,vejviseren,2008-08-17T17:31Z,Insnt there any subs on this torrent 
,RTRTRTRTRTRT,2008-08-24T05:48Z,does this have the dual audio tracks - one without laughter track? DVD Box set has this - it's much better without the laughter.
,hatman7,2008-09-17T21:55Z,i got the first episode of season 9 why is it not in English??

,diesiltork,2008-12-14T07:23Z,too all how try read carefully  this fucken thing is in Russian   fuck fuck fuck  i have wasted well over a month to get and it has some asshole translating over every thing      not in English    i should have read it better but in my own stupidity i thought something made in god dame English wouldn't be fucked over and ruined but i am sure glad i downloaded 87 gigs of complete shit 
,niki_d,2008-12-14T08:45Z,"@diestiltork:  use vlc to open the file,right clik on screen and then go to audio and select track 2,will work without the sh.....ty russian sub;)"
,rc71,2008-12-14T11:47Z,Thanks for the upload. 
,rc71,2008-12-14T11:48Z,"I Love the complaints about too big or russian. lol.  It says everything right in the description, but I guess people would rather bitch than read."
,ahuizi,2009-05-06T05:33Z,"To summarize... this is a great piece of work.
With the above comments from pixels303 on how to end up with only Eng. sound and, if you want them, annorlunda45 link to subtitles you will end up with a fine set of file so long as you have some basic knowledge of how to manipulate these things. I then used convertxtodvd and now have player ready discs."
,mikey1999,2009-06-12T06:45Z,86.91 gib for the whole series wow i would be better to buy the shows.
,ediger03,2009-11-04T06:00Z,"I know how to switch to just the English when I'm watching it on the computer, but I'd like to burn them to DVD.  Is there a way to burn just the English or to do like real DVDs and in the menu have a selection to get just the English?"
,moehunter,2010-04-18T00:26Z,"Before burning to disc, re-author using dvd shrink or somthing like, deleate the Russ leaving the Eng."
,KOBKED-X,2010-05-19T03:05Z,Thank YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,moehunter,2010-05-28T02:00Z,"Another way to go is with a Media Player which plays most files on your big screen, inc HD Amazing!!!"
,voldini,2010-05-28T10:25Z,"Please seed, stuck at 97%.
tx for the upload."
,Pretorian123,2010-07-02T03:04Z,Pls SEED
,Elliott22x,2010-08-29T17:47Z,"Is there anyway to convert this video and keep only the English audio? I'm using Xilisoft, but I do not see any option for the dual audio tracks???"
,Bigjake52,2010-12-14T23:04Z,"What kind of porgram do I need to rip the russian out of the files, "
,RDSEAL,2011-03-25T12:49Z,"Great Upload BabySG!!!
