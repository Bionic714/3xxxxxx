Recorded and mixed in two marathon 8 hour sessions with engineer Jason Macierowski, "A Collection of Songs..." revisits the mammoth crescendos and washed out space guitar of their previous release and expands them, taking tense quiet melodies and then throwing them at a brick wall of guitar shrapnel and shattered drum sticks. For fans of Built to Spill, Shellac, the Who, Hum, Mogwai, etc.
