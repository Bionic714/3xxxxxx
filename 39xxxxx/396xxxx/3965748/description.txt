Plot Outline: 
Leo and Darren are two gay roommates living in London, each single and pursuing romantic 
happiness. While Darren strikes up a relationship with real estate agent and sex-friend Jeremy, 
Leo after many failed relationships is disconsolate about having any social life so joins 
a New Age men\\\\\\\'s therapy group. In the group session, he comes clean about his feelings for 
another group member (James Purefoy) which leads to a homosexual affair. Then the situation is 
complicated by the re-union with his original high school sweetheart (Jennifer Ehle) and the 
whole thing transcends into sexual ambiguity. 

Reviews: 
This is a thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted film. It is funny and sometimes hilarious. The finale 
is a bit disappointing, since it tries to wrap everything up into too neat a package. The film 
is better remembered for its priceless vignettes: the Jane Austen staging, the camping trip as 
examples. B & H does not attempt to mirror the predominant attitudes toward homosexuality and 
bisexuality. Most of the characters are quite accepting of sexual diversity. In that sense it is 
a joyous vacation from homophobic society. And it is a celebration of a flexibility, a loosening 
of rigid sexual categories--perhaps a happy harbinger of things to come.
