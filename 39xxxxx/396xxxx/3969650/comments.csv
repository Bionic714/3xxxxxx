,Everdrah,2008-01-13T16:00Z,"So, where are the LOD disc located eh? I only see disc images for Diablo 2 (cd 1, 2, 3) 

And when I try to install, it ask for play disc. =/"
,breinholtz1337,2008-02-03T02:26Z,"i cant make this work, it just say ""put in playdisc and i've run the patches and tried every disc there is, did i miss anything ?"

Wtf?!"
,avenged_7x,2008-02-16T22:38Z,"ok for all those who are having problems:
     / go to the directory where the original files where installed.   ( go to My Comp, then the Hard Drive, then program files, then diablo 2.
    / after you get there replace the cracked version of the file with the original Diablo2.exe
    / this will force the game to open the cracked version instead of the original 

I hope this helps you all"
,avenged_7x,2008-02-16T22:42Z,"oh and let me know if that worked

,MagicalJoe,2008-03-21T00:28Z,"Lost your legit LOD cdkey??

Okay guys I did some work for Blizzard North back in the day and I know how their serial system works. With that.. I also know its flaws.
In beta testing for LOD the test team I was on was having huge problems with our keys being recognized by bnet so what the developers of the online portion did was link the D2 classic cd key to the LOD key when it was entered on bnet for debugging purposes, they also made an automated email service where you send in your DII classic cd key in a specific format and it sends you your LOD cdkey that corresponds to your DII classic key.

Okay now on to the business end

I doesn't matter what email you use to send for the key.. as far as I know because my buddies all have hotmail and that worked for them and I used an old aol account and they all worked so I'm just assuming the others (live, yahoo, gmail etc.) work too...

so first off make a new email to:

blizzard.north.battle.net@gmail.com

long story as to how blizzard.north.battle.net went to gmail (used to be blizzard.north.battle.net@bnet1g.com)

with this in the subject field:

%hg_seri%confi_em1

^copy and paste that!! VERY important

then in the main body paste:

%hg_loas/%termin3;6
%lordod*diab_x2%recev
%(your diabloII cdkey here)
%tmit_rsendr% hed1

so it should look something like this:

%hg_loas/%termin3;6
%lordod*diab_x2%recev
%6PNPD7P1HZ8MPZNP
%tmit_rsendr% hed1

REMEMBER!! do NOT but dashes in the cdkey! the program cannot read the key with dashes in it!!

usually it comes back within 2 minutes but it took one of the guys in my team 2 days as I recall.

it will come back with both your DII key and your LOD key It could have my name in it somewheres because that's my personal code for the return loop.. anyways have fun and do it quick because if they see that ""I'm"" trying to get my lod key 350 times in a couple days it will get shut down so hurry!!"
,INSANE_ORACLE,2008-03-21T19:36Z,"this diablo 2 worked for me

i copied the 3 iso files

+ the diablo 2 lod image too its located thesame folder

then i used power iso to mount the image


i installed the game ""full install""

then i installed the ""official 1.11b patch""

then i go to www.gameburnworld.com and download the no cd crack for lod

follow the steps then 

im finished"

..and no, you can't play on standard battlenet with this, or any other ripped Blizzard game, no matter what 'magical' solution they may have.  Their security is too tight.  
Got an original cd key?  Perfect. Keep it.  Don't give em out, or its your ass.
Google a 'hamachi' private server if you wanna play with others."

,twobitsprite,2008-07-07T00:51Z,"The person who uploaded this is an idiot. Not only did they extract the various zips and include both the zip and extracted files in the torrent (??), they also did not include any instructions.

I installed from CD and tried to patch with the noCD crack but it says ""unknown version"", but when I try to patch with the 1.11 update, it asks for the CD... (which of course it doesn't find even if you burned it or have it mounted on Daemon tools). And what is the ""Tunman_Mod""?

Its a shame that this is the most seeded torrent for D2, because its crap!"
,Mickross,2008-07-07T10:20Z,"Ok im no pro but i got the Diablo 2 to install and work. Ill be using my own LoD cd and key so i will just explain the original D2.

Before you start make sure you have PowerISO. Try to download it with a serial key to otherwise you can use the one i downloaded.
NAME: TEAM EXPLOSiON
SERIAL : GLZYY-983YI-IE5U8-EWFKX-3IQYZ

Now there is a lot of not nessesary shit on this torrent im afriad that made me real confuse so i try to explain as simple as possible.

Step 1: In the Diablo_II map you have the three CD files with the names  Diablo_CD1, Diablo_CD2 and Diablo_CD3. These three files should be the image of a yellow disk. If not reinstall powerISO.
Extract These into 3 maps. (Just right click and extract with powerISO)

Step2: Dubbleklick on the Diablo_CD1 and the PowerISO window will appear.
In the top middle you have a Mount button, ( eller ''Montera'' på svenska) Click on the arrow on the button and the option bar will appear.  Then press ''Mount image to Unit E'' ( Montera avbildning till Enhet [E:] )

Step3: After that you go in the Diablo_CD1 map you created and Dubbleclick on the install file. (The Install window will appear and you choose what kind of install you want to do, Full, Multiplayer or Singerplayer.)

Step 4 When started the install the it will ask for the ''Play Disk'' Simply dubbleclick on the Diablo_CD2 file and mount it. (The yellow disk one) 
The install will then ask for the ''Cinematics disk'' and you mount the Diablo_CD3 to Unit E.(or whatever your diskreader name is.)
The install will then ask for the Install disk one more time and then you are done. (Disk 1)

Step5: Instead of using the crack that im not sure exacly how to use. (Said im no pro) I just mount the CD2 to Unit E before i start the game. 

I hope i got your somewhere, If you have the 'Diablo dosent start up prob'' you have to ask someone els ^^. Try Installing the LOD it may work. It may not :)

By and sry for my porr english."
,Mickross,2008-07-07T13:01Z,"Oh and btw, for those who dont find the expansion CD. Its the d2e file in the first map.

You wont be abel to play on Battle.net with any CDkey generade im afraid. Even if you have your own LoD cd key.
If you just want to play with friends you know you go in ''other multiplayer'' and just create a TCP/IP game. (Its very easy)"
