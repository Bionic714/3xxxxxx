rofl DA ZE
thank you for this awesome torrent
any chances for brood wars ?

and, for that matter, any way to install patches ?
tried installing patches standard but they exit with errors ( for not finding files )
fiddled with registry and files .. the closes i got was by copying stardat.mpq to a broodwars install ..text is all messed up ( damn UTF-16 i guess ) but i get japanese sounds on units .. and that is where the fun is @
thanks again for this great torrent"
,qdaruma,2008-01-08T10:26Z,"Thank You for this!!!
Ive been waiting for this for a while, but it seems that nothing (PcGame) comes out of Japan, or its just lame me who cant get it..
Could You upload Broodwar in JP also, Please?
Or other games that came out in japanese, but of origin western.
Thanks in advance!"

They ended up sending new copies of Normal SC to all the people that bought SC Japan, but still allow the game to be played on Battle.net but chatting is restricted to Open Tech Support and Starcraft Japan USA-1 or the like channel."
,qdaruma,2008-01-09T21:54Z,"Strange. But Japan, hey ;)
Thanks for the info!
You know other western games released in japanese, strategy or half-life for example. Or they release them as is, in english?"
,qdaruma,2008-01-10T10:52Z,"The nocd isnt working for me... At least not in japanese... Its working in english unicode, but with hyeroglyphs... 
Ive tried to set unicode to japanese, but not working... it uses cpu at 99%, but wont start. Same with ms applocale...
Any suggestions?
Thanks"
,qdaruma,2008-01-10T11:22Z,"Hopefully someone reads this... The ""normal"", no-nocd version neither works... It sais it needs a file and it cant find it on the cd.... Ive mounted it, so.."
,pra,2008-02-21T14:24Z,"is this a full japanese translation of starcraft, i.e. with unit sounds, too? i'm kinda collecting unit sounds in different languages^^
I do not care about working nocd or not, i should be able to extract the sounds"
,pra,2008-04-13T15:43Z,"this is real japanese, thanks!
is there a broodwar, too?"
