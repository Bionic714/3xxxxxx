This is Starcraft Japan. It is in NRG Format. This game works well on any PC, and works using normal standard starcraft keys. This will only connect to USWest unless you edit your hosts file to match:

63.240.202.139 exodus.battle.net

Or switch the IP with whatever server you want to play on.

You will also need the NoCD Loader. This can be found here: http://realityripple.com/files/?file=JNC

Enjoy ^_^
