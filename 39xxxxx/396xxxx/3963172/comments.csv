,NINgod,2008-01-28T05:02Z,what an disrespectful ass. why did you get rid of the credits? if your going to steal a movie you may as well give some credit to the people who made it.

I finished seeding a while ago, but I want you to know that I am still enjoying this file quite a bit and the movie is infinitely better at 720p quality. thanks again"
