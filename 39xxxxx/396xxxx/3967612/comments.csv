Second:  The data rates are 63 and 65.

I realize that a lot of people who like audio books don't mind that the compression rate is so tiny.  I guess I'm different, in that I like a little less compression... at least 92.  That way there are more of the vocal tones of the reader, and the ambient quality is much better... and it doesn't sound so clipped through actual speakers.  (I know... beggers/choosers...)

Does anyone have Born Standing Up: A Comic's Life?

Thanx again..."
