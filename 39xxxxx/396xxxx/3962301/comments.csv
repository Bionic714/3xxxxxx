[T],Omegarex1969,2008-01-06T05:03Z,I created these ringtones in mp3 format for easy of use and portability.  And they are able to be used on the iPhone. 
,hooghlyrocks,2008-01-06T15:25Z,"these ringtones are not iPhone ready...
to make them iPhone ready
1. Add to iTunes
2. Convert them to AAC
3. Copy them to somewhere like the desktop
4. Delete the originals from iTunes
5. Change the file extension to m4r
6. Add them back to iTunes

Please note that ringtones have to be 30 seconds or less."

Can you give the correct specs for aac for the iPohne so I can convert all the ringtones from mp3 to aac. I was going to use Xilisoft Audio Converter to do it and I just want to make sure I do it right."
[T],Omegarex1969,2008-01-12T00:50Z,"I rencoded the ringtones to aac and added the extension m4r s you should now be able to just move these over to your ringtones folder and sync them to your iPhone. I left these ringtones a little long so you can crop the section you like. Leave me a coment telling me if they worked so I can encode the other 200 and post them.
