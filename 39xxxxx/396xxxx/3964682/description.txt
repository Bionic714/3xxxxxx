Lots of very good books in this collection, over 30!

Ranging from basic through to advanced, but none are in English! They are in Spanish, French, Italian, Polish etc.

This includes books from John Yoshi Naka, Peter Chan and many other well known Artists. Any bonsai enthusiast should have an opportunity to have these books on their shelf. 

Bonsai Techniques 1 by John Yoshi Naka is the Bible for Bonsai enthusiasts and many books are just ripoffs of the great book, this is in this collection.

The file is big, but worth the wait.

Enjoy!!!

None in English in this collection sorry! 

If you have anything in English or any other language that is Bonsai related, please share!
