,zephyrb,2008-02-20T16:29Z,"My 2 cents... After testing a few different flavors of XP floating around (Vision,Black,Dark,Tiny,Gamer), this one (Dark .6) seems to be the cleanest without a lot of widget addons that become annoying.

Passed WGA test and win updates, great bootup options, clean interface, etc. Overall, 2 thumbs up!

Anyone else have an opinion on this?"
,topher27,2008-02-29T04:14Z,"Is there any problems with this at all?

Does this require a serial key?

Please reply!!

Thanx. ]P. ][. /v\.]P.][.|\| version hopefully!!"
,farmerb333,2008-03-02T16:33Z,"so does this need a serial? Or is it in the pack already?
"
,farmerb333,2008-03-03T00:07Z,"OK... Wow!!

I downloaded this torrent, and it is by far the best OS I have had yet!

I have tried Vista Ultimate, which worked, but was just so incompatible with everything. I then tried XP pro SP3 - I found it slow and glitchy.

This however is good shit! You get better looks than vista, but with xp stability. Not to mention all the little extras this includes!! Amazing.

To install:

-Download torrent

-Burn image file to disk using nero 8.

-Run the newly burnt disk on any pc in order to create a bootable CD, use the 'full option' version.

-Burn ISO to disk and boot in pc you wish to install xp dark edition on.

- You dont need a serial number and it passes all WGA and updates etc...

-After installing, be sure to go to control panel, regional and language settings, and change to English (UK) (or whatever language you desire!.

An absolutly amazing Torrent. 

THank you very much!!
