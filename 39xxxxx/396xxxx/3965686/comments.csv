Option 1. Team XBMC's shortcut tool.
It's included in the _tools folder as SHORTCUT by TEAM XBMC.xbe + SHORTCUT by TEAM XBMC.cfg.
Instructions here: http://xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=As_a_Dashboard (Option 1).
Rename the SHORTCUT by TEAM XBMC.xbe+.cfg & also EDIT the .cfg so it matches your config.
See APPLICATION INSTALL above.

Option 2. Thanks to an app called Team UIX's Xbe Shortcut Maker v1.0 by JbOnE, it's now easy...
Transfer contents of XBMC folder (this is VERY important since the tool is hardcoded) TO /E:/APPS/XBMC/.
Rename SHORTCUT by TEAM UIX.xbe to something your"
