I myself prefer english subtitles on these films, as the dubbed over english makes it crap!  (my opinion only)"

Mine too, i hate dubbed films.
This is great in it's original language, but this dubbed version sucks monkeyballs!! ;@"
,al3zextend,2008-02-23T13:49Z,does anybody know where to get this movie with original audio? i seek it very long time and no positive results. 
,ewfcxb,2008-05-03T17:35Z,"Cantonese Audio: *Kung.Fu.Hustle.2004.WS.DVDRip.XviD.iNT-EwDp* (1CD)
*Kung Fu Hustle ""ENG SUB""* (1CD) is listed as Japanese audio (???) 
*Kung Fu Hustle 2004 720p BluRay DTS x264-ESiR* (.mkv 4.37GB)
*Kung_fu_Hustle_full_dvd* (6.72GB)
FXG have great rips (one of the few 1CDers that include subs!), but let's face it - dubbed audio sucks"
