First release for Melbourne Instrumental outfit Angler.  Well known for their stunning live performances and amazing atmospheric grooves.  Angler's music is a combination of electronic / loose beats / twangy guitar riffs.  In search of charm is the album that started it all for the four piece band, not sure when it was released, I think it may have been 1998 or 1999.  The following albums were good, but this one is my personal favorite.
