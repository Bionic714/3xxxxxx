For example, songs like Kashmir, Trampled Under Foot and Whole Lotta Love are played in a way which make them more close to the studio versions than any other live versions I have heard.

In My Time Of Dying and Dazed And Confused sound very ""dark"". The main reason for this is that both of them (and several of the other songs) are played in a lower key than their usual keys. I think this has to do with Robert`s voice, as we all know his voice cracked down a bit some 35 years ago!

Some of the songs are also played a bit slower than in the past. But if you ask me, this fact make them sound better!

Folks, let us remember this show for what it is: Some great nostalgia from one of the greatest bands in rock history! It would be almost comical (tragical?) if they would start a tour almost 30 years after they disbanded. They have already been at the top of the musical world and have nothing to prove. Robert is clever enough to understand these facts, Jimmy and Jonesy I donÂ´t really know about... "

,staern,2008-05-02T16:44Z,"Shame, shame, shame on me!!! I think all tunes are played in their ""right"" keys..."
,staern,2008-05-20T20:36Z,"OK people, you can laugh if you want: There ARE in fact some tunes that are ""dropped"" in a lower key!
I have been on this subject four times now, I think that can be enough...maybe some of you other guys can sort this out???"
