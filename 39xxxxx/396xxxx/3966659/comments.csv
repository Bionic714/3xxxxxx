,shanx97,2008-01-08T08:24Z,I would like to add that this is the retail version and it is resumale using download manager like flashget.
,titi2015,2008-01-08T15:51Z,"Hi,

Is it a multi-lang version and does it work with clony crack?"
,culiptist,2008-01-08T17:42Z,"People don't be fooled by this idiot. I did a reverse look up on this kids website that provide the download. The url was ""http://msft-dnl.digitalrivercontent.net."" Then I used this to do a reverse lookup for the IP. Now that I have the ip I checked with ""http://network-tools.com/default.asp?prog=lookup&host=68.105.125.33"" to see who it was registered to. And look what I found! 

68.105.125.33 US UNITED STATES CALIFORNIA EL CAJON COX COMMUNICATIONS INC 

The guy or who ever create the site is uploading files from his computer and claiming that there from a microsoft server. Guess what dude go fuck your self!  Don't download this shit!"
,culiptist,2008-01-08T21:42Z,"I did some more research on this link to microsofts free untouched vista and I provided the links to let you decide whether or not this is worth the risk of downloading. I don't!!

,jizac2,2008-01-14T11:18Z,"culiptist you are the idiot... 

Why don't you learn about wassup around da way before you start flaming peeps

,jizac2,2008-01-14T11:25Z,"Many torrents have the legit links from Digital River for the 3 needed files that you then make the iso with cdimage... as does this torrent form Demonoid way bak when... Bottom line the links are forever active!

""Vista x86 Direct D.L. and Activation Patch By Gkend"" incl Voatk Tools. just made another iso for proof of concept blah, blah, blah"
,culiptist,2008-01-16T06:07Z,"I love how people like to make stupid comments without solid proof to back them up.  Sure the files could work.  I'm not saying that.  But there surely not from ""ms server"" like skanx97 posted.  Not only that I have yet to see that these links are directly link to Digital River.  If they were Microsoft would have so sued the f*** out of this company.  Not only that Digital river does allow you to download the OS, but certainly not for free.  You must go to the www.windowsmarketplace.com and pay first then you will be provided a link to download the OS.  JFYI the link provided for the download is a transparent link which pretty much means that it works like a proxy address....so the link certainly wont work twice.

Not only that Shanx... posted a link to his torrent and bashed mine that's the only reason why I took such an aggressive approach to finding out the truth behind this so called ""direct links from MS SERVER""  Ultimately if your torrent is good people will download it.  Posting/advertise you torrents on other people torrents is quite rude and un pirate like.  "
,shanx97,2008-01-17T08:34Z,cul.... download or else get lost . Do ot post here .
