,p00p3don,2008-01-08T13:22Z,i heard that Turkish has NO irregular verbs....
,sg7346435,2008-02-04T14:37Z,"As a native turkish speaker I listened to this. Was fun. It's the standard Pimsleur daily life & dating vocabulary for any language. Kind of boring to have exactly the same conversations for each language. 
It's allright, but there is one thing, throughout the lessons the word ""affedersiniz"" is beeing used for ""excuse me"". That is allright since it is turkish, but in daily life you(or turkish people) use the French ""Pardon"" waay more often. "
