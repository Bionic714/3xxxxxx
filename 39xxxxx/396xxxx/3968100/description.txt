Another fun New Years Eve with Patti and the band, and a couple of her family members as special guests. Patti makes a crack about this, as she introduces sister Kimberly and sings a bit of Sly Stone's "Family Affair". But it's all good, because she doesn't have to pay 'em and that leaves her more money to buy caviar (this will be explained during the show) :D

Finally, on this night, she brings the show opener Alejandro Escovedo onstage for a few songs, most notably a duet on Bob Dylan's "Dark Eyes". It's still ragged and beautiful, though maybe not as dramatic as the original duets with Dylan on the 1995 tour.

There's a great Video on YouTube of the Patti/Dylan version:

and if you leave a comment, Patti just may read it, as she talks about this after the song.

Anyway, enough already. Please enjoy this audience version. The "other" version is forthcoming as well. This audience recording gives a better idea of how it actually sounded in the Bowery on this night, but if ya just want the radio show, I guess you'll have to wait a day or so.

Thanks to everyone who made this possible, and to Patti & the band for the awesome shows.
Always share this freely- not for profit, and support all these fine musicians. Patti just put out a new album on itunes today, so please do the right thing and BUY it. ;-)

Also, we would appreciate if this is converted to MP3 ONLY for personal use. Not put on someone's fucking website as an MP3 download. I'm talking to YOU, Big O!



Peace, Y'all and Happy New Year!
