Latest release of my rompacks covering release no 1801-1900.

Finally I sat down and renamed my entire collection to cope with the ADVANsCEne releaselist; which is the same as the one that GBAtemp uses, among others.

These roms check out on both NDSCRC and Rominator.

Expect a re-release of 1701-1800 soon to include the three roms, 1798 - Englisch Buddy (EU), 1799 - WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2008 featuring ECW (US), and 1800 - Boku to Sim no Machi - Resort ni Genki o Torimodosou! (JP),
that got lost in the transition.

Donations are always greatly appreciated!

Cheers, puss och kram!
