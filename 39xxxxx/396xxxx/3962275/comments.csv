,Hypnopompia,2008-01-06T19:01Z,What do i need to do to my roms #1-1700 to sync with these new releases?
[T],magumagu,2008-01-06T21:10Z,"The checksums are alright; you need to rename + repack them though (if you want the new numbering for the old roms as well).

Renaming is easiest with clrmame (Google's your friend!) using the releaselist on http://www.advanscene.com/, and then you rename the roms with 7-Zip and the scripts found in the comments of my earlier torrents.

Cheers!

,eiramorrigan,2008-01-08T10:02Z,"I'm not sure if this would be the right pack (it's within the date range of the games), but Tadashii Kakitori-kun: Kondo wa Kanken Taisaku Dayo (http://www.gametrailers.com/game/5875.html#userreviews) seems to be missing. I could be completely wrong because I don't know how the numbering scheme goes, but... Just a heads up if I'm right ^_^ And thanks once again for the awesome pack!"
[T],magumagu,2008-01-08T11:22Z,"All are there. Check the releaselist on: http://www.advanscene.com/

,grr_rotjeknor,2008-01-10T00:12Z,"THX for yet another GREAT pack.

nice to see ya use the ADVANSCENE dat.
it is the most correct one in my book !

if ya use NDScrc instead of CLRMAME,
ya can let it put the original release.nfo
and the screenshots,boxart and icon in the zip too
