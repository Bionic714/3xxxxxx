,GoYanks,2008-01-11T17:34Z,"It is ridiculous that this movie got so much attention. Does no one see that this world is going down in flames. No one should download this movie. Plus the guy who wrote this says he is an athiest, well if athiest dont believe in Christ or the devil then why would he symbolize a child killing God at the end? He does believe and he is just a soul crying out for help. I am praying for all of the lost souls out there. Let God in! He loves you and wants you to enter his kingdom."
