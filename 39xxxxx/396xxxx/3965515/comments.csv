Without  a dts decoder and a 5 channel system you here with every stereo booster white noise - and you can damaged your speakers, great or?!!

DON'T BELIEVE THIS COMMENT !!!

For Thai7777 your getting what sounds like the DTS track being played as an analogue track.  If you play a digital signal via an analogue device you just get noise..millions of square pulses.  

You need to put the same signal via a device that understands this 'noise' and can convert it to multitrack anolouge audio.  In this case a DTS decoder. 

Just write the ISO or image to CD and play that CD in a DVD player or Home cinema system if you want the extra channels.  Standard CD players will not understand DTS unless it has the encoders built in to enterp. 

Good luck.
