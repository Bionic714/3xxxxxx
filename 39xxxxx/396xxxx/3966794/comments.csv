,dark_light,2009-08-16T10:20Z,"Cloning, feel-good drugs, anti-aging programs, and total social control through politics, programming, and media - has Aldous Huxley accurately predicted our twenty-first century existence? With a Storyteller's genius he weaves these ethical controversies in a compelling narrative that draws in the 632 A.F. (After Ford, the deity). This title is read by Michael York."
