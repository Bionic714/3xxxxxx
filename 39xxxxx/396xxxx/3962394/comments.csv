,Steppenwolf1948,2008-12-30T22:53Z,"Hi there, 

Being a great fan of C&C I was delighted to find this torrent. It is still downloading, but when I checked one of the episodes it appears that all files were incomplete, that is, they play allright but only for two minutes or so. What did I do wrong? 

Rolf"

,Cristian1337,2010-01-13T18:15Z,"Thanks man this really brings back memories and
@Steppenwolf1948- Each episodes is like 6 or seven minutes long, the original cow and chicken showed two episodes together. spacewuppy has each individual episode. On wikipedia there's a total of 52, in this torrent there's 104 episodes divide that by 2 and you have 52 =)"
