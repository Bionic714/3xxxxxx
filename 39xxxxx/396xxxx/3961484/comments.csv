,Kenny_rocco,2008-02-05T21:17Z,"This thing doesnt seem to work with my swedish xp pro. I can install step 1-2-3 and when the fourth comes up ""rollup2"" is says ""This can only be installed on a Windows xp pro media center edition""...
Does any one know anything about this? Would like to have it."
,Kopheimboy,2008-02-09T18:37Z,"Step 4 , you dont need to install ....  if you have install 1-2-3 its finish"
,dangerousd2007,2008-02-12T03:26Z,hi guys ive tested this so called update and it prob aint a ms release it intergrates its self with home or pro replacing some windows system files wich causes a problem with sp2 or 3 the security features just restore the old windows files after reboot and it apears nothing has happened the only way round this problem is to intstall in safe mode and click no on any windows unreconised file versions messages
,oddvarr,2008-02-19T23:12Z,"@kenny
I have tested it. It works.
Before you install Rollup2, you have to run windows update untill no more updates are available, then you can install Rollup2. Run update again.
My system says it is 2002 edition, but as far as I know you will have 2005 after installing Rollup2"
,Smilin-Sam,2008-02-25T16:42Z,I have but one question - should we start the installation booting to the ISO (BartsPE rocks!) or just start the install scripts while already logged into our PC's with a user that has admin rights?  I would imagine that the install would require a user with admin privileges since there are system files being modified but I just wanted to make sure...kind regards! 
,Kopheimboy,2008-03-02T14:59Z,"Yes , you most re-boot with the CD in. and then  BartPE ROcks will shows. SO i hope You Anderstand!! 
Media- Center is very fun!!!"
,hintzsche,2008-05-15T12:00Z,Hi i tryed to install this update but it says i have to insert my xp pro cd2 but i have a xp home edition. So it doesnt work with xp home.
,hintzsche,2008-05-15T14:03Z,i have installed Media center now but my windows xp home edition wasnt be updated. So the Mediacenter wont start on windows xp home
,archp2008,2008-05-22T00:05Z,I downloaded and burned this file last night.  I had been planning to update a copy of XP that I have in a dual boot setup on a drive with Vista 64 on the other partition. Can this software work in this kind of setup? 
,naillor,2008-05-23T23:26Z,"I have XP Pro Sp2 installed. Everything ok until i get to Part 2 : install MCE 2005. Asks me for a file called mcdftreg.inf which should be located on CD2 of XP Pro. 

Problem is i only got one CD with XP Pro (dell packaged with computer)and the file aint on it. Any advice "
,archp2008,2008-06-04T03:10Z,It seems that a ton of people are getting the same problem.  It's listed on forums all over the Net. The file you name is not on my XP and it's not on this iso file either. Actually there are no .inf files just .in_  I will try the two steps on a single blank hard drive and let you know if I get the same error. 
,dutch-torrents,2008-06-05T19:27Z,"SEED PLEASE!!

I Really Need This Download!"
,archp2008,2008-06-07T05:17Z,"Like Kenny,  I just get the mesage, ""This can only be installed on a Windows xp pro media center edition.""  Kopheimboy, why do you include a copy of XP pro on the disk when most of us already have a working copy of that operating system?  Can't Media Center 2005 itself be cracked without having to reinstall XP Pro which we alreay have? The only thing I forgot to do was to delay all the XP updates until after attemping the R2 rollback.  I got CRC error after the first reboot on the XP installation so I had to install my own XP pro copy."
,golgappajabba,2008-06-09T19:17Z,"Okay. This should make it easy enough for a trained monkey to install.  If you still dont understand after following my instructions then you should down in a puddle of your own vomit.

There's a few steps you need to follow to make this work. Just follow them to the dot and you'll be fine.

1 - Burn ISO to a CD.  This is important because you'll need to boot from disc anyways. So you may as well burn it now.

2 - Now, pop the disc in and it should autorun. CLose the autorun installer and go to Explorer and explorer the discs contents.

3 - Go to the DOTNET folder and install DOTNET11 (NOT 1.0 as suggested by the installer)

4 - Reboot

5 - Now go back and and INSTALL MCE 05

6 - Reboot.

7 - Go to your PC's BIOS and change boot priority to CD-ROM

8 - Once you start booting from disc, you'll see BartPE starting up. Be patient. This takes a while.  You'll know you're ready when you see a BARTPE screen with a ""GO"" button where your Start button usually is.

9 - Right next to this button, you'll see a little window thats patiently minimized.  Restore/Maximize the window and you'll see a prompt asking you to modify a few registry settings.  To do so, you'll need to press ""Y"".  

10 - Once you do this, you'll be asked to reboot.  DO this, but remember to rstore your boot priority to HDD.

11 - Now you're back to windows.  Autorun the disc installer again and install the pre-rollup updates.  Reboot.

You've now got MCE installed on your PC.  TO check, go to My COmputer->Properties and you should see Windows XP MCE.

Rollup 2 is optional.

Enoy.  And if this helped, say thank you to me. ANd the uploader Kopheimboy.

En Taro Adun."
,naillor,2008-06-17T18:39Z,"Cheers golgappa, for the precise instructions but im still getting the same problem with ""Part 2 : install MCE 2005. Asks me for a file called mcdftreg.inf which should be located on CD2 of XP Pro.

Any body else have the same issue?"
,haaakaaa,2008-06-22T01:00Z,thank you wery much  : D  works fine
,Kopheimboy,2008-06-23T15:10Z,"OK. Thank you : golgappajabba. for the help.

I see many here ho haves problems to instal on  XP Home Edition.  
I tested it on XP Home and it stil works! 
And its works on XP Pro.

Windows XP is the best!!!!"
,golgappajabba,2008-06-24T18:44Z,"@ naillor : I think the way to fix the issue you;re experiencing is to actually browse to the disc itself and go to the cmpnents\i386 folder of MCE.  The file you're looking for is located in the medctr.cab file.

Try that.  I actually had to do this a few times to realize that the file is in the source disc, so you shouldnt really need any XP discs.

Lets us know how it goes then, wont you laddie? :-)"
,naillor,2008-06-26T18:38Z,"golgappajabba,

Eureka, many thanks, got it working after your advice. Youre a star. 

and thanks to kopheimboy for the torrent"
,DrunkPollock,2008-07-05T04:47Z,"followed the instructions to the letter 3 separate times and still doesn't work. 

everything installs and i don't get any errors, but it still says i have xp sp2 installed and media center won't run"
,Bushhater10,2008-07-17T09:34Z,Do you have to burn it to a disk or can you mount the image? 
,Bushhater10,2008-07-17T12:16Z,"ok i have a problem... i installed dot net framework versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.1sp1. installed MCE 05. i set up to do a boot from disk but once it trys to boot it says ""press F1 to to retry boot, Press F2 to go back to setup"" or something like that i have no idea what to do since i cant get to BartPE"
,Bushhater10,2008-07-17T13:17Z,^ ok i fixed it i just made another cd. apparently something happened when i wrote it to the other cd anyway thanks for the torrent Kopheimboy it works very well
,Islandsnow,2008-07-25T21:33Z,"followed instructions, media does not start only thing i got working is the themes"
,OMG MasterChief,2008-08-04T05:32Z,HOW DO YOU GET THIS TO WORK WITH XBOX 360
,golgappajabba,2008-08-06T19:53Z,"@ OMG MasterChief : To use it with the 360 you need to install the Xbox 360 program. Follow the instructions after you've ensured that MCE is set up exactly as described by the good folks above.  To get everything working you'll need to ensure you follow the instructions on your 360 as well.

It's really easy - just follow the prompts and you should be OK."
,MiskyBoyy,2008-08-07T01:08Z,"Just wondering, Can you boot via external Dvd drive because my internal drive is broken...?"
,golgappajabba,2008-08-09T20:58Z,@MiskyBoyy - yeah. I dont see any problems with that.
