,karaken12,2009-09-06T21:22Z,"Great torrent -- great sound and colour, with the full intro and credits for each episode.  The only trouble is, series 2 episodes 5 and 6 (Ricochet and Give Or Take A Million) are missing, with mpeg copies of other episodes there instead.  Other that that this is a fantastic download -- seed for as long as you can!"
,freedomdwarf1,2012-02-05T16:24Z,I have uploaded the complete series - nothing missing.
