,wilco1000,2009-10-04T01:33Z,"Hi madmax999 can you please seed this one?
Regards Wilco"
,madmax999,2010-05-25T17:13Z,"Yes to seeding, i was gone for a while but I have been rotating the seeds for about 3 months now.  Hope you still had it in your download list.

Loved that movie ""Go Tell The Spartans"".  Now i have to get it.  If it is not here already I will post it.  Especially like his explanation of why he was still a colonel."
