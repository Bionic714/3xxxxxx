Hard to find.  I've never even seen it on TV.  Seems to be banned. Not politically correct.  Historically pretty acurate.

Apache Ulzana leaves the reservation to raid. Army sends a troop to capture. Burt Lancaster is the realistic, self honest, scout sent with them.  The naivitie of the young army leutenant is an excellent marker of mental and emotional change to reality.

Wide screen, color, DVD rip, excellent quality, english only, no subs.
