,polarfox,2008-01-04T01:33Z,FYI. Very slow seed. only 5-10kB/s
,polarfox,2008-01-04T01:53Z,And no quality quarantees. These files are from an old HD that had bad sectors... I'm trying to save them by seeding them to the net.
,redneck1980wi,2008-01-05T21:48Z,about a third of the tracks look like they are corrupted
,Throdne,2008-01-06T02:54Z,"Yeah, i'm having some problems with Files:
06_Rainbow_Six.mp3
07_Rainbow_Six.mp3
08_Rainbow_Six.mp3
09_Rainbow_Six.mp3
15_Rainbow_Six.mp3
16_Rainbow_Six.mp3

19_Rainbow_Six.mp3
20_Rainbow_Six.mp3
21_Rainbow_Six.mp3
22_Rainbow_Six.mp3
23_Rainbow_Six.mp3

Maybe you should Stop seeding this one and start a new seed. with the correct working files. but, if you can't that's fine. but try to restore the files, i would love to have this torrent."
