This is the instructional DVD that paintball team Powertrip from Sweden made because we were tired of answering the same question over and over about what paintball is.

It's a few years old so you might find it a little bit dated regarding equipment and 
such, but the basics of the game are still the same if you try to explain to someone that doesn't know about paintball.

This is a complete ISO of the DVD, mount it or burn it to DVD and enjoy. If you Don't like the subtitles you can turn them off, sorry English isn't my native language.
