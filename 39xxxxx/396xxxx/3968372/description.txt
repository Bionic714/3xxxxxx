While Bounce: Behind the Velvet Rope doesn't condone the brutality of nightclub bouncers, it doesn't discourage it, either. Originally shown on HBO, this profile of American and British bouncers is sure to fascinate denizens of big-city nightlife, and frighten anyone who's ever worried about choking on a knuckle sandwich. With no consistent tone, the documentary shifts from adoration toward legendary London bouncer Lenny "the Guv'nor" McLean (who died shortly after appearing in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), to cautionary appraisal of New York bouncer Jordan Maldonado, who teaches his young children that "hurting people is good." Identical twins Mike and Frank DiMaio are set up for ridicule as they hilariously murder the English language, but when family man Terence "the Black Prince" Buckley gets a much-needed bouncer job at Manhattan's elite Chaos club, the moment is touchingly sincere. By allowing its subjects to speak for themselves, Bounce proves that not all burly doormen are bloodthirsty Neanderthals. They just really like their jobs.
