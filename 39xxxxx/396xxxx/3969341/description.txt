Radioheads' classic "Kid A" has a strange property.

Play two copies of the album 17 seconds apart, and they overlap and itersect to create new harmonies, call and response vocals, and other interesting effects.

Sounds weird on some tracks, but I have come to like it quite a bit.

Enjoy and please seed to others :-)
