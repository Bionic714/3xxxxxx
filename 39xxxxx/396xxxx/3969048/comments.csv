When you install and use keymaker, sometimes it will ask you for your registered email... This means that that key has been used...
just click cancel to stop registering. then change the key to a new one in windows registry: Local Machine\software\TrendMicro\Pc-Cillin
Now paste a new key into the serial number entry. and go into the program and click Fix now where it shows the problems I had to do this a couple of times and then it allowed me to register with a new email. Hope someone finds this useful."
