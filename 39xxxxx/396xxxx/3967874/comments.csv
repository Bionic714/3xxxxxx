I can seed about 10 hours a day or so, and the total album is 139 MB, so it will take a while.
But please hang on and seed yourself when you have completed the download.
Good night everyone"

Do you have any idea in what year this was released? Discogs.com doesn't list this album..."
,SU33,2008-01-17T21:41Z,"Sorry, should've read better. It wasn't released at all."
,stinkpants,2008-03-05T14:50Z,"I'd heard rumors of its existence after the release of Gulag Orkestrar, and alas, here it is!  Thank you so much.  

I have a copy of their ""Black Session"" from French Radio last November I'll try and get up as well. "
,stinkpants,2008-05-23T10:46Z,"Ok, I fucked up in naming the French Radio bootleg torrent, forgot to put ""Beirut"" in the thing.  Here is is though.  http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4201694/Bootleg_11_24_07.zip"
