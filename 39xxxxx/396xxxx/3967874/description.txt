This is RARE FUCKING SHIT! Please seed til you have a ratio above 1.

This is the first album from Beirut aka Zach Condon, when he was writing under the name "THe Real People". This is a 21 track untitled-songs album.

Like many aspiring musicians, Condon dabbled in cassette demos and solo electronic ponderings before his Beirut days.

"This album has never been released, is not available for sale, and has never been seen or heard by anyone other than a handful of people who have personally received a copy of this record. It pre-dates all of his work with Beirut and does not bear any influence of the Balkan/Eastern Gypsy sound that he has become reknowned and critically acclaimed for; however, it's a highly precocious album that's steeped in amazing melodies draped against a backdrop of synthesized electronica: imagine an entire electronic/experimental album in the style of Scenic World with Zach's distinctive vocals and the occasional appearance of his famous brass instrumentation."

No tracklisting as all tracks are untitled.

Enjoy :-)
