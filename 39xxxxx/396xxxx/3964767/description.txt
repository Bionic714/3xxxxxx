The Ray Moody Trio
(2003)

Brooklyn-based and Bay Area-bred DJ/producer Systemaddict and Philadelphia keyboardist/pianist tafkapao's collaboration was an experiment in fusing the disparate elements of the astounding jazz and hip-hop sensibilities of one of the nation's most gifted turntablists with the experimental jazz and classical improvisations of the Philadelphia composer/pianist. The result is an album that touches on multiple aesthetics and genres with a smooth, confident ease, remaining cerebral and thought-provoking while maintaining a laid-back vibe and just sounding damned good.  Definitely worth a listen.
