,TooLF8th,2008-01-31T12:56Z,"Hi, I was thinking of uploading complete Pride FC, Complete Pride GP and Complete Pride Bushido in 3 torrents, but I have no clue how to do it, making the folders ready with the different events is no problem, but putting it out for other people to download...heh, I`m stuck. 
Please give some tips or links on ""how to"" and I shall reward all you Pride fans with an orgasmic compilation of bloody MMA chaos. ;)"

,jam1e3,2009-11-10T16:03Z,"To the 7 people seeding I would like to say thank-you so much! You guys are awesome. To the 130 something others: guys, please seed generously. This is a HUGE file and none of us will get to the end of it at this rate. I've been downloading for over 6 weeks now and seen a lot of people leeching. Don't be a dick, give back more than you took and keep the stream healthy! "
,Rude_82,2009-11-15T16:13Z,"Thank you so much.
fell in love with mma not to long ago and this will entertain me for some time;)

Will seed forever!"
,SEMTEXBHOY,2009-12-16T05:22Z,salas83 you rule. but could i be a dick and ask that you please break this up into smaller more managable chunks about five or six gigs each as this would take about three years constant downloading for me to DL.
,Douche88,2010-02-02T05:43Z,HOLY SHIT this is a huge file...  You cant really get this in a single month unless u have absolutely no download limits.
,phantasmzombie,2010-03-22T17:11Z,"I am going to break this down into single events if anyone is interested, just click on my name, i started uploading them last night."
,ThAz78,2010-05-25T14:15Z,"Hi guys, i may be mistaken, but i think a CD is missing : 
pride.fc.total.elimination.2005.ppv-w4f.disc.3

why ? cause i didn't see the 3 last fights :
Kazushi Sakuraba vs. Yoon Dong Sik
Quinton Jackson vs. Mauricio Rua
Wanderlei Silva vs. Hidehiko Yoshida

Salas83 ?? guys ?? Precise question for the hardcore fans ^_-"
,gweebz,2010-06-29T08:02Z,I downloaded this like 2 years ago and I was seeding it for a long ass time and then my computer died like a month ago. I just got a new one up and running so I will start seeding again tonight!
,SEMTEXBHOY,2010-09-30T00:28Z,"to the ninteen people seeding this, can someone please break it up into smaller files. over the course of three months i had downloaded about 75% of this file before my computer crashed and i lost everything.

please someone break it up into groups of 4 or 5 events like has been done with the UFC's. single events die to easily as a few people download them too quickly and soon people stop seeding. but groups of four or five fights take longer to download and will be alive for much longer."
,felipon,2010-11-22T05:38Z,"Hey all you MMA-FANS. Please fucking start seeding!
And i dont mean for a few hours i mean WEEKS!
DonÂ´t be fags, do some proper fucking seeding!

,ekimiscoolio,2011-08-31T17:17Z,SEED PLEASE!
,dldldld,2011-09-23T20:34Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!!@#@

you will waste your time!

1. it isnt even all of the pride events so go fuck yourself for saying it is.
2. every single one of the vids cuts in and out of track and it is BULLSHIT!
i was really excited to see this torrent but honestly now im just pissed the fuck off on how shitty it is"
,CavemanJesus,2011-09-26T03:27Z,where's part 3 of the 2005 Grand Prix of total elimination???

,GradeAPlonker,2012-05-09T02:32Z,"What a find!  Please seed this guys, I am so happy to be getting this much sweet MMA action."
,FyiMfer,2012-06-12T16:10Z,"People can complain all they want, about quality issues and the fact that this is missing a couple GP events - but in the end, this is the most complete PRIDE collection you can get in one single torrent.  Even obtaining a complete DVD collection is a bit of a challenge to get these days.  And if you don't want to buy them, then don't bitch.  Someone went through A HELL of alot of trouble to give these monumental and memorable events to MMA fans who can't afford to but the whole set.  It seems like just yesterday that I was watching these events and a torrent like this that's still alive after over 4 years - words cannot express my gratitude to the OP and everyone who's kept this torrent alive.  Sometimes I shed a tear thinking back on the good ol' days of extreme big time MMA and I consider myself lucky to have found such a torrent.  In conclusion, fuck all you people complaining.  You want to see the rest, than save up your earnings for some time and buy the rest.  Be glad you don't have to scour the internet, PAYING FOR a complete set.  Geez, sometimes the human race really lets me down."
