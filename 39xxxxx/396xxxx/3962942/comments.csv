,oakland_831,2008-01-09T07:05Z,is it the trial 
[T],castortroy4693,2008-01-10T06:05Z,"No.

Norton 2007 version 10.2 is the last version that allows you to activate the software via phone.  That is how the Keygen included in the download works.

There is very detailed instructions on how to install this and how to use the keygen included in the download."
,needporn1,2008-01-15T03:25Z,"So far, so good.
Just downloaded.....fast.
There are no keygen instruction included, just look-up ""Edge keygen"".
EDGE Keygen works.
The activation process works.
Updates downloading now.
I will update if i run into any issues."
,oknuts2,2008-01-19T19:48Z,"Can't find any README file when I tray to activate it, I got the answer that it has been activatet to many times.
may be I am to late?"
,CreativeHenke,2008-01-24T18:46Z,"seed!!
Is it workong?"
[T],castortroy4693,2008-02-05T16:14Z,"No

To activate it, you have to be disconnected from the internet.  If you are using broad band, then disconnect the network cable from your PC. 

Then start the activation wizard.  It will tell you that you need to be connected to the internet.  Click next, wait a minute, then it'll say you must be connected to the internet to activate.  Click next again, then it will try to activate it again.  After the 2nd time, it will give you the option to activate over the internet or over the phone.  Click on Activate Over the Phone, then use the keygen that came with the program, type in the numbers that it shows in the activation wizard, then click on Generate, and type in the Activation number in the Norton Wizard.

Once it has finish, re-connect your internet connection, and you should be good.

Keep in mind that if you had any Norton 2008 products installed before you installed NIS 2007, you will need to uninstall NIS 2007, any Norton 2008 programs, then go into the C:\Program Files \ and delete any folder names Symantec. (do this after you uninstaller the programs!).  Reboot then re-install NIS 2007."
,egress63,2008-02-06T18:34Z,Hi! I just scanned the .rar file (thru Norton 2006) and it says that this file has a trojan. I request castortroy4693 to please clarify regarding this.
,theNuance,2008-02-10T23:45Z,"Hello, I can't find the keygen or the detailed instructions on how to start this, and it says I need a product key.

Email me at jedi_shadeslayer@hotmail.com if you can help :)"
[T],castortroy4693,2008-02-14T16:04Z,"Do you remember what file said was infected in the archive?

I'll check it again tonight."
,theNuance,2008-02-15T05:20Z,"Do NOT download this. There is a virus in it called ""Trojan Horse."""
[T],castortroy4693,2008-02-20T23:25Z,"Okay, I scanned it again, and I'm not seeing anything.  Is the file that is popping up as a virus the keygen?

I have seen it a lot with Keygens that they often show as a virus, even though they are clean.

I've used this on my system, and other systems, and it hasn't caused me any problems.

""Trojan.Horse"" is a pretty generic name, so please point me to the file that you are claiming has the virus, so I can look into it further."
,dirtmagurt,2008-03-02T13:08Z,where is the key gen i cant find it in the files?
,T1T4N111,2008-03-06T19:50Z,"OKAY: so I downloaded the torrent and it worked beautifully. At first I had trouble making it work, but snooping around the internet helped: MAKE SURE YOUR INTERNET IS OFF WHEN U START INSTALLATION, use the keygen in the folder *EDGE*, then go through the installation after inputting key from keygen, then it will ask u to activate online, press ok go through this step twice at which point a browser will open. cose the browser, and at some point they are going to give u a long code to give to the tele operator, which u plug ino the bottom part of the EDGE keygen. Then they give u a code which u put into that page, then ur done. activate the net, downlaod the updates and voila!!!! thanks castortroy!!! nice software"

,1605mike,2008-06-24T17:05Z,This works perfectly. The only issue is that the keygen (EDGE) is flagged each and every time by NAV as having the TrojanHorse in it. Nav says it can not anything about it. Any suggestions from anyone?
