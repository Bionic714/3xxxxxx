,TRAX-X3,2008-01-17T22:23Z,"*Thanks ,is best torrent !"
,lpyrbby,2008-02-01T04:24Z,I'm having trouble installing. Any ideas? It seems to be having problems installing Flash 8 and the .NET framework. (I'm pretty sure I have both)
,Jayman007,2008-02-01T23:14Z,Does this come with a crack or keygen?  Has anyone successfully installed this?
,lpyrbby,2008-02-02T03:44Z,"If you install Flash 8 and Microsoft .NET prior to running setup, it should work just fine. I had to do some playing around though to figure that out. Good luck."
,teester,2008-02-13T03:26Z,"ok. Installed just fine. Did the update and then re-ran the patch as per the instructions, and now the 30 day registration has popped up again! Anyone find a way to combat that yet?"
,bethgo,2008-02-18T23:59Z,"Was able to successfully download, mount and install. Before installing, please read the crack folder where there is a notepad instruction. Follow the step by step instructions. Everything seems to be working fine. Use the Keygen to generate the required license #, copy the product key provided. continue until you have finally completed installation.  Always remember to backup your old data files, just in case something goes wrong before full conversion of files. Use restore file options and it will automatically convert the old data file to make it work using Quickbooks Enterprise Solution Ver 8.0.  Did not get any expiration pop ups so far. Looks OK to me...."
,bethgo,2008-02-21T14:46Z,"The reason why you are getting the expiration message is because you did your online updates.  Even with the older version, once an update is made, your software will expire soon unless you have it licensed.  Just ignore updates and you will continue to have the software working for you without any expiration or trial period to fall due..."
,bethgo,2008-03-05T00:14Z,"If you want Quickbooks to work without any updates or expiry bugging you, please follow this instructions:
1. after downloading, mount it to get the complete files.
2. Before you install, make sure you have your windows xp fully updated. Disable all other software running, including virus scan utilities.
3. Install as you normally do with any software. Use the keygen to generate the required License key, and use the product # in the notes. When you reach the portion where you are asked to do automatic update, say NO. As updating will later give you an expiry on the software.
4. continue until you finish. Apply the patch in the program files at your C: drive or any other drive where you stored the program.
5. Go to the program file, do a crack on the patch.
6. Open Quickbooks, go to help, automatic updates, disable it with a NO.
7. Press Start, run, msconfig, startup, look for the quickbooks file listed in the items found in startup, uncheck it.
YOU ARE ALL ALL SET TO ENJOY USING QUICKBOOKS WITH NO EXPIRY NO UPDATES NECESSARY. Just like all previous Quickbooks Enterprise Solutions, once updated, the program expires as it will start asking for activation on license/product key from Intuit."
,skeetmann,2008-04-09T19:23Z,"Hmmm...I have problems installing, too.  I get an .fcs error and a Net Framework error.  I've tried to install on 3 different computers, with same error.  Might be a corrupted download, so I'll re-download.  Keygen does work--thanks for providing keygen!  Keygen makers are AWESOME!  "
,skeetmann,2008-04-09T22:37Z,"I wanted to take the time to update my previous comment.  I did get this to work.  Originally, I tried to mount the .iso image with Daemon Tools & Power ISO and then install.  That's what gave me the errors.  I then thought, as a last resort, I'd try it the old fashioned way--I actually burned the image to a CD.  I ran the setup.exe from the CD and it worked perfectly!  The Keygen and patch work flawlessly, as well.  

I've been waiting for this release for some time...LineZero, u ROCK!  Awesome job!  "
,kingmony,2008-04-30T15:31Z,This current patch disables quickbooks simple start edition. This will also prevent using quickbooks sdk and using any other software with quickbooks data. Does anybody have any other patch for the features.dll file. Or perhaps a coder can modify this patch. Any help will be appreciated. 
,hell_madok,2008-05-22T05:30Z,"Yeah, QuickBoooks is very good and the better financial software ever. But with this LZ0 release, unfortunatelly they patched it in a way that QuickBooks SDK won't work, so QB becomes useless without this feature. I hope LZ0 could clean their shit or someone else can find a fix for this."
,latin110,2008-06-14T13:32Z,"Is this US, UK or CAN version. Also anyone know if you can transfer files from a previous version?"
,edmore,2008-06-24T23:51Z,"Downloaded and installed this brilliant program, Quickbooks Accountant Edition. First time using QB. Looks like its a UK Version. Invoices etc are in pound sterling. Brilliant torrent."
