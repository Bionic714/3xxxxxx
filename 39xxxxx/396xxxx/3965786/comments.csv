don't waste your time"
,wheelie2006,2008-01-14T01:07Z,quality 9/10 excellent thx for the upload only thing missing is closing credits - funny how the neg comments come from people with no torrnts to their name!!!!!!
,stateofdreaming,2008-01-14T19:01Z,I think it's funny just how little other people care about how many torrents someone has uploaded when they give valuable info about a torrent when the uploader doesn't bother.
,Adastra,2008-01-14T23:36Z,Its my first attempt at uploading - I value all feedback but with 200 seeders I think it says enough - my appologies if it doesn't come up to the required standard

[T],despo1ler,2008-01-17T01:26Z,or just use winavi converter to convert to kvcd format and burn onto a cd which will play in any dvd player
[T],despo1ler,2008-01-17T01:28Z,"and babygirl, try checking ur firewall and port forwarding on your router/modem, make  sure you have told ur firewall to allow ur torrent client access to the internet"
,lSyKol,2008-05-14T14:30Z,i normally use convertxtofdvd... in my opinion its the best. it can covert any file format to dvd and auto-burn after coverting is complete
