Episode 027: Sketching


Meet the Gimp! is a weekly video podcast or tutorial about the Gimp graphics software from the viewpoint of a digital photographer. More information at http://meetthegimp.org


It's again time for a video by Joseph. He has explored a way to let photographies look like sketches.

I then try to explain what's happening behind the scenes and present one of the images of the meetthegimp.org photogroup at 23hq.com.

Joseph used music from ccmixter (Ana (hisboyelroy_s_smooth_dub) by hisboyelroy) during his video.
