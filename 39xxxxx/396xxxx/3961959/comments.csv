,splicerd,2008-01-05T12:21Z,"I noticed an error, but there's an easy fix.

""Hallowed Be Thy Name"" is missing from album #3 - ""The Number Of The Beast"".
You can copy the exact recording from album #14 ""Best Of The Beast"" and paste it into the correct location. Rename it track #309.

Sorry for the trouble."

,warriorinc,2009-07-02T13:32Z,I recommend this site to Maiden Fans who have bought Maiden CDs in the past. I don't think the band minds downloading if you paid your good money for their work already. But if you like it please buy it support Maiden we are the loyalist fans in the world. 
,warriorinc,2009-07-02T13:34Z,I must have bought Piece of Mind & The Number of the Beast 10 times each in my life time. I don't think Iron Maiden Holdings LTD would mind me downloading what I already paid for thanks again Blood Brothers.
