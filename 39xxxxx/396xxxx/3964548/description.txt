HANGING BY A NAME is first and foremost the end result from the collaboration of three musicians that make up the band.
Duarte Feliciano, Jo?o Santiago and Ad?lio Sousa are a trio by choice, not by accident.

Urban by nature, their music reveals itself through landscapes created by beautifully open eerie guitar sounds, that quickly alternate into explosions of odd time signature drum patterns, always supported by bass lines both intricate and powerful, in an all out effort to capture in music all nuances of the intense life stories depicted by their lyrics.

Theirs is a language of small pieces of cinematographic exposure to music, film, literature, photography that aggregates into something new and full of individuality. A complex alternative power rock picture that aims to carve it's own place in the music universe.
