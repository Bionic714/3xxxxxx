Plop, Klus, Lui and Kwebbel are gathering berries in the forest. Suddenly they hear violin music, which Plop tells must be from the big people living at the edge of the forest, and we see a young girl (granddaughter of a famous female violin player) practicing, with her father nervous for the performance for the audience for the centennial anniversary of her school. Lui goes with Klus to watch the violin itself.
