This mini-album is the work of Miss La & Felix Deluxe of b-side records, an independent label based in Raglan, Aotearoa New Zealand.

Often described as a soundtrack to a movie you haven't seen yet, there are definitely "filmic" and dramatic elements to this music, all wrapped up in a lot of soul and groove.

There's also a certain dark, chilling beauty to it which should be enjoyed by fans of Moloko, Massive, Zero 7 etc.

****When this torrent sticks at 99.9%, it's done. Enjoy.
