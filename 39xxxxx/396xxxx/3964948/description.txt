AC/DC
22 August 1978 
Cleveland, Agora Ballroom

Quality - soundboard (fm, if you want to be pedantic), and a great show

For me, this is the best ACDC live recording out there!  Great show, great setlist, wild audience, superb recording.  Highly recommended!

For me, these are the best ACDC concerts available -

1.	22 August 1977 Cleveland (Burning Balls)
2.      21 August 1978 Boston, Paradise Theatre
3.	3 September 1977 San Francisco, Old Waldorf
4.	30 April 1978 Glasgow [If you want Blood (You've got it)]
5.	8 August 1978 Nashville (Blues Booze 'n' Tattoos)
6.	2 November 1979 London (Angus Cha Cha)

#1-3, are at small venues, with a crowd that goes apeshit, and the sound and atmosphere are immediate in a manner missing from the official live album.  And no prizes for guessing my favourite era for the band... If only the professionally recorded 1977 Sydney Bondi Lifesaver gig were to show up...
#5 has little in the way of audible crowd response, and the 1979 shows I find more predictable, and with "Highway to Hell", they'd lost their original rawness/bluesiness and were better as a studio band.
