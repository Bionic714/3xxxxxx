I've been looking for this for years.I have this concet on an audio casette, which i bought in 1993, but i've never known where this concert was performed. If anybody reads this, please seed it, otherwise i'll seed it for ages:)It is the best AC/DC live performance i've known. My favourite is ""She's got balls"" performed live in a manner that made AC/DC my favourite band ever."
