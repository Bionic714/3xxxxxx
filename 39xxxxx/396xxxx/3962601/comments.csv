Maybe rip 4 2 dvd's l8er?"
,vaino666,2008-01-05T17:12Z,"Movie this long would be better to keep dvd9. Also splitting it to 2 dvd5 could be possible. I made Shcindler's List (long movie too) two  dvd5 in one private torrent site. Of course thre was opinions: Two disks, I won't change them between movie (althoug the original was splitted to 2 disks)"

,ThomasWolf,2008-06-08T20:56Z,"Works great, download was fast and I'm seeding. Anyhow the picture was good for the movie being so long, even on a large screen-tv. Btw I prefer movies that are around 4,3 GB since then I can burn them on one non-double layer DVD.

Cheers and thanks!"
