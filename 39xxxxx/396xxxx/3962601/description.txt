It\\\\\\\'s a very long movie. 3h 14 mins. There is no way to get bitrate over 3000 kbps. Avarage bitrate is low 2663, but the movie is good and I have not found any good dvd5 version of this movie. 
I updated my programs Rebuilder to v 1.26.5 and major update CinemaCraft encoder from version SP v2.70.. to version SP2 v1.0.0.18. Now we can see what CCE new version can do.
This time I put there two samples. The original and mine compressed that you can compare results. You can download only the samples first.

Tested with: Mediaplayer 11, Mediaplayer classic, Power Dvd, KMPlayer,Inter Video Dvd and stand alone players.
