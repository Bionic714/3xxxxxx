,kovesp,2008-01-09T01:19Z,"I'm incredibly grateful for all the Fassbinder posts! I've seen many of the movies earlier, but don't have them (only the BRD Trilogy: Lola/Veronica Voss/Maria Braun).

A request: I managed to get almost all of the 6 DVD Alexanderplatz post, except for a single 4MB piece of DVD 4. ANy chance you could post that piece as a separate torrent? I added a note to the discussion for DVD 1 of that series on how the pice can be extracted from the ISO file... Hope you can do this, thanks in advance."
