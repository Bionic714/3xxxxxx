Drama from 1974   Rainer Werner Fassbinder 

Margit Carstensen   Karlheinz BÃ¶hm. 




Margit Carstensen stars as a young woman who finds herself slowly stripped of her 

freedom by her sadistic and tyrannical husband. Fassbinder's bold homage to 

Douglas Sirk's 1950s Technicolor melodramas finds him at his most wickedly 

perverse and stylistically assured.
