I'm back on now, and I see quite a few people want it, I only get about 30KBps, on a good day, 35, so I can't do it all on my own! If you get it, seed it too!

Thanks for all your help,

,Jake_Watkins,2008-02-01T23:48Z,"Sorry about the downtime. I usually get on/stay on at night (10 Eastern) and keep it on until about 4 PM (eastern) so just open it, and I'll be on later in the evenings = )"

,soccerscrew,2009-01-04T17:23Z,how do you convert from rar file to play on pc
,SchoolyardKiller,2009-09-19T23:22Z,"You don't convert .rar files, you just extract the containing files from them with a program like winRAR."
,erinlovely,2009-11-13T20:46Z,It wont start. That thing saying there are seeders lies or something.
