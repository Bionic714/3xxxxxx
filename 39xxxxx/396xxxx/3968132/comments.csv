,darklemming,2008-01-21T18:49Z,"THIS IS AN OPEN COMMENT TO ALL THE UPLOADERS!

Can you please properly tag all the songs that you upload. It is like have a second job just to organize my music library. And everyone who downloads these music songs has to tag and organize them, some of the lazy people just toss it in and have a ""whatever-the-fuck cluster-fuck"" of a music library.

Some of us freedom fighters would like not to have to slave constantly to properly ID3 tag the songs we download.

Thank you again uploaders for understanding."
,kai696,2008-02-14T00:28Z,"You stupid asshole. You illegaly download music. You don't have the right to tell anyone what to do; sure it's a piss off to get proper ID3 tags, but fuck, if you want to have properly labeled music, go buy it."
