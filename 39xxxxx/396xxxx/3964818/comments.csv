,Diceman_,2008-06-13T18:56Z,"I downloaded a Short History of Nearly Everything, Notes from a Small Island, and A walk in the woods and none of them are read by Bill Bryson despite what the information on other sites may say."
,Diceman_,2008-08-24T16:51Z,The narrator of A Short History of Nearly Everything is first-rate so in that instance it doesn't matter.
,Diceman_,2008-11-06T15:39Z,"Sorry for all these comments, but A Walk in the Woods and In a Sunburned country are badly encoded (64kbps 44khz stereo) so download higher quality ones elsewhere (alas I did not find a higher quality version of A Walk in the Woods).

Here's a breakdown:

-Short History of Nearly Everything narrated by Richard Matthews - 64kbps 44khz mono (great)
-Shakespeare The World as Stage narrated by Bill Bryson 128kbps 44khz stereo (good)
-Notes from a Small Island tracks narrated by Ron McLaherty 64kbps ABR 44khz mono (except for track 1, great)
-In a Sunburned Country narated by Bill Bryson 64kbps 44khz stereo (avoid)
-A walk in the woods narrated by William Roberts 64kbps 44khz stereo (couldn't find it anywhere else, heavy equalisation required)"

Thanks for making the effort to upload, I know you didn't make the audiobook, but if someone knows of another version, hopefully read by Bill please post a link here.
Sorry to moan, but Christ listening to it was pissing me off!"
