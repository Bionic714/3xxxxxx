,timsterguy,2008-01-15T04:21Z,"please seed, can't get past 69%.  (ironic even)"
,drx86,2008-01-17T09:49Z,come back uploader!!!
,drx86,2008-01-17T14:38Z,"Dude, pelon, what's the status buddy?

If for whatever reason you can't finish seeding this let me know (I'll get it from a private tracker and share here).

There's 155 people waiting on this, so yeah, don't keep us hanging :)

Thanks,
drx86"
,www.thebeyond.info,2008-01-17T22:46Z,"I'm at 81% on this right now. It's taking forever, but I promise to seed it for a while for the rest of you guys. (PUA guys SHOULD be helping each other)

I can't seed it for TOO long (a few days)tho because I dont have a lot of space on my hard drive and I gotta get rid of it. Lets hope some of you will follow suit and keep the torernt going."
,Tango-,2008-01-18T07:14Z,This is brutal you guys. If any of you guys can seed it I would be in your debt. I have been at 82 percent for quiiiite some time. Pretty depressing.
,drx86,2008-01-18T07:23Z,"Up to 82.1%, so we are making progress -- albeit very very slowly.

Has anyone else watched the start of disc2? BUUUUTANNNOOOOO!!"
,www.thebeyond.info,2008-01-18T07:49Z,"I'm with you Drx.. 82.1 and it aint goin nowhere. Like I said tho, when it's done, I'll try to seed it long enough for more people to finish, and start seeding to make the torrent healthy. After a couple of days of seeding, it SHOULD get better.(assuming others agree to seed) Having the same problem with Mind Of Mystery."
,Tango-,2008-01-18T08:19Z,"that was classic. Just watch a little bit after that, its starts messing up a bit, but its still worth it. The story about the revenge f#$% is classic trust me."
,drx86,2008-01-18T11:36Z,"Heh awesome.

We're now up to 162 peers...  so the speeds should eventually start to pick up.


Oh btw, everybody prioritize disc2."
,timsterguy,2008-01-19T08:52Z,keep on seeding dude!
,citral,2008-01-20T19:38Z,"Someone, please seed this! It's dead at 83%"
,bugmenoht,2008-01-20T20:21Z,"for FUCKS sake, man.  it's been stuck at 83% for days now, almost two weeks after the torrent was created.  

if you're uploading something, commit to seed it through!!  you're supposed to do us a favor here; hell, now I'm actually WORSE off than before when I didn't have it at all."
,pelon_pirate,2008-01-20T23:18Z,RELAX FUCKERS I WAS OFFLINE.....  ITS GONNA BE UP AGAIN....
,pelon_pirate,2008-01-20T23:32Z,"HAVE ANY OF YOUR UPLOADED ANYTHING.... AT ALL???????..... AT LEAST AN MP3 THAT SAYS ""SEED BITCHES...."""
,www.thebeyond.info,2008-01-21T00:53Z,Not everyone is giving you an attitude. It's mostly for those that finish downloading and don't seed. I'm sure I speak for some of the other guys here when I say that you uploading this stuff IS appreciated. 
,drx86,2008-01-21T03:21Z,"Up from ~0.3kB/s to ~50kB/s... w00t!

Appreciate it Pelon, keep up the good work mate."
