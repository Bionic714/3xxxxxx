Registry Mechanic is an advanced registry cleaner for Windows that allows you 
to safely scan, clean, and repair registry problems with a few simple mouse 
clicks. Problems with the Windows Registry are a common cause of Windows 
crashes and error messages. By using PC tune-up utilities such as registry 
cleaners regularly, your system will be more stable, your software will run 
quicker, and your operating system will boot faster. Registry problems can 
occur for many reasons, including references left behind after 
uninstallation; incorrect removal of software; missing or corrupt hardware 
drivers; or orphaned start-up programs. With a few easy steps, Registry 
Mechanic will scan your entire registry for any invalid entries and provide a 
list of the errors found. You then can choose to clean each item or 
automatically repair them all after making a backup without the need for a 
registry editor such as Regedit. PC Tools products are free of spyware and 
adware.
