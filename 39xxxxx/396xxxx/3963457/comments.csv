,alt.slack,2008-01-17T19:20Z,"Great music, too bad one good game still doesn't warrant to overpriced Orange Box.  Portal was brillieant.  EP1/2 were just as big of a letdown as HL2 was, and Valve totally fucked up with TF2, simplified the gameplay down to nothing.  Would have been awesome to have TF1/TFC over the tope style gameplay with the new art style."
,JakoB_teh_king,2008-03-15T18:52Z,"alt.slack got it wrong!
Nice upload btw."
,Nordaq,2008-04-30T00:14Z,"I personally didnt play on earlier incarnations of Team Fortress, but I think Team Fortress 2, and the rest of the games in the Orange Box are fantastic. So is the music :D"
,r1r22,2008-06-04T13:20Z,"alt.slack, what the hell are you on? Half Life 2 was the complete opposite of a letdown, its possibly one of the best and innovative games of all time, and Episodes 1 and 2 where even further triumphs. i only bought the orange box for Half Life 2, and i would've paid the same for just that - i dont really play TF as its not my sort of thing, but Portal rocks!"
,r1r22,2008-06-04T13:22Z,"oh, and to whoever posted this, this is not the coplete soundtrack to the orange box, where the hell is the Half Life 2 music?"
