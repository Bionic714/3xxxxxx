This is a legal share. Once they had a link on the Bunny website, so you could download this package of icons, but now it seems to have disappeared. That's why I decided to share this icon package as a torrent.

This file has 98 JPG images from Bunny the comic, 100 x 100 px each. You can use these as avatars on forums or livejournal or wherever.

Thank you, Lem, for an amazing comic.
