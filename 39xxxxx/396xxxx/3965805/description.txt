Synopsis

Jim Douglas (Gregory Peck) rides into town the night before the hanging of four outlaws. HeÃ?Â´s been on their trail, believing they raped and killed his wife. But hours before the execution, the four escape, taking a beautiful young woman hostage. Now itÃ?Â´s a murderous race to the Mexican border. Taking charge of the posse, Douglas tracks down the criminals one by one-until the stunning, powerful conclusion reveals a terrible secret that leaves Douglas more desperate for salvation than revenge!..
