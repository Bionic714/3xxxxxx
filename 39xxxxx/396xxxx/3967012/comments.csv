,DaXimaX,2008-04-15T15:03Z,Yea its a really bad torrent.. Just some old songs from Eminem!!!
,skrbzz,2008-04-20T18:34Z,"ya this is bullshit this ani't his new cd 
Why tow reason 
1: theres a remixs wit ja rule and they have a big beef between them 
2: Em wouldn't waste time remixn his old music cause he made enough of it whne he released it before ome on don't beleive this idot if ur a true slim shady fan you will think the same and if anyone thinks different (GOOD CAUSE I STILL DON'T GIVE A FUCK HAHAH)"
,YOUKNOWWHOITIZ,2008-04-27T17:25Z,his is a mixtape by DJ Invasion filled with blends and remixes bottom line NOT REAL KING MATHERS!
,ciaranmcilvenna,2008-05-05T20:55Z,"just remixes of old songs
nothin new...
but nicely done
none of the tracks are mismatched or off beat
still a good cd if you're an eminem fan..."
,sonofmud,2008-06-02T18:31Z,"Makes a reference to Proof that was shot last year. Maybe not the real King Mathers, well worth the down.

Thanks for the down."
