Unlike all the rest of my uploads, this one is NOT an acdc bootleg.   

Its just a funny song about meth heads, or CRANKSTERS...

Written and recorded by Mr T Porter.


In the late night hour when everyone is asleep... Out come the cranksters and all of the tweeks.
Up for weeks, but not really caring, out the back window a man is staring, into the dark he swears he hear voices... Up for five days, its his mind making noises...

Really a fun song for anyone whose ever used meth.
