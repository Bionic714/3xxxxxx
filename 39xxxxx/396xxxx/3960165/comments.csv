,qvboy,2010-12-08T17:47Z,"To reactivate the DEMO-License:

Delete the file ""control.ini"" in
c:\windows

(Make backup before, just in case..)

Remove following registry-entry:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TTQV\4\Settings

I use a batch file to do this every time I start TTQV:
Create a batch file ""ResetTTQV.bat"" with the following content: (without quotes)

""@echo off
del c:\windows\control.ini
regedit.exe /s ResetTTQV_DemoZeit.reg
start G:\Programme\TTQV4\Ttqv4a.exe""

replace the ""G:\Programme...."" with the directory-path of your installation directory of TTQV

Create a text file ""TTQV_DemoZeit.reg"" with following content: (without quotes) 

""Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TTQV\4\Settings]""

Save both files in your root directory on drive c:
and run the batch file to start TTQV.

This will generate a new trial period every time you start TTQV

Note: this will NOT work with TTQV 5.XXX!!!!"
