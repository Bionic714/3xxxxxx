,kudde,2008-01-08T20:30Z,"but... dont you need the wii-image aswell? this is only the windows program, nothing for the wii..."

then just go onto the internet browser on your Wii and type in:

,niksaborcic,2008-01-09T00:52Z,Nod32 won't let me install too
,Mekb9,2008-01-09T06:51Z,what is the login nummer?
,Mekb9,2008-01-09T07:37Z,how do i get it to work? I have install it on the computer then how do i get it on the wii?
,kudde,2008-01-09T19:46Z,"Got the same problem, when it starts to update library - nothing more happens... SOmeone got thisone to work?"
,FaderAbraham,2008-01-09T20:02Z,Same problem as Chris-k and kudde. Will someone please find a solution? Pretty please?
,finnfinn,2008-01-09T20:20Z,"I had the same problem when i added all my musiclibrary. Then i tried just to add a single directory with app. 50 songs. It took about 15 minutes to add those songs, but now it works. So if you have about 5000 songs in your library it might take a while"
,FaderAbraham,2008-01-09T20:34Z,"Yea. I'm searching the interwebz for the solution but all I can find is bad reviews about this software. People have the exact same problem we're having, with legitimate copies of the program. Apparently, yes, you can add music and photos if you just take some at a time. However, it will take a while, maybe hours.

Only a fortunate few("
,FaderAbraham,2008-01-09T20:36Z,"...have got it to work with video. Dylansaliba(the uploader) should be one of them.

Will you please let us know how you did, dylansaliba?"
,Slackness,2008-01-13T15:49Z,"Even if you manage to make this work it has to be one of the worst applications ever!

1, Wont remove files from the library
2, Certain filename cause scanning to crash
3, No aspect ratio recalculation
4, Sound is crappy quality
5, Media indexing is slower than Mr Slow on a slow day facing into the wind! 

Dont bother with this... you may start to self harm after a while

(PS. I dont like this application, but thx to the poster for the up anyhows)"
,Slackness,2008-01-13T17:13Z,"Forgot to add, i have tried all versions available of this via the update (the last update seems most stable of the lot) Vers 1.5.2 - It still isn't that stable.
Still not sure if the stability is due to filenames or because of the codec that was used to encode the video source."
,ezed,2008-01-15T21:29Z,"Do I have to buy the ""internet channel"" or is it possieble to download it and install in to wii. Cause I need it to connect to the mediacenter ?
BR."
,Kromgol,2008-01-16T07:47Z,ezed: You need to buy it.
,Muttman25,2008-09-26T07:41Z,"I think I finally got this to scan in my files.

When I first installed it I would tell it to use X folder for movies and Y folder for music.

Then I hit the scan button on the options to manually start the scanning process and instead of finding 0 files and then disappearing it looks like it found the 10 music files and 180 movie files it should have.

The 10 music files are showing in the media centre and I am assuming that the movie files are still indexing as media centre is using 25% of my processor still."
