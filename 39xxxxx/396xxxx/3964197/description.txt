The Deadly Knives
Shaw Brothers Celestial Remastered (Released late December)
DVDrip to DIVX Ultra Insane Quality
Mandarin language only, embedded divx ultra english/chinese subs plus english .srt file included also
Use divx ultra compatible dvd player or software to view non .srt subs and multiple language tracks (which there are none in this case)
Please seed as much as possible so I can move onto the next upload! Also please start uploading your own Shaw films! That would be a nice way of saying thanks for sharing yours that you spent a lot of money on. I don't own every movie, i only got a 100 out of many hundreds of remastered Shaw Classics so any contributions would be greatly appreciated. Or anyone willing to trade backups of Shaw dvds through the mail or something post a comment!!
