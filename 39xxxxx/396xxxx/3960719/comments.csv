,quiroga,2008-01-27T17:17Z,when does heroes E12 come out ?
,Neon33,2008-01-31T17:45Z,"I've heard that it won't come a E12. But instead a new season (3).Season 2 and 3 will be 2 shorter season and what I've heard it should come out now in January OR after the summer.

This just because of the strike in LA or something..."
,helmut_cool,2008-01-31T21:15Z,"according to Wikipedia: 
Eftersom manusfรถrfattarnas fackfรถrbund  
because the writers union Writers' Guild of America went on strike in nvember 2007 season 2 is divided into two shorter volumes than the first. Volume 2 is called ""Generations"" and volym 3 ""Villains"". Volume 3 airs 24 feb -08 i the US.

,alexander3,2008-02-20T22:28Z,"E12 will not come out, because, if you watch E11... you will se in the end ""End of Season Two"""
,flintstone101,2008-02-21T16:00Z,well if season 2 has finished when is season 3 coming any ideas
,chunkster84,2008-02-24T20:08Z,"@ :alexander3 at 2008-02-20 22:28 CET: 

E12 will not come out, because, if you watch E11... you will se in the end ""End of Season Two"" 

lol i think you need to re-watch it, does not say ""end of seaons 2"" it says ""end of VOLUME 2""
and slyer sates ""im back""... lol end of seaons 2 "
,DonVito_,2008-02-29T01:33Z,"chunkster84 I don't really think that matters anyway,""end of seaons 2"" or ""end of VOLUME 2"" it's kinda the same"
,DonVito_,2008-02-29T01:35Z,"BTW , what has syler saying ""im back"" to do with that?"
,pether,2008-03-05T16:56Z,"""On February 13, 2008 NBC announced that Heroes would return for its third season in the Fall of 2008.""


So you'll have to wait quite a bit."
,night creature,2008-03-07T06:51Z,"@pether

Ok that officially SUCKS!"
,PhoenixG,2008-03-16T16:48Z,"I'd just like to say that the heroes team officially suck major hairy balls for not being able to ride the writters strike storm thus failing to provide us with any new episodes for a year after the last showing.

Shows such as smallville and lost have managed to cope with just having a few weeks off instead.......i loved heroes but because of this it's put a black cloud over its once impeccable form!"
,Dogwine,2008-05-11T00:17Z,"PhoenixG:
Quality IS worth waiting for!!!! ;-)"
,shiabata,2008-09-19T16:32Z,"Season three comes sep 22 2008. 

Episod one: The second one
Episod two: The Butterfly Effect"
