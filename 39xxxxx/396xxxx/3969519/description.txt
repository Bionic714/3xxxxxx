Mashed Fully Loaded a.k.a. Drive to Survive [Multi5] Full Rip


Mashed Fully Loaded is a top down racing game that pits up to four players against each other in a gladiatorial racing battle extravaganza. Using a plethora of weapons or just your driving skills unleash your fury, cause absolute carnage and send your friends to a humiliating defeat!

And it?s not over there! Unique to Mashed Fully Loaded, defeated opponents will be able to sit back and target you or other remaining drivers with deadly missile air strikes. But whether they target the race leader or decide to enjoy some satisfying revenge is another matter entirely...

- Nine hi-tech weapons to pick up and unleash on your rivals including machine guns, mortars, missiles, shotguns, oil slicks, flamethrowers, mines, barrel bombs and blinding flares.
