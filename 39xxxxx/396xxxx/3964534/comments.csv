I'll seed it good."
,Maedhros1981,2008-10-29T09:17Z,"Great release.... HOWEVER....

The playlist (.m3u file) will probably only work with less than 1% of downloads, since the mp3-locations are hardcoded.

Fix:
Open the m3u file in an editor such as TextPad or PSPad and Find-Replace ""D:\Top 100 Trance and Techno Party Songs of All Time Vol. 3\"" (without quotes) .... replace this with nothing ("""")

Now you may add the playlist to your musicplayer :)"
