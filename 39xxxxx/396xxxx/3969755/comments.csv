,NephilimNexus,2008-01-18T05:31Z,"No, it doesn't work.  The original Generals half works fine, but the Zero Hour expansion half is completely bork bork borked."
,NephilimNexus,2008-01-18T05:34Z,"Actually, I take that back.  I was mixing up this file with the crappy Swedish version (doh!) sitting next to it in storage.

This one actually seems to work just fine!  Deviance is always reliable.  My mistake, sorry!"

,Deminetix,2008-05-10T07:09Z,"I'm still leeching it but i think you need to replace those files with the cracked exe's in what someone else mentioned were inside the DIRectory/folder called ""crack"""
,Deminetix,2008-05-10T07:11Z,"Woops sorry, i mean copy the generals.exe and game.dat files which are situated in the crack folder, and put them in the main game folder, which should already contain the original files and you will be overwriting them... No-cd crack i presume?"

,davve7k,2008-11-12T17:30Z,"It works fine! If you have any trouble, mail me (Rowdy0nline@hotmail.com).
But the cd-key generator sucks... use this one: 3832-8938183-6383078-0037

Do you not find the crack? Just mount disc 1 again (after install ofc) and press ""explore cd"" when the large box shows up.
There, you will find a crack, with instructions. 

/Happy play time, or something xD"
