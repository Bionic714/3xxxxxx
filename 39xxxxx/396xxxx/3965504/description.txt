This is a full rip of the first disc of Mickey Mouse in B&W vol. 1, part of the Walt Disney treasures collection. This source is not a limited edition tin-can release, but what seems to be a rerelease in common packaging. The content of the disc however should be the same.

The video format is NTSC. 

There are plans to upload disc 2 later, but that may take a while. Please note that my upload is very slow, so just be patient and be sure to seed a lot when you're done. Whatever you do, don't complain about this.
