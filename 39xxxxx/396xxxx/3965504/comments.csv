,dilbertgeg,2009-04-27T17:58Z,"Thanks to AhmedXyz.
I downloaded this and I liked it, but this is a low def ancient B+W film in high def DVD.
eh?
I had to use DVD Shrink to burn it.
I uploaded the DVD Shrink version which is only 4G. I do not see it yet on Search but go to  dilbertgeg profile. It should be a LOT faster.

Please Seed, I won't be seeding it permanently."
