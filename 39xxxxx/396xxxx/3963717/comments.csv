It is the most shattering experience of a young man's life when he awakes and quite reasonable says to himself, ""I will never play The Dane""."

,royskatt,2009-03-22T20:16Z,"stripminer: looks like you dont understand how file-sharing are working... shouting after seed wont help! Do you belive the uploaders keep their stuff stored in 10 months? as soon there are som seeders, we close it and start on next upload.

Hint to everyone: Seed when you download, and for some time after you have completed all! Then it will work for all!"
