MAJOR KNOWLEDGE!!!!!!!

For people who are really serious about learning electronics.  Lost of linear algebra and theory.  If you like it when your head hurts after you learn something major, this one is for you!  Defintely for those who want super powers!  

If you have a fair amount of patience, the material will bestow you with great knowledge.  An excellent companion for anyone taking an electronics or studio maintenance course (it helps if you have a teacher explaining this stuff to you first, then reading the book to nourish what you have learned.  Experienced ones will have a good time with this.)  Please seed, 88 megs is a lot of information!  If you like it please buy it! I'm sure Mr. Horowitz spent a long time writing this one.
