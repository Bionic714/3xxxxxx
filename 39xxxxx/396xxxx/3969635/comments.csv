Only after a repack usually do you get just a single Xvid.  What wreaks about this one is the fact that it's 2CD's for a 700mb single disk movie.  Not downloading it to find out, but I can only assume from the obvious that it's a fake."
,the_azh1976,2008-01-10T11:06Z,Guys this is my first post and all I can say its not a fake; though a cam copy but I think its watchable - the rest is up to you guys to say. I just have a 1MB connection cos thats the highest the ISP in my country could offer so sorry for slow seeding.

As for the length, the movie is about 103 minutes long. I combine files on one DVD disk and all fits just fine."
