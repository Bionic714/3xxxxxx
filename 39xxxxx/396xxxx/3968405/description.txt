DizzyEver:


This rar file is a collection off all known commercial versions of DIZZY for such systems as the ZX Spectrum , Commodore 64 , Amstrad 464 , Nes , Atari st , Amiga , Genesis , Master system and PC

The games have been put in order so if its zx spectrum you want you can easily find it by opening the zx spectrum folder where you will find an emulator , a games folder and a READ ME file , this is the same for all other versions.

There is another folder which contains cheats, walk through\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s , cassette covers/game covers and more.........


This is a work in progress which means i will be adding more Dizzy games as i come across them, though pretty much every official game is on here.

other things to add are more of those free versions magazines give away free for, and  a self boot cd iso image. but for now enjoy this great collection.

Instructions: Simply unzip using winrar then place entire folder in location on your pc and play, or drag n drop to cd and burn.
 

The rar file is 100% virus free and was made using Vista ultimate (64 bit).
