Ron Paul on PBS Now interview by Bill Moyers Jan 5 2008 Internet Freedom (the REAL freedom candidate!)

While the "US Pirate Party" proves itself a joke and a disgrace, Ron Paul speaks of not regulating the internet and getting back to personal freedom!  Obama meanwhile, meeting with his CFR co-conspirators, plots to take away freedoms and continue the global "police state."


Ron Paul: "And what I fear, and what I talk about a lot is will the government come in and have regulations on what you can say on the Internet like they have with... all these TV and radio stations, and Clear Channels and thing like that. So, are they going to control it? So, that's why I fear the regulation. I don't want the government in the business of regulating. I don't want them to regulate the Internet"
