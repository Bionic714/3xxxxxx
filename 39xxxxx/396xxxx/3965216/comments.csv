,BigDickBubba,2008-05-14T06:48Z,no comments for a 7gig download ? 
,Gh0ztly,2008-05-15T08:07Z,Please seed. I have waited a long time to get this. Finally someone with AVI and both seasons! I will comment back on quality and seed this for a while.
,Gh0ztly,2008-05-15T20:49Z,"So many peers, such a slow DL. Open up your transfer speed seeders. Geez. This is taking days when it should take an hour."
,Gh0ztly,2008-05-16T05:09Z,I guess no one wants to seed this torrent. Just a bunch of leechers. Very disappointing. =(
,Gh0ztly,2008-05-16T05:30Z,"Doing a little better now. Please seed and others seed, too. This is a huge file and will be sweet, if I ever get to watch it. 2 days later = 28% or 2.20G!"
,Gh0ztly,2008-05-17T19:08Z,"Excellent Quality. Great series! slow DL. Too many leechers, not enough seeders. Took me 3 1/2 days to DL. but all in all... Thanx."
,sweSUCKS,2008-05-24T20:50Z,Download speed: ZERO 
,sweSUCKS,2008-05-24T20:54Z,"I'm at 81,8% cmon I almoust have it help me out! 
I'll seed this for a month or so after im done. Cmon ppl =)"
,Kengyo,2008-06-08T19:42Z,"thanks to all who are seeding this torrent! seriously. however, a little increase in Upload could really help those of us who will be downloading this for a month. 
   this seems like a great torrent. i am surprised the swarm health is as strong as it is, considering the age of this series. "
,Kengyo,2008-06-13T02:40Z,still pretty weak. day 5! and apparently 10 days to go. . . will report back with finished product.
,danslittlesecret,2008-06-16T19:44Z,"32%, average 7-8kB/s. Sometimes peeks and rides at 10-12kB/s, which is sweet....."
,heretic123,2008-06-17T04:32Z,is there a censored version of season 2?
,Lavinator,2008-07-24T18:01Z,"All I need is Season 1, Episode 12. I have all the rest. Can someone please help me out? Thank you!"
[T],GrandTheftBinary4200,2008-08-29T18:49Z,"Man you people bitch way too much. 12 hours or 5 days, however long it takes, its fucking FREE. remember that. jesus."
,Killare2,2008-09-20T17:01Z,seed please!
,bondoMaga,2011-04-10T21:38Z,"Is this the Region 1 or the Region 2 DVD release?

(Region 2 has the original uncut versions of episodes 1, 2, and 3--instead of the cut-down versions originally broadcast on BBC and released on the Region 1 DVD set).

Thanx... "
