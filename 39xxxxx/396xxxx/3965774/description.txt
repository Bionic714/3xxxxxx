-go to ut2004/system folder
-paste engine.dll and IpDrv.dll into system folder (overwrite ofkors_)

this is basiclly the same patch as x86 ver. but its allready unpacked so you dont
 need to bother with that exe. file on x86 os
We actually copied and pasted  ver. from x86 sys folder that is allready patched.

it works in our house!! 
:)

enjoy,
