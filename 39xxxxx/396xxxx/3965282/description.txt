"one more present

dear friends -

the animators played our last show together in 2007, but we still have one final holiday present for you: our music.
 
http://theanimators.com

we've posted our entire catalog on our website for free download: all three studio albums, a complete recording of our final show, and a handful of unreleased tracks.  it's one last thanks to you and to all of our fans, collaborators, supporters and fellow-travelers.  we hope you'll enjoy and share our music for a long time to come.

...

from all of us, thank you again for your support through the years, and
thank you, one more time, for listening.
