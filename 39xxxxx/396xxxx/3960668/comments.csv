,Etherian,2008-05-18T00:22Z,"The readme is in an another language(of course) but it's easy enough to figure out. Works well, and I haven't seen anything about a registering, though I haven't had it for long enough to be sure."

,karin1978,2008-06-21T22:29Z,"Hi there,

I desperately need help from anyone who could do me a bigggg..gggg favor.
I have downloaded an ""ABBYY FineReader 9.0 Pros"" from quite a few people here in TPB, they are working great. 
However, since I deadly need to have the Thai language supported, which all of the downloads from here couldn't avail my need. 

I do a further research on the ABBYY website itself, and found that i need to use the updated version to get Thai language supported. 
(Reference : http://www.abbyy.com/press/press_releases.asp?param=144054)
I then started to download the installation file from ABBYY website, its size is 243 MB. 
(Reference downloaded site : http://finereader.abbyy.com/?param=137544)

BUT after downloading and installing the software, I got a BIG problem about product activation. I try to play around with merging some files from the TPB version with 

the downloaded Thai support version, never success. 

Anyone could help me out of this please? Would be truly appreciated for your help and mercy.

If anyone would be able to help me, please write me kms2547(at)h0tmail(dot)com.

Best regards,

Karin"
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2008-06-27T05:38Z,"This one seems perfect. You don't need the readme, the installer is in English (perhaps other languages as well depending on your settings) and it works. Skipped the registration and was able to start OCR'ing and the results are very good.

And, scanned with AVG pro. and installed with it active and there were no trojans or other surprises found, unlike at least one of the other available torrents for this package."
,Zoned87,2008-09-09T02:30Z,"Would someone please, PLEASE upload the newer version of this program that supports Japanese/Chinese and Hebrew.

I have tried absolutely everything to get it to work, serial hunting, cracks for older versions and even editing its registration files... the program quickly locks itself up and blocks me.... it costs $400 and I can't afford that...

,darkpoet1978,2009-08-13T05:34Z,"AVG complained about a Generic Trojan Horse in all the main setup EXEs (but not the Keygen lol).

But it runs without a problem.  Actually, this OCR software is so useful.  This is the type of program that actually seems made for widescreen monitors..."

Merci! Enfin le truc qui marche reellement. Je traduis pour les francophones. Au premier dĂŠmarrage du programme on vous propose de l'enregistrer. Choisissez l'enregistrement par fax et indiquez n'importe quoi. Pressez chaque fois ""Continuer"".  C'est tout.
DĂŠpaquetez le fichier OCR DJVU.exe. Maintenant voire programme peut lire les format DjVu."
