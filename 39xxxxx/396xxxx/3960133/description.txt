Amiga PD CD - 17-Bit - The Continuation Disc

This is the third disc of the 17-Bit Collection on Amiga formatted CD, designed to run on an Amiga with an A570 drive or CDTV. 

This CD contains a wealth of early Amiga Public Domain greats: Scene Demos, Music, Utilties, and Games.

You can also use the CDs on Windows systems, all the software is in DMS format so could be converted to ADF with DMS2ADF and then run on an emulator if you must. I've included a text file with the conents of this CD so you can have a scan through at what is included without booting it up on an Amiga, the formatting is a bit rough but I'm sure you'll cope! 

The main benefit of this CD over the previous two is that it includes a search engine not only for the titles held on this CD but also for the previous two, so boot from this CD and you can then search and extract titles from the previous two CD's (as long as you have the other CDs!).

I was able to burn these images onto CD using an NEC burner and could read it both in Windows and on my A500+ with A570.

If this is popular then I'll post the next 2 CDs in the series which feature increasingly more AGA stuff, so remember to leave comments if you want more :)
