,serapb7,2008-01-26T03:06Z,"Not infected, but not functional either. The server portion loads, binds, and displays that it can accept 1500 users; however no clients can connect."
,CrazyRuben,2008-02-06T18:54Z,"This crack works perfectly, unlike other ckracks on tpb. Just install ventsrv 2.3.X public free version.
Copy and replace the ventrilo_srv.exe with this one and whola, maxclients = 1500. Havent tried to connect 1500 clients to the server but even the ventrilo.com status page say its max 1500clients

,mikehazki,2009-01-05T05:13Z,"yeh im helping you guys out 

ok since macs cant support that shit azz codec  i want you to change something in your config file

it will look like this : VoiceCodec=0
VoiceFormat=1

VoiceCodec=3
VoiceFormat=32

now your ventrilo server supports macs and is at the max codec setting... pretty cool eh?
