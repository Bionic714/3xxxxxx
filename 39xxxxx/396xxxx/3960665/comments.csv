Folks this is Pink Floyd meets a space drone - mixed with a tinge of Steve Roach, Brian Eno, U2, and even a few Southern Rock chords floating on the wind.

Give this a try - it is much more than you would think - and great cover art too.

Impressive.

Now if only I could find someone with the keygen for Quatum Leap's Colossus - perhaps I could attempt to create something of my own.

Neuron - you have inspired me - and I can't think of a better compliment!"
