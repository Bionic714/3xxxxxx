"
,GenyrusSeedeR,2008-01-24T06:42Z,ive stopped seeding this torrent because you greedy assholes wont let me finish the last 10% of my download. i suggest any other leechers to try the other NIN discography that comes up when u run a search before starting the download for this torrent you wont get past 90 some-odd %

,SLURtheMusicJunkie,2009-08-06T19:40Z,Seed?
,Demeanor,2009-12-27T04:09Z,"I'm looking at 11 connections, all stuck at 96.5%.  I never spent much time with NIN - I just wanted it to complement my collection.

Right now, it's looking like most NIN fans aren't seeding because they're too busy jacking off at truck-stops across the world."
