Title: The Chemical Brothers - Hey Boy Hey Girl

The Chemical Brothers are the UK-based Grammy Award winning electronic music duo of Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons (occasionally referred to as Chemical Tom and Chemical Ed). Initially they called themselves \\\"The Dust Brothers\\\", after the noted United States production duo of the same name, but their burgeoning popularity and the threat of legal action from the originals led them to change their name in 1995. Along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method and the highly regarded Beastie Boys, as well as other lesser-known acts they were pioneers of the big beat electronic dance genre, and are known for high-quality live sets.
