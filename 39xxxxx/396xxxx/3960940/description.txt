Movie: Comedy Musical Western Libertarian Soundtrack Clint Eastwood Lee Marvin

"Paint Your Wagon" is he most anti-establishmentarian, pro-liberty film ever
made -- a glorious ode to drinkin', smokin' and the 3rd thing; so drop those
narrow-minded attitudes and head on over to Rotten Luck Willie's down in "No
Name City" to get rid of that hollow, empty feeling. Bring your gold dust...

Fresh from his "Dollars" trilogy, you wouldn't think anybody could upstage
Clint Eastwood; but Lee Marvin chews up the screen like a famished tiger that
hasn't seen a decent piece of raw meat in weeks. Marvin won an Academy Award
best-actor Oscar for "Cat Bellou", but this is his better comic work.
