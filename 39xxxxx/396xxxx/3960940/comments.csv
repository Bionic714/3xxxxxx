,tdatb,2009-03-22T06:43Z,"Hmmmm, didn't the crazy Georgian (Stalin) kill about 20,000,000 of his own Soviet citizens? 

Communism was never anything more than an excuse for a small group of elitist imperialists to seize power and expand the reach of their power as far across the world as they possibly could, all in the name of the poor peasants who remained poor ""peasants"" in all but name as their leaders all the while demonized any who achieved similar power and/or wealth to their own under any guise other than ""Communism"".

The ""great socialist experiment"" was never anything more than an excuse for a few maniacal murderers (Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, etc.,) to gain power and murder on a scale unequaled by anyone other than Hitler, and for Mao to be able to fuck all the 12 year old virgins he wanted. As a political system it's a ludicrous joke. As a philosophy it's unworkable, unless you lobotomize all humans and turn them into nothing more than the bipedal equivalent of ants.

Get a grip and get a life, LeninistStalinist!!!"
