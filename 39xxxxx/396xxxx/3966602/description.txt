Drama from 1979  Rainer Werner Fassbinder  

Hanna Schygulla  Klaus LÃ¶witsch. 

 

Maria and Herma Braun get married in Germany close to the end of World War II but are shortly separated. Just after being sent to the Russian Front, Hermann is reported missing and, although Maria believes he is still alive, her brother-in-law, just returned from a POW camp in Russia, confirms Hermann's death. Alone, Maria uses her beauty and ambition to prosper in Germany's economic miracle of the 1950's. 

The Marriage of Maria Braun is a heartbreaking study of a woman picking herself up from the ruins of her own life, as well as a pointed metaphorical attack on a society determined to forget its past.
