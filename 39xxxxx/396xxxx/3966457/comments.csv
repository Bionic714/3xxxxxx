,NofinnishsubsthankU,2008-01-10T00:47Z,"Who needs nordic? Scandinavian is just fine, preferably with english subtitles. Moha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
But let's delete the finnish subs and continue to call it nordic, it's shorter than scandinavian...
Moha-ha-ha-ha....
If I could learn scandinavian so can the finnish people, but they belive finnish is a world language. That is why they speak perkel채 abroad and expect everyone to understand.
Deep inside they know that no one understands their mumbojumbo and that nobody cares. That is why they allways stick together. The Nordic gypsie people.
Do you know of any famous finnish people? Thought not..."

What a provocation.... *grins*

1) belive  --> believe
2) allways (tampon brand???? :D You are really into tampons.... :D ) --> always
3) gypsie --> gipsy / gypsy

So, learn how to write in english. *grins*
Besides, let those finns be, just learn how to write.... :D :D"
