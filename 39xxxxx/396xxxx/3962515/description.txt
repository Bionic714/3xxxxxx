--- The series ---------------------------------------------------------------

The series follows the life of anti-social, pain killer addict, witty and arrogant medical doctor Gregory House with only half a muscle in his right leg. He and his team of medical doctors try to cure very ill ordinary people in the United States of America.


--- The episode --------------------------------------------------------------

A nun arrives at the clinic with what appears to be a skin rash caused by an allergy, and starts to go into anaphylactic shock in reaction to the medication Dr. House gives her. When he then gives her an injection of epinephrine, she goes into cardiac arrest, leading Dr. Cuddy to assume that House gave her an accidental overdose. Absolutely sure that he gave the patient the correct dosage, House begins a series of unorthodox treatments to uncover the truth, and also does a bit of snooping into the sister's past.

--- Why this torrent? -------------------------------------------------------

First of all, I didn't make this file but I downloaded it from someone else. 
But with a lot of TV series and movies on this site (and others) it was zipped or 
rarred and like most of you I find that very annoying. 
So I made this torrent with the unzipped content and uploaded it here.

There will probably be more....
