,Smuggles,2008-11-25T00:44Z,"thank you, i love this movie :)"
,vegarcaek,2008-12-08T00:34Z,"dude the subs are for the hearing impared. Mind mentioning something like that? It's horrible to watch. Other than that to those who don't mind that; the quality looks good, and it's a fast download (when I DLed it anyway)."
,Symn,2010-02-13T11:39Z,pretty shitty quality for 900mb if you ask me. 
,gratefulforthis,2010-02-13T18:44Z,"Poor seeding performance unfortunately.

Will report back with scores...one day! :)"
,gratefulforthis,2010-02-13T20:11Z,Come on! Someone seed at least or remove the file :(
,gratefulforthis,2010-02-14T11:25Z,"OK...eventually came and a quick check makes the quality look very good.

I'll watch and get back to y'all :D

I had to convert the file to avi to use nero as something was corrupt."
,gratefulforthis,2010-02-15T09:57Z,"Unwatchable due to the huge subtitles.

This isn't just normal subtitles big. It's for the hard of hearing so it even has things like ""turns off music"" and ""inaudible talking"" etc etc.

bluephuz....shame on you for not explaining as this was a pathetically slow download too. 

The viewed part of the movie was a:7 v:6.5 (subs would make it 0)."
,TrthFthLv,2010-07-27T18:33Z,"awwwwwww, its not that bad. the clips are wonderful so the (music), (horn) etc etc do not act as major impediments...go ahead download this gem"
