MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. 214 Yukon Affair

214. THE YUKON AFFAIR  (12/24/1965)
Squire G. Emory Partridge returns, having acquired in Alaska a large quantity of Quadrillenium X, a very heavy metal with high magnetic powers which THRUSH wants to use to disrupt world communications. Solo and Illya are nearly killed by the local Eskimos, but are saved by the chief's daughter, Murphy. Partridge and his niece Victoria capture them, but they escape only to end up in a tavern brawl.
     Guest star: Marion Thompson (Victoria), Bernie Gozier (Headman)
