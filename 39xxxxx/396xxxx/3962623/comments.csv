Any ideas?"
,michaelshane,2008-01-30T09:21Z,Dude! I didn't know they had this movie in HD!! Thank you! I love this! :)
,Rbarba23,2008-03-31T20:42Z,"This is terrific, why is it only 2.8 gigs while other 720 releases have to be 8 and don't contain nearly as much stuff? Is it because of the audio quality?"
,f_lez,2008-05-11T05:46Z,really really spoiled by the subtitles being ripped into the video frame.
,timmybomb,2008-05-17T04:35Z,"Thanks for the upload, but this certainly doesn't look hi-def to me.  Rbarba is right, this should have a file size of at least 4.4GB.  The video plays better in Quicktime, but you can't turn off the subtitles.  The subtitles are gone in VLC, but the player tends to drop frames.  Loder has a 1080p version (8GB) available, so I'm gonna give that a try.  If you truly value hi-def, this is not for you."
,N-Asadi,2009-08-26T04:58Z,"the subtitle isn't hard coded on video
really great quality (for this size)
video:10/10
audio:10/10
thanks from Iran"
