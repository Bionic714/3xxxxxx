Rare archive film footage of Celtic Football Club during the 1960's. Featuring Jimmy Johnstone, Bobby Lennox, Willie Wallace and Bobby Murdoch.

Packed with rare archive action, this is a must for Celtic supporters of all ages.

Those glories of the early years of the Jock Stein era and the breathtaking skills of the 'Lisbon Lions' including Jimmy Johnstone, Bobby Lennonx,
Willie Wallace, Bobby Murdoch and Bertie Auld are recaptured in this unique programme.

A lasting tribute to Jock Stein and possibly the most successful group of players in the history of Scottish football.
