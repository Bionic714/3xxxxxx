,iGNiTiON_AnimE,2008-01-10T10:38Z,"I got these from paradox,
these were all i could find so dunno if there's gonna be more or these are just the first few which are made, and therefore maybe many will follow i guess we just have to wait and see. But when i can get hold on some more of these i will surely post them for you guys ;)"
