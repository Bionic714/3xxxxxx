,Mill1985,2008-01-10T07:43Z,"Hi d4mon1.

I am having problems with the how to sign my unsigned SIS file.

I have completed instructions to the best of my understanding..

At the start you say create a new map. Do you mean a ""new folder""?? thats what i've done.

secondly after opening Signsis_GUI.
it says B. Click on the dots and browse to the file HSM01_EMEInumber.cer in the map
?My HSM01 files?. Open the file.

BUT THE SIGNED FILE YOU SENT ME HAS THIS FILE AS A ""HSM01_EMEInumber.csr""???

Please help me.
My e-mail address is: badass_millad@hotmail.com

Many thanks."
