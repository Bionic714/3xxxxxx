Guys/Gals,

Happy new year to you and yours!

I have reached and exceeded the limits of my seeding capabilities, burning my PC's CPU in the process due to overheating, and I cannot remain effective in uploading and seeding simultaneously anymore.
Rest assure, the Fu will remain alive. From today onwards, I will keep posting new releases via a new referral, with direct download, at:

The remaining of today's releases are also available via the above referral.

We hope that you will come and visit us soon.
