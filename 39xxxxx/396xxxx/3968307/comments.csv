,bilupb,2008-01-26T21:04Z,"Thx liltritter for this upload! The volume 8 (Midnight on the Moon) is incomplete as it has only 2 files: #1 is 6 min 44 sec long, the #2 is 2 min and 29 sec long and ends abruptly. Would it be possible to upload this volume separately? I haven't reached the end of the album yet and will let you know if there are more probs."
