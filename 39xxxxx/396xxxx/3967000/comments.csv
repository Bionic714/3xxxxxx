,jna99,2008-06-03T19:45Z,"Thank you, thank you, thank you. This is one of my favorite shows - along with Car54 Where Are You, My Favorite Martian, Phil Silvers Show, and other great oldies. Please upload all you can. And thanks so much for sharing these shows with us.

Just wondering - did you get them from the many websites that sell DVDs with shows taped from TV Land ? Those are the only places I can find how to get these shows. Thanks again."
