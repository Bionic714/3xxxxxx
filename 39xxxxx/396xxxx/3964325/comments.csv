You can also mount the .dmg and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to the destination of your choosing, and watch it with your apple DVD Player.

All the best!

,derweiner,2008-01-07T05:31Z,Or you can go to the website and see this dud tutorial without downloading it.
,RipMaster,2008-01-07T12:08Z,"Thank you derweiner, you are right :)
I am uploading this DVD, as the quality and size of the video is much better for freezing, scrolling back and forth, etc."
,tomh2o,2008-01-09T04:17Z,"this torrent has been up for 2 days and still one seeder nice try loser
delete this crap
its crap this this that will kill the site"
,RipMaster,2008-01-09T22:57Z,"So let me get this straight tomh20,
You have something others might be interested in, you make a torrent and uploaded it, and LEAVE it up for people until there may possibly be other seeders.......and all of a sudden someone is a loser?

Your an idiot."
,Pettjerk,2008-01-10T00:48Z,"tomh2o, have you just started to explore the world of torrents and now, just because you have learned something, you have to act like an idiot?
Should it not be a age limit fore using this site? Put it at least over 12."
,RipMaster,2008-01-10T03:03Z,"Thanks Pettjerk,
It is people like you that just appreciate we are all getting something for free, that makes others like us continue to upload :)

All the best!"
,midtownhog,2008-01-19T10:55Z,"are these the tutorials that are posted on the apple.com or are they from a different site? 
thanx"
,Mac_Conqueror,2008-04-17T21:06Z,how can i view them online as said previously....what is the site
,kacuchurros,2008-05-05T07:07Z,"Please... Seed!
I'm realy in need of this file ...I'm almost completing the download and I shall seed it for a long time.
Makes no sense to keep the torrent active if people aren't willing to seed"
,Silent_G20,2008-05-27T05:53Z,"@RipMaster
Great job! i was looking around for a long time for these tutorials. I really appreciate ur work RipMaster, please keep seeding :)
if i may ask, are these only videos no training files like those from lynda's? and whats the difference between these videos in this torrent and the ones on apple's website?"
,Ooops2,2008-10-30T01:37Z,"This tutorials is useless. You wonÂ´t learn nothing.

Very heavy to download. I spent a lot of time for nothing."
,bigjohnny002,2009-01-24T02:36Z,"oooh gimme gimme gimme. thx RipMaster, big file but i'm willing to wait."
,bigjohnny002,2009-01-25T14:48Z,"It only took me about 2 and a half days to dl but you what, its worth it. i just getting into the field of video editing and this tutorial is an excellent place to start. i didnt burn in on a dvd. i have a macbook pro and i just mount it and executed my dvd player and it automatic played it. a-10/v-10 and info-10+ for those who are just starting to get into the field like me. THX RipMaster"
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2009-06-04T05:52Z,Thanks. I don't own a Mac yet but the Mac does have some good software out there so I will have to buy one eventually just so I can use this software.
,sastramaya,2009-11-24T16:28Z,it quite clearly state you need to use a dual layer dvd
