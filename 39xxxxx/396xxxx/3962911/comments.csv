,sfmystic,2010-05-09T23:37Z,"Files are corrupted!! My repair program can't fix. This torrent should be deleted by HVLINT, repacked and a new seeding initiated."
,hvlint,2010-05-11T18:33Z,for more than 2 years everybody is downloading and happy and you claim it's corrupted. Maybe you need to change you're codec like cyclops_9 two years ago
