[T],kirklestat,2008-01-23T00:41Z,RIP to Heath Ledger. too bad he'd be the next Joker for the next Batman Movie.
,Movie_Critic,2008-01-23T06:05Z,"You're right ""kirklestat"" - RIP to Heath. He really was a good actor and he looked terrific in the teaser trailor as the Joker. 

Thanks for seeding the film. I am just about to start the DL. "
,explodinghearts77,2008-01-24T03:56Z,Ive been watching this movie in history class...It's great so I figured I might as well DL...And it is sad that Ledger died at such a young age. He had a lot of stuff ahead of him. 
,Vorperblad,2008-01-26T14:43Z,"Thanx Kirklestat. Good quality & great story. Two of the finest actors in Australia. Mel Gibson & Heath Ledger. This one W/OUT the TV ads. I will enjoy & add to my collection.

Seedin' 'til Wheneva."
[T],kirklestat,2008-01-29T05:50Z,you are welcome
,Hugocraft,2008-02-22T18:04Z,"I found it interesting to read the ""Controversy"" section about this file on it's wikipedia page picking apart the movie.  I haven't seen this film since 01 in high school and I'll watch as soon as its done.  Then I'll have a better idea if the controversy ideas hold up."
,cdub_connor,2008-03-02T19:49Z,"I downloaded this and I wanted to watch it, but only the audio would play, the video wouldn't. Has anyone else had this problem?"
[T],kirklestat,2008-03-03T03:04Z,use VLC Media Player. it should play. 
,Ziniac,2008-03-17T09:03Z,"plz stop whining about Heath Ledger being the next joker.. of course its sad that he has past away.. but wasnt it his own choice to play the joker.. dont think any actor needs to defend the roles they want to play..
we just have to hope for that he plays the joker just as good as he played his other roles..
