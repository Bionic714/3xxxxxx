The one chord wonders of Punk music The Adverts. With a smashing hit Gary Gilmore's Eyes they had everything in front of them. Unfortunately they broke up after only two records. Here are all studio releases by them. The John Peel session is not included here sense all the songs in original take is included on both Crossing the Red See and Singles collection.
