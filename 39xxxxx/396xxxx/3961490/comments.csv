,ceguard,2008-05-01T05:00Z,"I downloaded this movie. It is excellant-excellant video and excellant audio. I really like tha fact that it works just like that the menu acts just like a regular DVD-fully interactive after I burnt it to disc. The only drawbsck and I don't know why is that it will play in my computer-where I have Toshiba/Pioneer DVD player software which is picky and wont play anything else I burn unless it is in this format. But when I try to play it in my actual Toshiba progressive scan DVD player, which plays almost anything gives me tha following message Disc Error-not NTSC. So I don't know what is up with that. But the movie itself is great-Alternate beginning, outtakes the whole nine yards, works great.
Thanks skafa-great movie"
