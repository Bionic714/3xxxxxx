Choo Thomas tells a remarkable story of her encounters with Jesus Christ, where she visited heaven many times and saw hell twice.

Her book, \"Heaven is so Real\" is more than just a book - it is Christ\'s loving message to a generation that has largely forgotten, misunderstood or is indifferent about Him.

This book will touch your heart and soul and will challenge you to live a life of obedience and purity like you have never done before.
