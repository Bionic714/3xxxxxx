Clay Walker's first album for Curb Records, FALL is a rootsy return to the hard country sound of his mid-1990s debut. Produced by new-traditionalist mainstay Keith Stegall, best known for his work with Alan Jackson, FALL is a crisp, unadorned record filled with twangy guitar-driven country tunes with few pop tendencies. Similarly, Walker (who wrote more than half the album himself) sticks to his roots with fine pure-country tunes like the sly "'Fore She Was Mama" and the blue-collar anthem "Workin' Man."
