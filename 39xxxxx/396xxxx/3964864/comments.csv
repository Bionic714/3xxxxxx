,madmax999,2008-01-07T16:44Z,Its running now. You shouldn't have any problems. It took a while to update the tracker.

Thank you"

,madmax999,2008-03-24T22:51Z,"It has both english and italian.  There are two audio streams.  You should be able to right click on the screen and choose Audio, then select the audio stream that you want.  There are a number of players that support this. MS Windows Media Player does not seem to.  You can download a player such as Media Player Classic that does from Downloads.com.

Let me know if you are having any other problems."
