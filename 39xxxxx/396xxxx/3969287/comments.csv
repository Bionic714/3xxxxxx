2ndly - zips are sometimes just used to keep multiple files grouped, for eg. say a program or games generally have multiple files for installation as a zip they are packaged together which can also as far as torrents go keep the torrent healthy because if people are just picking bits and pieces out of torrents sooner or later your going to get those annoying torrents that many people are leeching but are stuck at a certain percentage because they have been picked apart & the rest left to rott so to speak - (parts of the puzzle gone) the torrent wont self sustain that way.
3rdly u might find some compressed files more prominantly rar type format which have many smaller equally sized files (compressed) - i believe that style was initally developed for or used in the early days for dialup use in downloading video + other as dialup was non resumable for downloads & i think the smaller chunks/packets are perhaps more managable under certain protocols."
