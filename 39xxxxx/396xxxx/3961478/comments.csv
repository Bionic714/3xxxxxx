,Cicer0,2008-01-25T04:17Z,"""The Game.avi"" wtf? Where's my Kubrick Classic? Is this real? Anyone?"
[T],JayRay,2008-01-25T05:36Z,"CicerO: 

This is the Classic Lolita. 

I hadn't noticed, until you brought it up, that I had the wrong name on the .avi file. That was the name of the movie I ripped right before this and I forgot to change the name in the output setting.  But the movie is real and great quality. 

Thanks!
JayRay"

I has lost it."
,skydiverQ,2008-12-15T13:52Z,"FYI, if anyone is interested, this is the British/Australian cut of the film.  Very minor differences from the US release, but I just wanted to let people know.

Excellent rip, excellent movie."
,swemextheone,2009-01-13T01:55Z,what is the difference between the australia/english and the usa??
,mdkhrsh,2009-01-13T16:18Z,"super movie, thanks"
,hughl,2009-08-10T06:28Z,This is a great rip but unfortunately the aspect ratio is slightly off; playing the file in something like VLC or Media Player Classic and setting the AR to 16:9 corrects the problem.
,Kvnt,2009-09-15T10:38Z,Seed seed. Nice torrent.
,coltron0,2009-12-23T17:38Z,You are now breathing manually.
,Guy Paradise,2010-01-16T13:08Z,well played sir.
,axo666,2011-02-18T19:14Z,"Difference between US and UK/Australia version:
The scene where Lolita first ""seduces"" Humbert as he lies on the cot is approximately 10 seconds longer in the British and Australian cut of the film. In the U.S. edition, the shot fades as she whispers the details of the ""game"" she played with Charlie at camp. In the UK/Australian print, the shot continues as Humbert mumbles that he's not familiar with the game. She then bends down again to whisper more details. Kubrick then cuts to a closer shot of Lolita's face as she says ""Well, alrighty then"" and then fades as she begins to descend onto Humbert on the cot. (from wikipedia)
This makes this the uncut version, i guess."
