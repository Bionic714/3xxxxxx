  The End Of The World As We Know It

  "Global warming is the biggest problem facing us this century - 
bigger even than the problems of global terrorism" Sir David King, 
chief scientific advisor to the British Government.

  In The End of the World as We Know It, presenter and writer Marcel 
Theroux crosses the globe talking to everyone he can who might 
provide the answer to his key question: are we about to destroy 
ourselves and our planet?

  Described by the UK's The Guardian as "Excellent" and "Terrifying" 
by The Observer, this unflinching documentary follows as Theroux, a 
self-confessed layman when it comes to scientific matters, travels 
to Chernobyl"s reactor #4 and its nearby abandoned town of Pripiet, 
described as a "nuclear Pompeii"; Alaska - the most rapidly-warming 
place on the planet; and also West Bengal in India where whole towns 
are decimated as the sea level rises; to talk to experts and 
discover horrifying facts about global warming and the estimated 
future of our planet.

  The icecaps are thinning, the forests are dying, the sea levels are 
rising and the Gulf Stream is slowing. As Theroux travels through 
the weird and scary world of climate change, he talks to 
environmentalists, scientists and economists - including the previous 
Chairman of the British arm of the oil company Shell, Lord Ron 
Oxburgh - and meets people who have already had a taste of what 
global warming has in store for us all. This pertinent documentary 
explores how the threats posed by climate change call for a radical 
re-thinking of our priorities.

  To save the planet, scientists say we need to slash carbon dioxide 
emissions by at least 60% which leads Theroux to the unthinkable 
conclusion: that nuclear power may be the way to avert catastrophe 
as for all other avenues - like carbon sequestration or turbine 
power - it would seem that Earth has run out of time.
