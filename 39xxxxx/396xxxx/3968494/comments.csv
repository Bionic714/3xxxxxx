does anyone have their First or Second?"
,Falleen_Fan_No_1,2008-03-08T15:06Z,Great southern melodic metal.  Download worked fine.  Highly recommend!
,Mixmaster456,2008-03-31T22:19Z,I have the first and second albums in mp3 format only. Let me know if you want me to upload those.
,the.end.is.nigh-pod,2008-03-31T23:59Z,how does one listen to the files once downloaded? help?!
,ferret09,2008-04-22T00:30Z,that would be sweet if you would upload those
,burningrabbit,2009-11-26T03:54Z,"How about some of their mates' bands, like Kylesa and Blacktusk? I hear they're just as tough..."
,badco970,2010-05-10T01:00Z,An mp3 version of this would be greatly appreciated. FLAC takes too long to down load and i want this CD for my ipod.
