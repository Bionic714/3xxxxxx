,jesdaking,2008-01-10T12:25Z,"For all people having troubles: 

Step by Step Guide: 

1: Download file off Rapidshare or off the Japanese sony site 
2: Get a form of portable media (SD card, Flash drive, USB memory stick) 
3: Create a new folder on the memory stick called PS3 
4: Then create a new folder inside the PS3 folder called THEMES 
+++ If you downloaded from r/share the folders will already be created++ 
5: Place the theme files that you downloaded inside the THEMES folder 
Folder should look like this: Memory stick-->PS3-->THEMES-->""theme file"" 
6: Insert memory stick into PS3 
7: select themes from the XMB 
8: At the top select ""install"" 
9: Select the theme to install and click ok 
Repeat steps 8 + 9 for each theme."

To insatll these themes, you must:
Create a folder called PS3->THEME-> then the themes...
Make sure the folders names are with big letters..."

,jmc61649,2010-02-10T07:27Z,lol got it thanks heaps for the upload
,SMIM,2010-02-23T16:42Z,"the problem is cause you are not supposed to make the THEME folder with an 'S' on the end. it should go:

PS3>THEME>add your themes

not

PS3>THEMES>add your themes


a simple typo can fuck with 45 minutes of your time."
,vnfsf,2010-03-23T21:44Z,Also since no one mentioned it. Make sure you flash drive or whatever is formatted to FAT32. Then the rest of the instructions here will work.
,Maggot101,2010-05-31T06:57Z,I did it like this PS3- THEMES- then theme files. still it says there are no themes. what did i do wrong? 
,Maggot101,2010-05-31T06:59Z,"Oh never mind, I got it lol. "
,patthooe1,2011-01-15T04:54Z,seed please :)
,fugov1,2012-04-13T17:12Z,"Ok guys, the first thing you need to do is to format your SD card, Memory Stick, whatever to FAT or FAT32 format, the PS3 doesn't use the NTFS (NTSF?) system that computers use today. Try doing that and then the rest of the steps for installation."
