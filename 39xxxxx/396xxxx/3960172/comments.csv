,ablancacco,2010-04-29T01:44Z,"My friend, check your drive, DVD-R or your software. This files are perfect to burn.
Check your DVD Player too.

Tks!"
,strongboy2,2010-04-29T17:09Z,"Hi! thanks for your answer. I did everything you suggested. Still nothing. I bought the original dvd's but guess what? Disc one doesn't play either! Weird eh? Disc 2 plays perfect but I haven't checked your file no.2 
I have to download that one again because now I am so curious if that one works and I will let you know!. Kiss rocks!

,strongboy2,2010-04-29T17:12Z,I have to add: download and original disc one do not play on computer or standalone dvdplayers. Both go in overdrive and I had to restart player and computer.
