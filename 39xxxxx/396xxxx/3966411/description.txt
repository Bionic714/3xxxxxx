Note from the ripper: 
Hello everyone. I`ve noticed that a lot of good movies have slipped through the cracks of the ripping community. Some movies are no where to be found. If you are an avid movie collector, like myself, than you know exactly what I`m talking about. I am dedicated to bringing you all the good movies that you just can`t seem to find, so you can fill those unseemly holes in your collection.

John Rambo is a disoriented Vietnam Vet. He is hitchhiking from town to town to see friends from the war. A sheriff tries to make him leave town and when he refuses, arrests him for vagrancy. While in jail, a deputy takes delight in abusing him. Rambo escapes showing his old Vietnam fighting skills and takes to the woods as the sheriff and deputies try and find him in his element. Things get out of hand as Colonel Trautman Rambo\'s old commander appears to shed light on the situation.
