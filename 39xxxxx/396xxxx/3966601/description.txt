_____________________________________________________________Summary__

When East Timorese grabbed their independence and, with the help of 
Australian-led forces, withstood the murderous onslaught of 
Indonesia-backed militiamen, the world saluted their courage.
A new nation was born, dirt-poor but filled with hope and optimism.

Seven years on, the Australian soldiers are back, trying to stop more 
bloodshed. Again, thousands of terrified East Timorese have become 
refugees. Lives have been taken and properties burnt and trashed, 
in fewer numbers this time. Now Xanana Gusmao walks in pain and 
weeps with his people.

The tiny country?s convulsions have given rise to an uncomfortable 
notion, that it could be lurching towards failed statehood, that 
the bold independence journey might derail into civil war. But the 
key question of East Timor?s future is bound inextricably to the 
present: What ? who ? is causing the present turmoil?

Four Corners looks for an answer by peeling back the layers of this 
multi-tiered conflict that pits soldier against policeman, easterner 
against westerner and prime minister against president.

Reporter Liz Jackson reports from East Timor?s capital Dili and the 
outlying mountains, tapping into the secret agendas and shifting 
alliances of key players and showing how their power struggles are 
grinding down an already traumatised people.

Jackson broke the recent story of the claims by former Falintil 
fighters that they had been hired by Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri 
to kill and intimidate opponents ? an allegation denied by Alkatiri.
This report will also break news as well as providing insight into 
the evolving tragedy of East Timor.
