Even though you aren't getting many comments (or ""thank you""s) there are quite a few people downloading so they are definitely enjoying them.

Thank you from me (and my wife) and please keep uploading them.

Would you mind jumping back on episodes 104 and 107 of 77 Sunset Strip to get them seeded?  They are both stuck on 99% or so and their are about 10 peers on each.  I am keeping all the ""77"" torrents alive so if you were to do this much appreciated favour, I could keep ALL the ""77"" torrents alive for a long time to come.

Sincerely,

HQH.
