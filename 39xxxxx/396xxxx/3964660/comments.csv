,thasro,2008-01-07T06:38Z,The earlier released crack worked just fine. To get it to work on Leopard you just needed to download iPatch and integrate it with the crack.
,KingYaba,2008-01-08T06:27Z,If you have v1.0 it will work however any other previous version look elsewhere.
,KingYaba,2008-01-08T06:28Z,Or any other version such as .2 and .3 it will not work.
,Klepzeiker13,2008-01-08T15:21Z,"It works fine for me.

Thanks.

P.S.
When you installed the patch, can you upgrade to 1.1 1.2 or 1.3 ?"
,KingYaba,2008-01-13T06:56Z,"Enlighten us, Klepzeiker13, as to how this works ""fine"" for you? "
,mc0025,2008-01-13T07:44Z,"SUCCESS!
Its easy, it works perfect on leopard, just follow instructions. TY TY TY! I was waiting for weeks for a leopard crack to be released!"
,bleachxfan,2008-01-13T20:28Z,I unzipped the file and all I got was a .app so then I double clicked it and ipatcher came up. I proceeded to select the .app then it said it couldn't apply the patch! What's going on here? I never got the .dmg!!
,bleachxfan,2008-01-13T20:39Z,It will crash when I open it!!
,grizzlafist,2008-01-14T20:19Z,which crack-program is the best?

,HolyKiwi,2008-01-18T21:36Z,"I have a problem..

Anyways, I've found a way to update to 1.03 so you're able to use the multiplayer under Leopard.
It patches the Out of Sync error:

,dabradster,2008-08-10T18:03Z,"Does this work with any age of empires torrent? If someone could eplain how to get it working on os x  without a cd, that would be awesome and I will seed aoe for a long time. Please reply!"
,manfat2000,2008-08-20T12:53Z,"I can confirm this worked for me using version 1.0 but NOT later updated version 1.0.4. Also, I found that you don't need a crack if you just burn the install image and put the disk in the drive! There seems to be no copy protection for this game. There is also a NODVD.toast image which is 2MB and when mounted using toast it emulates having the 2GB DVD in the drive and works with all versions ..."
,bobbarker69,2008-11-28T17:06Z,"I think I'm doing this wrong...the game still says I need the disk. The info on the torrent isn't helping me, so I was wondering if anyone could walk me though hooking up the crack. "
,Newblit,2009-01-05T21:31Z,Can someone paste the link for the toast software I can't find it I have looked high and low and no luck.
,sk8fast,2009-04-04T09:48Z,dang nice job with the seeding it took like 3 seconds to download but when i tried to pattch the file it said that the file couldent be patched help would e good
,l3viathan,2009-04-29T00:40Z,Use the crack at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4767772/Age_of_Empires_III_1.04_NoCd_Patch.zip after updating to version 1.04.  (See my detailed instructions in the comments for that torrent.)
,faforce,2009-06-16T04:35Z,"Any way to get this to work on GameRanger, for online game?

I get error message saying version mismatch, or crc mismatch.

Help would be appreciated."
,lolfactor,2009-06-24T13:24Z,"Good job, worked perfectly!"
,AOE3BESTEVER,2009-12-18T22:21Z,"***ATTENTION!***

NO MORE CRACKS ARE NEEDED!!

Step 1: Install AOE3

Step 2: Update AOE3 to the latest patch (1.05) heres the link 
http://destineergames.com/support/?page_id=88

Its that easy!

Now Age of Empire 3 should even work online, no crack needed because the 1.05 update removes the cd check, just download Gameranger create a free account and your good to go.

Hope this helps. If you still cant get Age of Empires III to work then its because you failed to follow my simple steps. These same steps work for the expansion packs aswell, all you have to do if find the torrent for them, download them and install all the updates found it the link above."
,fictionalMe,2010-09-23T00:09Z,"don't get me wrong, this was a great crack when it was needed. But now this game has no copyright protection whatso ever.
As AOE3BESTEVER said:
http://destineergames.com/support/?page_id=88

Download and install and there wll be no need for a crack, plus online version shows no errors"
,LilPoke,2011-09-29T05:33Z,I don't get how you update it. :S
