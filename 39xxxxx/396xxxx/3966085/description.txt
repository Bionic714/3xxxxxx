Katt Williams may not be tall - he claims to be 5-foot-5 in this outrageous stand-up comedy special - but he packs a lot of laughs per square inch. From his stylin' threads through his provocative, tell-it-like-it-is monologue, Williams aims to provoke with this one-man show. Rapper Snoop Dogg, seen giving Williams a pre-show pep talk while indulging in a blunt, invokes the names of Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor as influences and inspirations for Williams' comedy. Just as Pryor used both the "N" word and a certain 12-letter obscenity until they sounded like urban poetry, so does Williams, even as he scores points about everything from black-white relations to his anger at the way black people excuse the behavior of both Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston. The man's got something to say - and a funny way of saying it.
