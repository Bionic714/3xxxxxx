,Sascrunch,2008-03-31T07:34Z,"I downloaded this torrent, but I'm having trouble with the second file (02 - Day of Armageddon).  Every time I play it, I get a message telling me that the file contains multiple audio tracks.  From that point on, I get no video and sporadic audio.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Any suggestions for a fix?"
