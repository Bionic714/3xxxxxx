,ilive4harleys,2008-01-31T08:47Z,"stilljacktwenty  your statement is an understatement. He is one of the best. He, for some reason, just did not catch on big. He did write alot of great tunes. He wrote World You Lay With me recorded by Tanya Tucker. He spent time in an Ohio prison and lived in a hearse. If you have anymore, please upload. Or Gene Watson.
Anyway, thank you for this wonderful upload. This upload may just Give Mona Lisa Back Her Smile  :-)"
