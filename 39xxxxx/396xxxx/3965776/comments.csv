Only a comment about the aspect ratio of this transfer: it's letterboxed, not anamorphic, so it will play windowed in the center of the screen if played on a widescreen tv."
,silicone1990,2008-02-01T07:24Z,anyone know how to burn this to a dvd on a mac that will play in a video dvd player?
,walterfive,2008-02-29T18:31Z,"A MILLION f*ckin' thanks, man! This will surely beat the Hel out of the Sony VX-515 DVD dub of my 20+ year old VCR release of this film! 

One of the strangest movies ever made, this. It's almost like Ringo's presence in a film doomed it obscurity in the 70's... ""200 Motels""... ""Blindman""... Harry Nillson's ""Son Of Dracula""... ""Born To Boogie"" ...""Sextette.""

I never knew this came out on Laserdisc... I bought into that format back in 1984..."

THANXXXXX"
