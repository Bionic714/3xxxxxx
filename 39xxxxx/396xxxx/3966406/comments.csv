,away_doom,2009-01-27T20:07Z,"how can i get it to play on my dvd?
I bought a DVD9 but Nero says some files cant be add to because they're not dvd compatible files (it happens to be the ones with MENU in their names). Also Nero gives a message saying i have to choose udf type because there's a file of 7,2 gb.
How can i get this to burn properly and play on my dvd?"
