[T],killerdemon,2008-01-19T20:44Z,"Nope, it's just small encoded, but fine whatchable quality, i have it as my own collection :)"

[T],killerdemon,2008-04-06T03:31Z,"fendu, do you have a codec installed?"
,beautifuldeath,2008-05-22T08:45Z,what codec should i download? (i can't play it)
,beautifuldeath,2008-05-22T18:31Z,"for anyone who can't play the files, you need the div3 codec (if you don't have it). you can download it at http://www.divxmovies.com/codec/
it doesn't seem to work for quicktime, but it works for windows media player"
[T],killerdemon,2008-06-10T19:48Z,try VLC ^^
,Dj_Max-It,2008-06-28T16:10Z,Fendu is an idiot. It works. I have this season. And the rest as well. But I want better quality than this. Around 175 mb / episode. Anyone know where I can find it? I have all the other 18 seasons in great quality.

Try to search for the Magic Video Converter or an equivalent here on TPB, Magic Video Converter can covert almost all video files to other types. Good Luck"
