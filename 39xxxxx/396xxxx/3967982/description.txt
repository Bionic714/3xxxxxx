This is Patrolling with Sean Kennedy Season 1 episodes 1 - 11 encoded in DivX for viewing on any device that uses a 320x212 display.

The viewer I use to watch these on my iPaq is The Core Pocket Media Player, but there are other players available.

To create your own Pocket Divx movies, I use Pocket Divx Encoder, which can also be used for other devices.
