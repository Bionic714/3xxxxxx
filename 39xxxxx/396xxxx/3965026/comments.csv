After you finish to download 100%, extract the bouth files from rar archives, .mp4, and .thmm and rename the files MAQ20011.mp4 and MAQ20011.thm. U have to create a new folder inside the MP_ROOT named 100ANV01, and have to move the to renamed files here.
/MP_ROOT/100ANV01/MAQ20011.MP4
/MP_ROOT/100ANV01/MAQ20011.THM
In this order and format will work 100%, tested by myself, sorry about this, I just see it today.
