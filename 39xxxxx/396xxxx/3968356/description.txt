THE STEPFORD WIVES - 1975

  The Original.

  Katharine Ross stars as a city woman who moves with her husband to Stepford and is startled by how perpetually happy many of the local women seem to be. Her search for an answer reveals a plot to replace troublesome real wives with more accommodating fake ones. The closer she gets to the truth, the more danger she faces--not to mention the likelihood that the men in town intend to replace her as well. This film is so much better than the 2004 comic remake with Nicole Kiddman.
