I saw that you have uploaded Masterboy, Ice MC..... Great songs, but have you ever heard about Dr. Alban - I Need You More? or Yaki - Da - Teaser On The Catwalk, Pride Of Africa, Real McCoy - Hey Now? If you did, can you tell me where to find them? And there is one more song, I dont't know who is performing, but sounds like a reggae - rap from 90, and the refrain is ""You Make Me Come Alive"" Sooooper songs!!! Please send me a message at yonootzb@yahoo.co.uk"
