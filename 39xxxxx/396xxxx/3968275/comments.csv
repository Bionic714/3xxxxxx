,djaugust,2008-01-09T20:26Z,"I think you should be thankful for the upload & scan, instead of complaining, jcd.
Thanx for the share!"
,NailZ,2008-01-09T20:39Z,"Dont yell at JCD - ya gotta realize we have been use to getting our comics, all of them by 2pm EST on wed for the past 2 years. =)"
,djaugust,2008-01-09T22:56Z,"no yelling was involved. 
I loved to get 0-day comics as well. But as things stand , I'm happy we get comics at all...

peace"
,NailZ,2008-01-10T00:40Z,Ya know what DJ.... yer absolutely right.  Keep the dream alive!
,timewilltell,2008-01-10T18:13Z,"jcd281, the Minutemen and DCP are different groups and both do things differently as well.  If you don't like the MM scans, go get DCPs.  No one is forcing to like this stuff if you don't.
It's a matter of flavors after all.  You're entitled to have your own favorites."
[T],Sakrilege,2008-01-11T06:04Z,"erm, well, let me just say, the MM is not competing with DCP so beating the MM to the punch is just silly. The MM, for the most part will always be a week behind."
,timewilltell,2008-01-17T00:46Z,"Countdown is a little late, but it will continue.  You have my word on it ;)."
,maxdeath,2008-01-22T16:19Z,thanks for this.
