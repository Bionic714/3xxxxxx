,l2oXXol2,2008-01-08T05:53Z,"i've been seeding since release...so if you are having issues please consult www.portforward.com or your application used for downloading (uTorrent, Azureus, Comet, ect)...if not perhaps thepiratebay.org was suffering for a little while...Enjoy and thanks for the helpful comment"
,brunoborjes,2008-01-21T17:58Z,"I CANNOT OPEN THESE ARCHIVES, AS I OPEN THEM SINCE THERE IS FILE CUE. I HAVE TRIED WITH NERO And WITH CDWRITE And I CANNOT.
SINCE I DO TO HIM?"
,l2oXXol2,2008-01-22T13:18Z,"hello brunoborjes, these are merely the rom files, you'll need an emulator for the OS you are using...a simple google search returns: Windows XP - > http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=g0S&q=sega+emulator+windows+xp&btnG=Search
you don't burn them though you play them with an emulator enjoy"

,aussie4life,2008-05-29T18:41Z,Theme Park doesnt work for me.
,VileCore,2008-06-01T21:57Z,"Something to generally bear in mind when dealing with emulation: Some ROMS will not work with some emulators. It's just the way it is. To take the time to write a complaint because one ROM out of 948 doesn't work for you? Thanks, man, I needed cheering up. Idiot."
,VileCore,2008-06-01T21:58Z,"Oh, "
,VileCore,2008-06-01T21:58Z,"Oh, and play Chakan. It's somewhat fun."

,bottle90gt,2008-07-27T19:07Z,"phoenix_red1988, X-men and X-men 2 are in this download. The uploader must have run out of space. As you may notice, the list stops at the W's. When you go to download it, you can see the rest of them in the list of files in your torrent software."

,Consoli,2008-08-14T19:24Z,"Thanks for the roms, but what is the file ""delete.me"" for?"

,MaxPwnz,2008-09-18T00:47Z,"i downloaded this emulator, http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/genesis/gens32.html will it work with these roms?"
