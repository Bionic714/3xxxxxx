The Jan and Dean Meet Batman is a concept album with its tongue planted firmly in its cheek. If you're a fan of the old TV show, you'll enjoy the campy and corny jokes here. (AMG)
This is also Jan Berry's last full Lp before his near death car crash.
Stereo versions are hard to find, the Mono is near impossible.
Very Rare.
