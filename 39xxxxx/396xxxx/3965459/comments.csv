,DemonsDog,2009-01-09T20:22Z,"Hey Kineraxn, Deuchebag, some people would much prefer this to be compressed, and this wouldn't take double space to do so

1 - The compressed videos won't be the same size

2 - some people, mighn't have enough space left  on their hard drive.

3 - people will have a choice between the compressed or high quality version

4 - You suck

Can someone who has already downloaded this, please upload a compressed version for those wanting it

Also, this has way too many leechs, that is why it is slow, it will take ages before the leeches lower"

Just delete ""xvid"" from the name and put ""avi"" in it's place. Works fine after that. "

,xiIix,2010-09-08T21:43Z,"@Kanano, that doesn't ""convert"" anything, it simply changes the extension name, which simply changes what filters will decode it, because certain filters are associated to certain containers.
