What?:
Rock that 8-bit shit!  Yeah, play Nintendo without dealing with carts and other problems with ancient hardware.  Some people complain that this isn't "pure," because it's not the original hardware.  Let me tell you, spend one hour playing with this and you'll forget all about that.  

This is an image of a self-booting NesterDC 6 disc, for which I made my own menu screens.  I think this has all the games you could want (except RPGs cause I don't play those :P )  I played every god damn stupid ROM I could find and kept only the English ones that worked and had at least something interesting or fun about them (however small).  Actually there's a couple Japanese games in there, but only ones that don't rely on reading so much as to be unplayable if you can't read Japanese.

Games:
There are 330 ROMs on this.  The titles that start with _ are homebrew and demo ROMs.  NES_TEST was a diagnostic cartridge used by Nintendo technicians; _NES_TEST is a homebrew diagnostic.  You won't need them for the DC, but they're historically interesting.  Mario Adventure is homebrew, but it's good enough and complete enough to go in there with the other games, really amazing.  Some of my favorite games that you might not be familiar with: Lickle, Klax (awesome music!), Holy Diver, Rolling Thunder, and the best version of Defender ever made.  Arcade ports in general on the NES were the best, most perfect ports ever, imo (Except Donkey Kong. grrrrr)  Other than Mario Adventure, there are no hacks included.  Hacks are usually dumb.  The most interesting hack I've found (besides Mario Forever) was SMB1 with 2600 graphics, but the hacker was lazy and did not convert every sprite, so I was disappointed.

If there is a game you want to play that's not on this disc, find the ROM, and burn a CD with the ROM in a folder called games, then put that CD in your DC after booting to the menu screen.

Emulation:
This is the best NES emulator there is.  The graphics and sound are *_perfect_*.  If you're playing Nintendo on a computer, you're missing out.  Controller in your hands, in front of a TV set...it's worth it to snag a Dreamcast on eBay just for this.

About the controls:
If you're using the DC controller, Y is Select.  Press L+R+Start to return to the menu.  Use the D-pad.  The joystick changes the speed (It's fun when your friends don't know this and they suddenly double the speed of the game accidentally.)  Press R+Y to enter the state save/load menu (people also tend to do this accidentally.  Keep your damn fingers away from the triggers!)  On the menu screen, down is line down and right is page down.  

I bet there's an adapter somewhere out there you could get to use an original NES controller with.  This would really complete the experience.  If you can find one of those, let me know... I left out Duck Hunt, Gyromite, Hogan's Alley, etc. because they need other peripherals, and you'd need such a thing to connect a Zapper or R.O.B.

OK, anyway, I've rambled way WAY too much here...have fun ya bastards!
