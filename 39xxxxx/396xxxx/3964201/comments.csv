,valleysky,2008-01-12T03:06Z,"Downloaded and burned the image to DVD+RW using DVD Decrypter. When I insert the disc into my Nav module my Comand display reports ""No DVD. Please insert a Nav DVD.""

Has anyone else had trouble with this disc? I have burned the DVD twice. Still no luck.

I have a 2005 E320 amd am currently using a 2004.2 NAV DVD.

To rule out the possibility that I am using an incompatible DVD or that my burning settings were bad, I made a duplicate copy of my 2004.2 DVD using the same disc type and burning procedure that I used for the 2006.2 DVD. My Nav module has no problem reading my copied 2004.2 DVD.

Any ideas???"
,sgaar,2008-01-13T02:23Z,You need to update the firmware in your COMAND system to use this disk. I know the process work as I am using it in my car.
