Rock that 8-bit shit!  Yeah, play Nintendo without dealing with carts and other problems with ancient hardware.  Some people complain that this isn't "pure," because it's not the original hardware.  Let me tell you, spend one hour playing with this and you'll forget all about that.  

This is an image of a self-booting NesterDC 6 disc, for which I made my own menu screens.  I think this has all the games you could want (except RPGs cause I don't play those :P )  I played every god damn stupid ROM I could find and kept only the playable ones.

330 ROMs, list in my older post here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3963679/Nintendo_for_Dreamcast____emulator
I decided to compress the image for much faster goodness!  This is less than half the size of the previous download.
