Release Notes:
--------
"I just write songs and however they come out is how it happens," explains
former Test Icicle Dev Hynes when quizzed about his latest incarnation
Lightspeed Champion. A huge departure from the ear-shattering noise of his
previous band, Dev's new material is heavily influenced by the laidback
surroundings of the Nebraska studio where it was recorded. Produced by Saddle
Creek Records' resident knob-twiddler Mike Mogis, Dev's debut solo album Falling
Off The Lavender Bridge promises to be an earthy, acoustic adventure.

"I was living in this weird house in the middle of Omaha," explains Dev. "It was
great. I love the Midwest. I feel so at ease and the atmosphere is so relaxed,
which is exactly what I wanted for this record." Lead single 'Galaxy of the
Lost' encapsulates that feeling beautifully. Beach Boys harmonies and chiming
country-rock guitars provide the perfect backdrop for Dev's quintessentially
indie-ish vocals.

"I wrote a lot of the songs about two years ago, or within that time," Dev
continues. "The last one on the album I wrote whilst in Omaha but I demoed
around fifty songs originally and then it got whittled down to these eleven?
Shit, I don't even know. I think it's ten actually." Clearly a prolific
songwriter, Dev Hynes will happily turn his talents to most genres. Lightspeed
Champion is simply the outlet for his more pastoral work and not a complete
turnaround. "Lately I've wrote a group of quite rock-based songs and some
hip-hop/R&B songs," he reveals. "Buy yeah, for this albums these songs seemed to
fit together, so that's what I recorded."

Taking its name from Dev's childhood attempts at dream control, the eagerly
anticipated Falling Off The Lavender Bridge LP looks set to become a classic,
coming as it does from one of our most intriguing contemporary artists. "I used
to be able to send myself into the same dream every night if I concentrated hard
enough," Dev explains. "I had a lavender frog which my mother gave me and I'd
hug it until I fell asleep."

Enjoy!
