,mr_Darcy,2008-02-19T22:53Z,"Ha, ha, ha. This movie must be based on an Åsa-Nisse movie script from the sixties. Who wants to see Jackie Chan sing? The first Rush hour was good. The second you could tolerate. This one sucks!"

,guitarhero2,2008-05-01T10:15Z,"Who marcus1991 is writing to? I guess it´s hdfghgdfhgdf who complained of the lack of dutch subs. marcus1991 probably think that ""dutch"" is the language used i Germany, and not i Holland....

Quick hint for marcus1991 ""deutsche"" and ""dutch"" is NOT the same thing.

That aside, he is right. If you dont understand english, then perhaps you should stop using the internet and give up trying to communiacate with the civilized world. Unless it´s a movie for kids, there isn´t really any need for subs at all unless you are woefully uneducated and simply slept through school. 

I speak french and spanish to, fluently. But since everbody in France and Spain who is not intressted in flipping burgers for a living speak english I feel like I could have used my time better than to learn local languages with no future.

Hey, writing comments are fun :) "
,pro2,2008-05-27T21:27Z,"thx, its awesome i can play it on my pc but i just want to know how do i put it on an empty dvd that will play on a pal dvd player, i already tried just putting it on that didn't work and i dont want to waste anymore disc so plz help, someone, and thanks in advance can't wait : ) oh btw is there any irrelevant files that i may delete because it is to large for my dvd+r thx again and im already seeding this "

type the model/make of your dvd player into your google/yahoo with the word hack after it.this should tell you how to make your dvd player multi regional through a hidden menu."
,arata75,2008-08-28T12:20Z,"What the fuck is up with all the crazy unorganized symbols in the description? I must not have the right fonts installed to see them.

Anyways, hope this works."
