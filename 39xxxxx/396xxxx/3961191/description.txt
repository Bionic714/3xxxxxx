READNFO because DoNE already has a DVDSCREENER out but this is from a different (clean)
source but with a different AR. Ours is 16:9 where as DoNE's was 2.35:1. See the pic
in Proof folder (DoNE's rip is the top video frame) to see that our source isn't just
cropped from a 2.35:1 version and has more video frame on the top and bottom when
compared to DoNE's but has a little cropped of the left and right edges.

Notes:
Unpacked - No rars
