[T],x_DontTreadOnMe_x,2008-01-09T21:16Z,"OR, simply buy a 308 rifle....much more power, range, and stopping power than the 7.62x39 OR .223."
,Silvertop1,2008-01-10T00:51Z,"20,000 rounds plus in a true Colt and not one jam. The good part is, I hit what I aim at, not so true with my SKS."

MY AR IS AN ARMORLITE,IM VERY PLEASED
WITH IT BUT I WOULD GIVE IT UP WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGT FOR AN M-1A,ALTHO ITS A LOT HEAVER I CAN HIT TARGETS ALOT FUTHER
 WITH QUITE A BIT OF POWER! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK"
,AlienZygote,2008-01-30T10:26Z,"It jams according to whom?  You probably don't even own a rifle in real life - as I will bet your firearms experience comes from playing AA.  I have a Bushmaster M-4 with over 4,000 rounds with 2 jams, both caused by bullets not seated deep enough due to a friend beginning at reloading.  However, I had a Hungarian AK made by FEG that was a hunk of shit due to a sorry ass welding job by Century Arms on their receiver.  By the way, I clean my M-4, but not obsessively.  Good quality lubricants and clean ammo will make a more reliable rifle from the Stoner design than a lot of video game and discovery channel noobs think."
,Handsolo,2008-04-25T05:05Z,"I have owned a colt AR15 and an AK underfolder both good guns the AR15 is a much nicer made weapon of superior quality keep it clean and it will never let you down. the AK was also fun but much more cheaply made and what people say is true they don't jamb and they pack more punch than a AR15 but I let mine go because I like quality and ther just isn't any with the AK.

It does it's job and that is as a 3rd world cheap assault rifle that can be fired and abused by illiterate poorly trained armys.

I got rid of both, the AK because it was cheap inaccurate junk and the AR15 because I wanted more firepower, now I have a .308 AR10 Armalite flat top with a scope and a 24"" heavy barrel, its the quality of an AR15 and packs way more punch than an AK can you say SNIPER rifle!

And the people that think AR 's jamb all the time have never owned one, keep it clean and it does its job well. Why doe you think Swat and regular police use AR15s and not AK's? If aks were better they would use them, I bought my AK in the 80s when they were $169 for the same rifle that now goes for $800, its a $200 rifle if you want to spend $800 buy an AR15 or jump up to the AR10 for $1200.

,hornetdt,2008-05-05T11:40Z,"For all of you simple sons of bitches who can't tie your own shoes, here's how you get an ar-15 not to jam in three simple steps.

1.  Clean your damn rifle.  A gun's like a cock, a clean one tends to have fewer problems as time goes by.

2.  When you aren't using it, keep your dust cover closed.  they don't put 'em there for looks.

3.  Dont use wolf ammo

Do these things and you'll suddenly notice an increase in reliability.  Then again, if you weren't doing these things to begin with, then you are probably one of those that should stick to ""comparative eDick studies with respect to my online first person shooter"" anyway.  Anyone who claims that an ak-47 is a superior arm has never fired one past 100 yards with the intention of actually hitting their target, with the stipulation that said target is not a house of course."
,Squrm,2008-05-14T20:23Z,"Dear Doofuses & retards:

First off, keeping your AR CLEAN isn't nearly as important as keeping it LUBED.  A dirty AR will still run just fine, an un-lubed one will not.  If you keep lubing it, a dirty rifle will run forever.

Secondly, OLD laquer coated wolf ammo sucked.  It would indeed gunk up your rifle.  Newer polymer coated ammo runs like a charm.  It's even cleaner than fricken Remington.

So please, stop regurgitating this old BS.  Next are you going to tell us about how it tumbles in flight and was designed to wound instead of kill?  Please..."
,C_Rex,2008-10-07T11:20Z,"Now, there are two kinds of AR-15: the ones that jam, and the ones that don't.  Same with AKs.  Ammo is also more of a factor in most ARs, since they're more precise when it comes to feeding and chambering.

Clean your damn gun.  Treat it well.  Don't buy garbage; ie, a receiver with M4 feed ramps, and a standard feed ramp barrel.

There are a number of things you can do to improve the reliability of your AR, as well.

Now, I own three ARs: a Bushmaster Varminter, DPMS carbine, and a homebuilt tube carbine.  Same with AKs: a WASR-2, Saiga conversion, and a Saiga 12, as well as a milled Polytech.

It really comes down to individual rifles, the WASR has jammed on me a number of times, and I've only really fired a few hundred rounds through it.  The polytech has never jammed, nor has the Saiga 12.  Ok, the 12 jammed once because I was using cheap buckshot, and it deformed when it was feeding, but that's no fault of the gun.  Likewise, my DPMS has only jammed once with good ammo, and when I fed it some bargain stuff with an 'IZ' headstamp, it did jam quite a bit.  The Bushmaster has never jammed, but did have a few problems feeding when I changed the gas block and didn't have it lined back up correctly.  The converted Saiga is a .308, and after the conversion it was totally reliable, but before then it did have issues feeding, as the piston was a little bit undersized.

Long story short, if you actually do have an AR and aren't just regurgitating crap you hear, and it's always jamming, and it's not some M1 Parts heap of junk, it's not the rifle's fault.  Clean your guns, don't use crap ammo, and learn how to use them!"
