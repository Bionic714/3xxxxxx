,grOyaBetariP,2008-07-27T18:13Z,"I cannot understand why so many idiots are still asking others to sign SIS files - get a grip of yourselves, go to 
https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page 
create a user account, standard email addresses are of NO USE, avoid hotmail, tiscali, etc, etc....if you need a usable email address go here and sign up for one, 
http://www.2ip.com/signup.php
Then head to 
https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do
LOGIN, then look down that page until you see a box where you put your phones IMEI, your newly made email address and point symbian to your SIS file for signing, if you dont see the word SUCCESS at the top of the page after uploading your SIS file, you fucked up, try again!.....when you've got that right, move on, read everything, follow all the prompts - its easy, if you fail in the end, stick a feather up your arse and do the funky chicken!
