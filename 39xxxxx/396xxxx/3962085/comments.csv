,deamon2000,2008-01-16T04:58Z,does this have the same errors as my version 
,Nitzrokk,2008-01-17T03:14Z,"Most likely... =\
Known and common errors are LAG which can be reduced by using the game ID from BioHazard when converting PSX IMG to PSP EBOOT (which I did, but it still lags a little when there are lots of things going on/several enemies). Also what I noticed with this here one is that during conversion and resizing the bottom of the screen got cut off so you can't see the time of the day, or the days very well--sorry about this."
