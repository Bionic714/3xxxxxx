I have to read this for a class this semester along with:

Politics of Rage
All God's Dangers
Strange Career of Jim Crow 

Anyone have any of these in audio? I travel 53 miles each way to classes, and find listening to the books in the car is a great way to not waste traveling time!

Thanks so much!"
