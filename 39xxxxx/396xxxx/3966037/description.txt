You get it all with Cryptograms, the sour and the sweet, the rough and the rousing, the bruising and the beautiful, the plush and the puerile, so it scooped a lot of us up with a net that was too broad to leave many stragglers. Looking at Deerhunterâ??s past tour itineraries only drives my point home like a tent stake into damp ground â?? Bradford Coxâ??s troops have been tamped beneath/coupled with acts big and small, from Smashing Pumpkins to The Ponys to Grizzly Bear. With a new version of Cryptograms out that includes the fantastic Flourescent Grey EP â?? not to mention a much-circulated risquÃ©-rock pic of Bradford getting his Coxucked ONSTAGE (by a dude no less) â?? I canâ??t think of a single reason Deerhunter wouldnâ??t at least draw mild curiosity
