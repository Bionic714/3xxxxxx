,BusterHyman,2008-01-10T14:43Z,"Movie quality is great but I cant get the sound working.. any ideas on what is going on?
Does anyone else have this problem?"
,LORD_KaOs,2008-01-10T18:16Z,"you know, all you guys need to fuck off and leave this guy alone. Klaxxon has never tried to proclaim that he is axxo or that he is better. Quite frankly i think you all suffer from axxo envy. You all compare everyone to axxo and when someone comes along with a part of his name is their's than you people really rip them apart. In closing i would like to say to Klaxxon, i love your torrents man. keep up the great work and don't let all the axxo lovin assholes get to you. Do what you do."
