,neonikngc,2008-01-05T15:43Z,Does the image ask for a serial number?? Would it work on a XPS laptop???
[T],mm3_hellraiser,2008-01-10T20:04Z,"Yes, this will work on an XPS. I have it working on one of my own.

No, it will not ask for a serial number."
,the_nakaii,2008-01-12T07:05Z,will it work on a virtual machine?
[T],mm3_hellraiser,2008-01-27T04:05Z,"No, VMs will not work because VMs aren't Dell PCs ;)"
,tbjerret,2008-02-06T15:25Z,"Hm. Seems to be using Vistaloader. By the way Dell OEM is kind of nonsense, Dells have a SLIC table in the bios so only the right key and certificate is needed. "
,turn2dust,2008-03-03T22:39Z,bootloader.. not cool stating this is a Dell OEM image.
,Radu82,2008-04-24T11:42Z,SEED PLEASE!
,iceman45,2008-05-22T08:44Z,turn2dust are you saying it has some addon bootloader with bickering written in it?
,Jmkurfess,2008-07-02T22:53Z,Works Thanks mm3_hellraiser and also you can get this working on any computer. All you need is a coa key on the bottom of a dell computer. The only bad thing is you get all the dell programs and your computer will think its a dell pc. But it still works :)
,spikesocoloco,2008-09-17T05:36Z,Is this 32bit or 64bit
,laser458,2009-01-31T16:35Z,How do i tell if my dell computer is compatable with windows vista is there anyway of checking /
,Appetite4Disaster-,2010-02-08T02:06Z,I updated this and got a Windows Counterfeit / fake message....
,Appetite4Disaster-,2010-02-08T16:10Z,and i got a Dell Inspirion 9150
