This is very popular in Japan and is a cult classic over there. If you're new to the series it may be hard at first as it takes a lot patience however gets very rewarding when you get in full control over your rail company, city and vast landscapes.There's no story to the game only mission objectives to achieve with no time limit. 
Everything runs fast with no slowdown whatsoever, with over 40 trains, 6 scenarios, 80 types of buildings. A huge amount of detail is put into the game environments, progressive lighting based on time of the day, weather, season, you can walk through your city or ride your train across the whole region complex railroad network system.Music is relaxing and sporadic, with all other in-game sounds fitting perfectly.Graphics and menus are great too and no loading times while playing.
