,MosePagh,2008-02-25T14:58Z,Does it work..?
,Zpik3,2008-03-12T08:51Z,"Nooope.. Doesn't work.

Or rather, the crack doesn't. I installed the game, then installed the crack to the same folder, and after about an hour the game cuts off and tells me to buy it. =|

Haven't found any other working version yet either."

2) DON'T run the game.
3) Run the CM_insaniQCRK_install.exe file.
4) play game!

,925bike,2010-05-08T18:23Z,I couldnt get this to work with Windows 7. Game wouldnt open.  I get 'Insanaquarium stopped working'
,Yunik,2010-05-14T07:21Z,"Works Great thanks Ozflik! and for the people who dont know how to install it right follow Muragas instructions
HERE'S how:
1. run setup file ~WinInsaniquarium_setup.exe~
2. when done installing ... before you click Finish ... make sure you uncheck the ""run game"" tab! VERYYY IMPORTAAANT!
3. copy then run ~CM_insaniQCRK_install.exe~ inside game directory
4. THAT'S IT ... WORKS GREAT!
5. ... and is bug free too."
,Marcus101RR,2010-08-01T06:33Z,"...FAKE...

This does not work, I installed the game, then the crack and it knocked me off in an hour. Absolute waste of time. Do not download."
,mawarm,2010-09-08T17:50Z,"This crack didn't work for me on Windows 7, allthough I've found a working version of this game with crack already installed, here's the link:

,ccrocker58,2011-02-08T09:01Z,"Yeah...so this DOES work...so long as you take some time to read the posts here...granted, it should have been told by uploader that you CAN'T run the game right after install, but still; check the 36 other posts before you start panicking...

Or just click the link Mawarm posted; crack is already applied to that one...and it took all of 19 seconds to download...for some reason this one took about 5 minutes."
,symown,2012-01-02T04:47Z,"60 minute trial, okay..."
