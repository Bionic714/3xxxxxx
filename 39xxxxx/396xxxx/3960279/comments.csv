If it's the origiginal (working) install DVD, thanks ^^"

,MacMikeProudhon,2008-01-14T18:13Z,"No joy on a G4 eMac. Following methods tried: 

Target Firewire (both ways)

Mounted onto a Firewire Drive (using Restore in Disk Utility)

Booting from DVD (CMD+Option+Shift+Del and holding down C on start, as well as Option, will not show up)

Booting from external DVD  (CMD+Option+Shift+Del and holding down C on start, as well as Option, will not show up)

My only guess is that this is not compatible with the G4 eMacs. Or my RAM is broken."
,danibo,2008-01-16T16:58Z,"Works flawlessly on my eMac 1.25Ghz G4.
Installed in less than 30 minutes.

1. Burn using Toast (it's a toast image)
2. Insert DVD in mac due to upgrade
3. Either click ""install"" on the DVD, or press and hold C during startup. (First option works best most of the time)"

,davbw,2008-02-02T19:17Z,"hello, very new to this torrent stuff, in fact
only 2 days.
  but I needed a copy of Tiger 10.4.6 
since I did not get one, when I bought my 
used laptop. I downloaded this torrent
Mac_OS_X_10.4_Tiger_DVD_(PPC)
I followed the instruction, for 
disk unitlity, mounted the file, burned the
file. there seems to be nothing on the DVD RW
I shut down the puter, started it with the
dvd in, held the controa and c keys
but still booted to the desktop...
I needd and install dvd to migrate to a
larger 2.5"" HD..80.gig...
any help
thanks
PS. toast 8 does not see the dvd "
,SmegmaTent,2008-02-03T03:02Z,"Once it has downloaded, mount the file in toast to make sure everything is ok.
then burn it in toast as an image file.
I didn't bother restarting my Mac, i just clicked on the install icon from the burnt disc.
My Mac was 10.3.9. G5, maybe thats why it worked.
I didn't use disc utitlity at all for this."
,davbw,2008-02-03T03:57Z,"thanks smegmatent.
 I think I found the problem. I have done
what you outlined..but the dvd is being

  My problem, being new to this
is that I only mounted the toast file
and not the txt file with it. when I looked
at the txt file, I could read nothing, so 
I think that is the leadin...
well I'll give it another try.

,chromatid,2008-04-01T21:56Z,"Burning this DVD image with 'growisofs' under Linux works fine, fwiw -- the resulting disc is bootable with no trouble at all, no need for format conversion, which was *not* the case with a another torrent packaged as ""dmg"" files.

So i just downloaded nero, burnt it on a dvd using the image burning function and booted it right up from my mac, took about 45min from start to finish. TY very much everyone!"
,dommidigital,2008-05-07T00:34Z,"Wanted to tell you guys I burnt it using Nero 8 on a PC. It worked.

1. Download the toast file.
2. Open nero, goto recorder, choose burn Image
3. *Select all files, then select your .toast image
4. A window will pop up, select HFS, this is the only setting you should change.
5. Burn it and stick it in your Mac, it'll boot it up flawlessly.

Took forever for me to figure this out cuz im a dummy! Hope it helps!"

I burnt this using toast 6 platinum by going to copy, then selecting the .toast file and burning it as an image. If I pop in the DVD, then click it normally, the restart option just gets the laptop to boot without updating the OS, then the hold down C trick doesnt work, and then selecting it as  the startup disk only gives me that ""dun"" sound, the one where its telling you it wont work. =/

,mehdihs,2008-11-06T08:10Z,"Well people You have to understand one thing. If you already have an earlier version of the OS installed this will work, but if you are trying to boot off the CD, it will not. Apple's bios has a feature programmed in it that recognises when a CD is an original CD or a burned disc. Therefore, you can only boot from an original retail disc, with the ""C"" key on startup or the ""option"" on startup. I worked at apple care so I know for sure."

When the ""Foreign Image Settings"" window pops up, the only change I had to make was to select HFS from the Type of Image drop down menu and it was ready to burn. I just used a regular DVD+R and I was able to boot from DVD without any issues. Either using the ""Startup Disk"" utility from withing OS X 10.3 or by holding the ""Option"" button during startup.

,Yazoo87,2009-02-04T20:38Z,"""Toast"" is a CD/DVD burning program like Nero or WinOnCD on windows.

Both (Toast and WinOnCD) are from Roxio, so you can almost say ""Toast is WinOnCD for Macs"" :D
just search for ""Toast Titanium"" here on TPB...


the image is a special .toast image.
made by a Toast version on a Mac.

i burned this image with Toast 7 Titanium on OS X 10.3.9

you have to burn it on the SLOWEST SPEED POSSIBLE!
i burned it at 8x Speed first. Disk was readable from within OSX 10.3.9, but not bootable..

then i burned it with the slowest speed my DVD Burner / Toast gave me as an option: 4x

took ages to burn, but the disk was finally bootable :)

so if you guys have problems: burn it with Roxio Toast 7/8/9 Titanium on a Mac 

Toast 7 is (AFAIK) the last version that works unter OS X 10.3.9..

at least Toast 8 didn't even start.. so i assume its for Tiger (10.4) only.."

,Pyatin,2009-12-30T06:38Z,"Well, I decided to test it out.  It works.  I used Toast Titanium 8 on a Mac with a DVDRW.  You must select Copy>Image File and then choose the OSX file.  Click on 'Recorder', click on the 'Advanced' tab and uncheck 'Verify Data'.  It just finishes the disc faster.  Verify is just an extraneous task.  Now click 'Record' and you're good to go.

Now the drive on the MacG4 I used the disc on originally had a DVD-RAM drive.  It is a very temperamental drive.  I swapped it out for a regular DVD±RW, and it read the disc fine and installed without a hitch.  I burned both DVD+R and DVD-R discs, and they both work great.  If you have a DVD-RAM drive, and it won't read the disc...swap the drive.  The DVD-RAM reads factory pressed DVDs fine.  maybe a firmware update is in order."

,unckybob2,2010-07-24T21:35Z,"There's some difficulty doing a fresh install from this DVD. Here's a quote from another comment:

Well people You have to understand one thing. If you already have an earlier version of the OS installed this will work, but if you are trying to boot off the CD, it will not. Apple's bios has a feature programmed in it that recognises when a CD is an original CD or a burned disc. Therefore, you can only boot from an original retail disc, with the ""C"" key on startup or the ""option"" on startup. I worked at apple care so I know for sure. 

End quote. 

Currently the price for a factory disk is around $100. However, you can get a factory disk for 9.1 for around $10. My question: 

Is it possible to install 10.4 directly from 9.1? Please answer and save me a lot of frustration. "

I found out you can install 10.4 from OS8 and OS9. "
,slix19,2010-08-04T20:31Z,"Some advice, *please* read it:

1. This is ONLY for the older PPC Macs - G4 and G5 CPUs, NOT Intel.
2. It WILL NOT work to turn a PC into a Mac, these need Intel discs. And if you don't already know this don't fuckin do it! You clearly aren't bright/knowledgeable enough - so WHEN you try and fail, you deserve to fuck up your PC.

3. Burn with Toast as an Image File, not a Data Disc.
4. Burn on a DVD-R, NOT DVD+R or DVD+/-RW.
5. Do NOT mount it first before burning.
6. Use in a Mac WITH a DVD reader. Older PPC Macs sometimes have just CD readers.
7. PPC Macs WILL NOT boot from USB - only internal HDD, CD or DVD, or Firewire connected HDD or DVD.
8. It WILL boot like a retail disc if the Mac can read DVDs, the disc is burned properly and you press the correct key (hold ALT/Option during the chime until you get a choice of the DVD or hard drive.

Anyone who says the Mac can detect a real or burned disc clearly knows fuck all: if it has a crap/old DVD reader though it won't read badly burned discs or none DVD-Rs. (IF this person really worked for AppleCare they were clearly sacked for knowing nothing...)

Finally: READ THE DAMN COMMENTS. The above has been stated often on this torrent page. Again, if you don't know how to even use a computer, torrent or webpage, DON'T - or at least actually try to learn like we all did. If you want us to do it all for you, PAY US."

I checked it on my g5 imac to see if I could install it onto that just to see if it was working and I had the same problem. It tried to boot then instead of completing the boot the screen showed a circle with a line through it. 

The ISO file was burned with disk utility. I notice that it says not to open the image before burning, can this have caused the problem if so can it be fixed?. btw I have 10.2.8 on the flat panel imac.

So a friend gave me this eMac and I'm thinking its going to be an old busted machine, come to find out its better than the older model PC I'm using, go figure! So I download and do a fresh install of Panther 10.3 and it doesn't have the right display driver so even though the install went smooth and the eMac is running great, it has a small, tiny display in the middle of the screen. So now I want to download and try Tiger since that's most likely the OS that originally came on the eMac. That being said, I'm using a PC to download/install this. To do Panther, I used Transmac to burn the dmg files onto DVD for installation. My question is ... how am I going to burn a .toast file so that it is bootable by Mac?

,Putrid186,2011-02-04T01:45Z,"Quick tut for those running windows on how to burn and run successfully.  

Download torrent here.  file downloaded is ""Mac OS X Install DVD.torrent""  Rename this to ""Mac OS X Install DVD.iso""  There is no need to use a converter program.

I used ImgBurn (http://www.imgburn.com) It's free and powerful.

Place a blank DVD+R or DVD-R into your drive ( I have not tested DVD-R but others here say it has worked).  Open ImgBurn, choose ""Write image file to disc.""

Next to ""Please select a file..."" Click the small folder icon and browse to the ""Mac OS X Install DVD.iso"" you just downloaded, highlight and select ""Open.""

This step may not be necessary but to be safe I'd follow it: The bottom left area of this screen has another small icon with a book.  Hovering over it gives you the tooltip ""Change book type...""  Click on this.  Click the tab of the manufacturer of your drive.   For ""Change For:"" Change to ""Next Write.""  For ""New Setting:"" Change to ""DVD-ROM.""  DONT PRESS OK YET.  Press ""Change.""  You'll get a message saying the change was successful.  Now press OK.  Again, you should be able to skip this step, but if you're doing something stupid like using a DVD-RW and you don't realize it, this will correct your ass.

CHANGE THE SPEED to 1x.  Do it.  The program will automatically adjust to the lowest possible speed but this is the safest.  The installer does a CRC check to make sure everything is PERFECT so your burn has to be PERFECT.

Burn!

Simply place the disc into the mac and reboot.  This should boot from disc automatically whether you have an OS installed or not, so do not hold down C or Option or any other keys while booting."

,slitcher,2011-02-20T23:53Z,"IT WORKS !!! Thanks a lot !!! Since most people seem to have difficulties with the torrent here is a quick how to

Installed on a 2005 ibook G4, 1,33Ghz, 512mb ram

Procedure (using Macbook Pro 2010):

- Rename the file to change extension from .toast to .iso
- Using disk utilities, Burn the image to a DVD-R
- Insert the DVD in the iBook
- Click the Mac OS X installation icon

I chose to format the HD prior to installing OS X
- When the installation box opens, click on utilities on the top bar and then disk utility
- Select the Macintosh HD and format the drive

- Follow the installation process
- Enjoy your freshly installed OS X"
,linkinpark187,2011-02-24T16:50Z,"You don't need to rename the file.  Download and install ImageBurn, that will burn the *.toast file without a problem."
,blackwebhost,2011-02-27T15:48Z,"This may have been asked but anyway here goes.
I have a HP Compaq DC7100 CMT running Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit with 1GB Ram, 250GB 7,200RPM HD and a Intel (something or other) intergrated card. I am wanting to run this on PearPC. What is the exact version number.. i know its 10.4 but 10.4.what? Also can I boot this DVD if i follow the instructions (nero 10) on my pc..."
,blackwebhost,2011-02-27T15:50Z,"P.S. CPU is Pentium 4 HT 2.8GHz.
If i boot this from DVD it will be on a 40GB 7,200RPM HD (not messing up my 250GB until I know it works) "
,tino730,2011-03-04T09:11Z,Um you guys IM NOT SURE IF YOU CAN READ BUT ITS FOR PEAR PC IF YOU READ THE TITLE IT WILL SAY PPC WHICH IS SHORT FOR PEAR PC.
,tino730,2011-03-04T09:21Z,Ubuntu 10.10 looks alot like mac with a dock it's so strange it's like Apple made Ubuntu.
,tysiin,2011-03-05T01:36Z,actually ppc stands for power pc
,Jon55,2011-03-05T16:31Z,"No, it's not. This is for Power PC."
,Jon55,2011-03-05T16:34Z,"That last comment was directed towards tino730.

Again, THIS IS NOT FOR PEAR PC. THIS IS FOR POWER PC (PPC). I've never even heard of PearPC."

any help? "
,turoks,2011-10-10T00:31Z,"Thanks a lot for the comments here on how to write the image file, also thanks to the uploader, I finally got my PowerMac G4 running again. Thanks again people."
,vivatpb5776,2011-10-18T10:12Z,"Worked flawlessly. I am a first time Mac user so I was under the misconception that the DVD had to be bootable when burned. That is not correct. Once the DVD is installed in a computer that supports the OS version, the installation process began.

I am running updates like a champ. This is going to be interesting. Thank you uploader."
,vivatpb5776,2011-10-18T10:15Z,"FYI: I used Magic ISO to burn the DVD and I burned at the lowest speed possible (31x). At first, the process would not start and the computer shut itself off. However, upon restart, everything started as normal."
,macmaniac2010,2011-11-09T19:37Z,"Worked great!! It is Installing now!!! 
This is what i did.. botched one DVD before getting this one right:

After Downloading the file i renamed it using the same name but with extension .iso instead of .toast
(This is easily done by clicking on on the file, then, not too quickly, clicking the name and it should let you edit it. Don't delete all of the name and retype, thats just a waste of time, instead go to the end and delete toast and type in iso. Hit Enter, and click ""Use .iso"")
Next, go to applications and utilities and run ""Disk Utility"". Insert your blank DVD and click Burn at the top. Select your file that now has the .iso extension. Mine ended up being name ""Mac OS X Install DVD.iso"" burn it to your DVD.
Next, insert the DVD into the computer you want to upgrade and let it run the installer.
Finally, enjoy your computer that now has a working copy of Mac OS X 10.4. At no cost to you other than a little time and a few bucks for some DVDs."

,kal7,2012-01-17T10:03Z,"Okay, well i see a lot of you didn't get this working. thats okay. neither did i. however if you go to this torrent right here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6823762/All_Mac_os_versions_9.2.2_to_10.7

you find all the versions of Mac OS X from 9.2 to 10.7. IF, you just need 10.4, like this torrent then its simple. download the torrent file, open it with your torrent client. then usually a window pops up with the download directory at the top, and the files in the torrent in the box at the bottom. just deselect all the checkboxes for the versions of OS X you dont need (for example 10.7, 10.6, etc) and hit ok or download or whatever. if the window doesn't pop up, then there should be some way to view the files in a torrent. google it if you dont know. Okay, so it takes a while to download, so i would advise you to do it at night before you go to bed & just leave your computer on. mine finished in a couple hours. okay, so now in the Mac OS folder, there should be a folder called ""MacOS X 10.4.0 (Tiger)-Spanned."" Open it, and you have your 4 ISO files ready to burn to CD. burn all 4 cd's & label them. put the 1st cd i(disk1) in the mac you're trying to install to, and press the ""ALT"" key on a mac keyboard while booting up. after a while, you'll get a blue screen, just select the one with the picture as a CD. the name of the cd should be whatever you set it to. make sure it's selected, click the arrow, and you're done. currently installing tiger on a 10.3.9 700MHz iMac PowerPC G4. that torrent i linked to above is useful, you can upgrade G4's/G5's up to leopard as far as i know. you can use the leopard dvd iso included to try and jump to 10.5 if you want. but anyway, this is my solution."
,Mr.Buddha,2012-04-15T22:49Z,Can I use this with a flash drive?
,worldend3,2012-06-20T05:17Z,"work perfect on my Mac Pro 2.5 GHZ I used Power Iso just 
1- open power iso then click burn on top
2- search for location of the toast file, make sure  you select all files scroll down to  all files as  supported file for the toast to appear 
3- select the toast file then click burn to empty DVD.

,phoboskitty,2012-08-04T04:43Z,"ok so i am using a windows 7 computer to download this, i did change the .toast to .iso, the mac i am trying to upgrade is a PPC G4 ( the cool pedestal ones ) its currently running 10.3 so i was reading that you can not do a direct upgrade install from 10.3 it tells me to reboot and it will install but it dose nothing... the computer reads it fine, i was wondering if i have to do it as a clean install, 10.3 will not let me wipe the drive, now it has since occurred to me that i need to be logged in as a root user to do this ( could this be my problem) the drive utility just will not let me wipe the drive in the admin account i created for this computer. so i am not a super mac user but somewhat familiar with them so i am wondering if the MAC will automatically boot the .iso image when i have wiped the OS off the computer? or should i burn the disc with .toast or .dmg ? to accomplish this? thanks ahead of time for anyone trying to help me out :)"
,phoboskitty,2012-08-11T02:19Z,"i know its been awhile lets just hope someone is paying attention to this thread, using power ISO on a Win 7 machine, did the change to .iso thing but i am using a Pedestal G4 iMac which has 10.2.8 on it now, the automatic upgrade will not work from this OS version, restarting and holding down C will do nothing restart with Option key only shows my local drive to boot from no DVD ( I can not burn the .iso image with the Mac as it dose not have the DVD burner. can you even boot from a DVD with these iMacs? this has been a tough one to figure out some help would be nice thank you..."
,bootpoop,2012-08-20T22:16Z,"i just followed the instructions about changing the file to .iso and using disk utility.
the first time it didn't work. the disk couldn't verify and didn't work.
the second time i changed the burn speed (like so many actually said you need to do but i chose to ignore!) to the lowest and it worked.
installing now on a lovely green G3 imac! 
thanks!"
,phoboskitty,2012-08-23T21:24Z,"this disc is not intended to be installed on an iMac ( G4 pedestal)it is not a universal installer disc, i did alter the OSTInstall file to remove iMac from the list of banned computers, it is now installing but but there seems to be some problem now, it starts its install and then fails right at the end with an error message i have tried every install method it say my disc might be dirty it has problems reading the disc but now i can not seem to figure out how to eject the disc now, eject button on key board is no longer working i think because the previous install is no longer present? or its archived... it says there is still something on the disc but i can not start up with the old version now to open the disc drawer, is there any tricks to getting the dvd drive to open? like in single user mode or something? i have spent alot of time for on this for my GF ( I fucking hate Macs they are bullshit ) or can anyone point me in the direction of a 10.4 disc that is a universal installer disc and not machine specific?"
