Another great New Years show by Patti and her band!

Forgot to mention this on the audience version: for some reason Lenny\'s mics are very low in the mix this night. The same is true for this broadcast, but the sound is otherwise great!

Station identifications are left intact, as they did not cut into any music, and hardly into any of Patti\'s talking. I did not find it annoying enough to warrant what removing them would do to the recording. The Dj seems to know just when to talk without being a complete pain in the ass.

Anyway, as you may have guessed, this is the better sounding of the 2 recordings, but I figured if you were there,or simply wish you were, you might want to hear both versions.

So here\'s my usual plug for the band- Please support Patti and buy her music. She has a brand new album on i-tunes as of yesterday. ALso, the opening act, Alejandro Escovedo is amazing and well-deserving of your support too!

So please enjoy, and convert to MP3 for personal use ONLY, thanks.


Happy New Year to all the ART Rats out there! ;-)

Peace.
