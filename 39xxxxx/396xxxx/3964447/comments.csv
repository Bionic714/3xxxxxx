,rollerbase,2008-01-16T13:42Z,flac is better...... Ok it`s bigger but still it`s better....
,Evil_Communist,2008-01-16T18:42Z,What's the thing with (FLAC) is it better quality? Cause these files are way bigger than my 320 kbps mp3s. :P
,skyseason,2008-01-19T00:28Z,"lossless is very much appreciated - however, don't say it's FLAC when it's WMA Lossless. capiche?"
,cyberwast,2008-01-28T14:36Z,"if you want mp3s, the internet is filled with mp3 versions of this album. 

The ones who appreciate and know the difference in quality of flac, download these files.

If you're the average moron who can't notice the difference between mp3 and cd, don't look for flac files please."
,oganso,2008-02-16T16:17Z,FAKE. This is not FLAC. it's wma. 
,miskomali,2008-07-28T17:27Z,this is f****** .wma!!! NOT flac!
,Enkuturi,2008-09-19T18:31Z,Just download the flacs or wma and then convert them to mp3... whats the problem?
,iToasty,2009-11-20T19:47Z,"@aswqeee 
FLAC is almost 4 times higher quality than mp3
and can easily be converted into .wav format for your iTunes or iPod, or if you hate using FLAC players like i do. FLAC is a fucking miracle, an exact rip quality. i understand if you would like to mp3 more, less of a hassle, yes. but FLAC is definately worth it considering there is no problems or ""lossy"" qualities. Free Lossless Audio Codec is something i've recently discovered and wish that all my music was in this format. although it is quite a bit of space. i guess if you only want to use it for your iPod or if you just want the music, go ahead and use mp3, but never use anything under 320 kbps"
,iToasty,2009-11-20T19:48Z,"sorry for the double post, but for all of you complaining about how this isnt exactly FLAC,
if you were to convert with FLAC Frontend, in which i use, then it will be the same quality as a wma or wav format, therefore you all must assume that this wasnt flac to begin with? much better than any mp3 one you will find."

I needed to convert it though...
FLAC rulez !"
