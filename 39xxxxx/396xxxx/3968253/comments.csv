I forgot to mention that different sources show  1982 or 1983 as the release date of the film. Both are somehow correct because the film was shown three times for limited audience in a film festival in late 1982. In 1983 it was released for broad audience.

The film is really moving, even after over two decades. I saw it for first time in the beginning of the nineties, somewhere in Central Europe, as a VHS copy of a copy. The film was heart touching and impressed me much. I bought the DVD disc last year (BTW, ouch, it was bloody expensive...) I mean in 2007 and I thought that I should share the film with you."
