Some remarks from me: the audio stream is stereo only, but you are in privilledged situation anyway because the theatrical release was mono only (yes, mono!). No 5.1 is available. The video stream was just transcoded \"as is\" from MPEG 2 to H.264 (double pass) without any changes. There is some blockiness visible in some scenes but I am not sure if it was the fault of my DVD disc or it was made on purpose by the film director. I have no access to any other copy of the film so I cannot compare my DVD to anything. BTW, it was hard to encode the film - it was hard to rip it and the encoding had to last long. You will need a decent player in order to utilize the multiple subs, e.g. The KMplayer:

Enjoy!
