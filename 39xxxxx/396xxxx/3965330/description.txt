Woman in the Dunes
Suna no onna 
(1964) Hiroshi Teshigahara 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058625/

An amateur entomologist searching for insects by the sea is trapped by local villagers into living with a mysterious woman who spends almost all her time preventing her home from being swallowed up by advancing sand dunes. The woman and the trapped man begin a strange and erotic relationship that stretches over years, as the man's hope for escape dims. 

A magnificent new rip from the Criterion Edition. I need say no more.
