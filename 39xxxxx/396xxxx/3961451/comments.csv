,silentwaiting,2008-03-20T06:20Z,"that's not actually a Trojan. ive used the DrXJ hack for a very long time and it works well. it's just how it's hacked, but it isn't a Trojan."
,piratelordsss,2008-03-31T13:55Z,what is trojan?
,Lf2,2008-04-03T14:08Z,"A trojan is a very very horrible virus! It enables the creator to hack/control the computer it is on. But the only way to get it onto your computer is to run it. That is why people stick it into an .exe file. So when you run the file, you also get a nasty little Trojan virus. Watch out for em. "
,cheikh,2008-10-06T20:37Z,"as far as i can see the drxj is called a trojan by antiviruses because it cracks a program and changes reg's so you can play it ...thats it..... ime using it already.....had to make an exeption in my anti vir. or it wont start

,Slashdx,2008-10-20T08:24Z,"Thx Mate, Working here! :D"
,PG1021,2009-02-11T07:47Z,"Thanks Ozflik!!!

      Downloaded within 5 minutes, and works great as long as you dont try to mess with the files, which, you shouldn't anyways...

    I am starting to wonder about the logic that the population of TPB has nowadays though, because if 3 people said it worked well, why am I the only one (so far) that has given it good rep???"
,PG1021,2009-02-11T22:00Z,"Oooh, also I discovered something, aft er restarting my computer, and trying to run the pro version (crack), it gave me a .dll error. so I looked into it. After about 10 minutes, I discovered that you need to run it as Admin...

Sooo, for all of you Vista users, or those of you who (like me) decided to Beta Windows 7, Right click the shortcut and click properties, after that, under the shortcut tab, click advanced. You should see the option to run as Administrator, check it. This may only work for windows 7, as I don't have a pc with vista handy, but you should be able to find out how to run it as Admin.. 

Annnyyyway, good luck, and again Thanks for the good upload. and guys, When you dl this, give some good rep.."
,TeamPirateLive(TPL),2009-02-16T04:05Z,"Fast download, and works great. Thanks Ozflik!

We had to disable our antivirus program temporarily to use the crack. We were a bit skeptical at first, but everything worked fine and smoothly."
,x1337ELiTex,2009-03-13T21:42Z,Works Awesome! THX a lot! :)

Clamwin. Not Norton AntiShit, Clamwin."
,Zero-Hero,2009-06-26T13:08Z,"Works fine for me, no probem.
Seeding for a short time."
,gidvid23,2009-07-17T02:47Z,"Works fine here as well.
alwayz seeding!"
,DarkStormz999,2009-09-04T16:08Z,"Scanned the DrXJ.eve file with Kaspersky Internet Security 2009, latest virus update, and it detected nothing.

It seems to be working fine. Just install, and then run the crack.exe.

But as one person said earlier, if you're using Vista, be sure to right click on the desktop shortcut, and hit, ""Run as Administrator"".

Thanks uploader!"
,Ash96,2009-12-17T10:12Z,"plzzzz seed guys..too slow??..n plz give me reviews abt it..
