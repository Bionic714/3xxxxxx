,og900,2008-01-08T14:57Z,"Hi!

I don't understand how to crack the program. I've signed the sis-file, but when I run the prog. nothing happens, more than tomtom starts. What should I do with the other files? (not the crack) Install them on the phone? Put them in a certain folder?

Thanks!

,philskynet,2008-01-10T00:18Z,can someone tell me how to put this on an n95  or is it no good.....big smiles!!!!
,simmcca,2008-01-10T09:58Z,"On my nokia N73 and N95 works perfect. 
How to install: put your minisd or microsd card in the cardread and copy the contents of the file ""zkopirovat na minisd"" to the root of the minisd or microsd. Put the sd cart bact in your phone. 
Via PC suite install the crack. 
That's it. "
,simmcca,2008-01-10T10:01Z,"I forget, before you install the crack you have to set the date to year 2007!!!!"

,NLmaxdamage,2008-11-14T16:50Z,"Yo simmcca please help me out man. i have put the files in my phone (nokia n96) and i copyd the crack using pc suite, and i have set back the time to 2007 , and i installed the crack succesfully. but how do i start the damn thing?"
,JohnnyProblemsolver,2010-02-20T11:14Z,"Works like a charm on my N73.
Includes map BeNeLux 6.05 but you should be able to add maps as desired.

Copy the content of ""zkopirovat na minisd"" to your SD card.
Set the date of the phone to february 2007.
Connect phone via PC suite and double click (in explorer) the file ""TomTom.Mobile.v6.01.S60v3.SymbianOS9.1.Cracked-BiNPDA.sis"" (from crack folder).
Nokia PC suite will install it, accept installation on your phone.
Set the date on your phone back to normal.
Go to Applications on your phone, TomTom should be there, just click ""accept"" a few times and done!

Note if your phone does not have inbuilt GPS you need a separate one, 25? on Ebay, like the LD-3W.
Without a GPS mouse you can only use TomTom as a map.

Thanks to uploader."
