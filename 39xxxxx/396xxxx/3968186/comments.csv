,NeoMouser,2008-01-09T07:42Z,"id say its legit though

,emla2bu7a5,2008-01-09T08:20Z,"it's probably legit
i'll give it a try
speed is quite good (better than the rar version)"
,latulipe,2008-01-09T22:37Z,"this whole 'unpacked'-thing is just plain questionable, useless and for sure doesn't help a bit with sharing..."

You just download a hundred small files, and then you have to unrar to other folder which takes double the space and effort. I prefer unpacked, so the video is immediately ready to be watched. And there's even the sample from where you can check the quality the same way as with .rared torrent. Kudos to the uploader!"
