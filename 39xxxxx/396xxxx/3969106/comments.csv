,Depths,2008-01-13T00:00Z,"Is it safe? No risk of trojans, hacking or other problems with piracy after having applied this?"
[T],Zyphrus,2008-01-13T16:36Z,"This is a proper scene-release, which means there's  no risk for trojans/spyware/hackingtools, etc."

,tAb00,2008-01-19T13:17Z,Anyone know if it works om MCE 2005? Or do anyone know if its a Genuine Advantage Validation for MCE 2005 anyway?? Have not found any working yet. Only that works for a short time or a Win Upd..
