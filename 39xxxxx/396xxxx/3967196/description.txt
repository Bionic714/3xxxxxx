The Red Skelton Show, which premiered on 30 September 1951, was not 

only one of the longest running variety series on television, but also 

one of the first variety shows to make the successful transition from 

radio to television. Despite his popularity as an entertainer in 

nightclubs, vaudeville, radio and 26 feature films, Skelton was unsure 

of the new medium. Consequently, he continued his weekly radio 

broadcasts while simultaneously working on the first two season of his 

television show.

The series originally aired in a half-hour format on NBC. Despite an 

outstanding first year in which his show was ranked fourth in the 

Nielsens and won two Emmy awards, the series' ratings toppled in its 

second season. When NBC canceled the show, it was immediately picked up 

by CBS, and The Red Skelton Show became a Tuesday night staple from 

1954 to 1970.
