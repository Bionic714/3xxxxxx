:)"
,dartmouth,2008-01-12T02:48Z,very much appreciated : )  hope you're right about the new mixes being better than some of these crap dance mixes..nin and manson mixes have sounded more like korn mixes lately
,FCCKiller,2008-03-09T10:38Z,"Thank you! I have been looking for some of these remixes.

I crave high quality music, but 192 kbps MP3s isn't too bad for the remixes I was searching for. ;)"
,stefthekiller,2008-03-25T08:12Z,"does anyone have this lossless? or is mp3 the only available source for this?

greets stefan"
