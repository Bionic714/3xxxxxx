Tangemassa, dude, seed to completion, thanks for posting but either complete one torrent upload and move on, or just move on."
,hepek,2008-03-14T18:07Z,is this with original English sound or dubed Spanish?
,chrissiek,2008-04-18T00:20Z,I'm stuck at 81.9% after 12 hours of keeping my window open. :(  Can anyone reseed this so I can complete the download and watch this? I haven't seen this since I was 12!  Thanks so much!
,chrissiek,2008-04-18T05:39Z,Stuck now at 83.6%. I would really appreciate it if someone could FINISH the seed instead of just opening it for a bit and closing it. Thanks!
,chrissiek,2008-04-22T05:19Z,Just a note - this version has subtitles on it. 
,todu,2008-05-03T00:15Z,Thisw version has Norwegian subs hard encoded.
,brenT22,2008-08-30T05:47Z,"Sound quality is sorta shitty and visuals aren't amazing but are fine.

As others said, this has subs on it.

Probably the best version on TPB though."
