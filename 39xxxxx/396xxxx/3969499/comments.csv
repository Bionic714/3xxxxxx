,co2168,2008-01-10T00:43Z,how is the quality
,dreadinc_release,2008-01-10T00:44Z,"audio is bout a 9
video prolly a 6 or 7 -
BUT
Very Watchable- and quite frankly from the rest of the releases i've seen - I personally think this beats all. "
,co2168,2008-01-10T00:51Z,"thank you for your comments and upload, i will try downloading and let everyone else know"

,webslicer,2008-01-10T02:53Z,"next time create a 1 minute sample avi, and pack the full avi in 14.3 MB file segments with no compression and a 1% recovery record. name your files according to Movie.Name.Year.Source.FileFormat-GroupName"
,dreadinc_release,2008-01-10T02:57Z,"will do, thanx for the info :)"
,MysticMatter187,2008-01-10T09:13Z,"Is this the same as the crackpots cam?  Just don't want to dl the same thing again.  the crackpots cam sounds about the same quality as you described in yours.  overall good cam, but hard to see some of the darker scenes."
,hadji1,2008-01-10T15:43Z,terrible quality..but if u need to see it..ok !!
,co2168,2008-01-10T19:29Z,"Its watchable, all in all about 5 out of 10.  Hey what can you say for something free though.  So thank you for uploading for us and good luck with future uploads. "
,allaboutND,2008-01-12T02:35Z,"hey man, keep in mind everyone is a critic, and i see how nitpicky people can be by their adolescant commens they leave on the torrent sites, but just do your thing and thanks for doing it so lazy bastards like me dont have to go to the theatres..lol. "
,Perseus73,2008-01-12T18:50Z,"Typical cam, but don't let that put you off, keep trying.


A: 3/10
V: 4/10

In my humble opinion."
,acp35,2008-01-12T19:29Z,Disapponted took over a day to download and when it did it blocked me until I got something called DOM DIVx . Not cool at all...
,metal_head81,2008-01-12T21:22Z,"dude you actuall installed that shit.i wouldnt doubt it if your infected with some kind of virus or trojan of some sort.screw this dude,think ill wait till it comes out on dvd"
,Quirky_Puppy,2008-01-14T01:16Z,"@acp35

If by some miracle you're not one of the paid employees of an anti-piracy group that spend all day pretending to talk like a retard and accuse torrentz of being passworded or virused, then i have one thing to say to you:

Retard.

Don't blame what all the other comments say to be a perfectly good torrent for your own infected, piece of crap PC.

@dreadinc_release

Don't let the pricks put you off, thanks for the upload. I've not downloaded it, and I'm not going to, no offence, I just don't watch cams or TS unless the comments are really good!

Keep up the good work though."
,briley,2008-01-14T23:24Z,"Cant get sound to work :( sum1 help
quality dont look half bad"
,briley,2008-01-14T23:29Z,this is the only file iv ever had a problem with surely all the comments towards sound and i aint got shit savage >:(
,dreadinc_release,2008-01-15T15:01Z,"to those whom it may concern:

1) if you can play .divx movie your stupid
2) if you dont have sound codecs get em
3) you shouldnt have to ""install"" anything to play the video file
4) im not a RIAA or antipiracy group
5) for my first try i think i did pretty goddamned good
6) thanks to all who support!!
7) more to come soon-- ty!"
,flash20,2008-01-15T19:33Z,"dreadinc-release

,rokridge,2008-01-16T04:56Z,"I'm not getting any sound either, I download plenty of things but this only has sound on my setup for a split second when you skip forward. "
,co2168,2008-01-18T04:49Z,"To all that want to download this, I have DLed it myself.  I would rate it 5 out of 10.  It is watchable alittle dark in the dark scenes.  I did not have to DL anything extra to watch the movie.  Give props to dreadinc for uploading for all of us so we dont have to go to the movies to spend money."
,Perseus73,2008-01-19T13:56Z,"If you are struggling with sound, check your codecs."
,russtesha,2008-01-19T15:24Z,"i deos rarely comment but this is a cam yes but the dvd aint out yet anywhere in the world so id like to see other comments not whining at it..... it worked 100% fine for me and took only  few hours to download which iz good

if anyone cant watch it id advise to get the gordian knot codec pack from sourceforge.net

dreadinc_release ya better than most for a first release so respect to ya m8 and keep it up..... to use a household name amongst torrent networks please remember ""AxxO"" started at the bottom somewhere

anyway it looks like a better than avearage cam, its not stupidly large and its watchable....... it isnt passworded on the rar file so my advice to anyone wanting to download this is download it watch it and shut up unless your actually gonna thank dreadinc_release for his time

PLEASE REMEMBER IT TAKES TIME FOR PEOPLE TO GENERATE FILMS BY EITHER RIPPING OR CAMMING AND UPLOAD THEM SO THANK THEM RATHER THAN WHINE AND ACT LIKE A SPOILT BIATCH

dreadinc_release nuff respect to ya on first release and jah bless"
,seth54,2008-01-20T06:02Z,"hey dumb ass u dont go to the fucking theatre and videotape it with people there and you talking in the background,fuckin nube. this video suck's really bad ..video is 1 sound is 0. "
,dsyltie,2008-01-20T07:13Z,afraid sound does not work. btw - problem is unique to this torrent.
