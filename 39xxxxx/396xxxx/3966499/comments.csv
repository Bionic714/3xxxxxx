wrote about dont download power iso etc daa 0r uif
because of viruses but when i downloaded this 
bs player it had a virus in the key gen i dont know if 
you know about it or ot or even care as just about every other torrent of this same file has a virus in it as well but if you are going to quoate on other programs please check your own firsti i
dont mean too be nasty of anything but i wish that people would check there own files before calling over ones down if you do care about what you put on line  put in a keygen that will actually
work for people otherwise whats the point in putting it in at all. 
                                thanks"
