Finally after searching everywhere on the internet and peer 2 peer programs I managed to download this fantastic album and I am presenting this to all thepiratebay.com community as token of my gratitude for all the bounties I have found and downloaded off of this website. 

This album is very rare to find elsewhere, until now! So grab a copy and please continue seeding because I don't know how long I can keep it up! I encourage anyone to post links of this torrent on forum sites or elsewhere. What I ask is only that you give credit to my hard work to find, download, tag perfectly, and embed the mp3 with the 500x500 artwork. Also leave a comment of Thank-you if you have been looking for this and finally found it. It would be appreciated.
