,eros_man_gr,2010-05-06T03:44Z,"This is an amazing work, and I am glad somebody put it up as an audiobook. Just to help save others some time; the eighth track gets placed in the wrong order, because the album title there has an extra space in it (took me quite a while to figure that one out). Just change the info on the track and remove the extra space after ""Satanic Verses"". Long live Rushdie!"
