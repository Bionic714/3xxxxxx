,labanane,2009-01-28T03:34Z,"Did anyone get that Stop Motion Pro 5.1 to work as full software? 
I get it only as a trial version.

Anyway, many thanks to monur72"
,fluxcap,2009-07-26T02:22Z,Jeez! Awesome pack. Thanks!!!
,visionbat,2010-03-11T14:21Z,I had the same deal with 5.1 only the trial version.It says you have to register on their website to open it full. Sound risky. Version 4 works great. I have the trail version of the new version 7. 4 has most of the same features. Animator dv works fine and has pretty much the same stuff with a good user guide. I plan to eventually buy the latest version though it has some very cool new features. Didn't open the other stuff I didn't recognize
,ROFL_A_PIGGY,2010-06-28T05:23Z,"Working fine for me, thanks for the upload. 

To get it to work: install stop motion pro, then use the info from text file to register it for full version.

That's all I did and it works lol."
,myared,2010-10-30T23:34Z,"You know, i've been looking for such things everywhere. I really hope this works."
,anthonygr,2010-12-29T23:29Z,thank you :)
