Story :

Phao is a young muay thai fighter living in a small town and training in a fighting camp. Though muay thai is the center of his life, it is not appreciated by everyone around him, except his closest friends, Piak and Samaw, who are also young fighters. One day, his long-lost father returns and trains the trio as the last group of fighters to take on the best.
