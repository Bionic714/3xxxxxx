,EzeRoss,2008-01-14T03:35Z,"Website is a bona fide legal international home business with no buy ins, no monetary gains from sign ups, a 35 year old 4 star quoted Parent company with real quality next generation health and wellness products with a binary compensation plan. The websites are free, as is the support, and the tools are available at cost.
Not one part of that makes it a pyramid, maybe you should have done a bit more research, before commenting. I would never knowingly promote such a scheme. My reputation is worth more than that.

Thanks for the upload... however...

You display all the characteristics of a mlm junkie. You have links to 2 separate schemes in your write up and subsequent comment plus your username rather implies you are a Kleeneze agent as well...

Looks like you are hedging your bets that 1 of the other 2 pyramid schemes pays off as your current flavour of the month isn't...

Don't chase the lifestyle - get a proper job and buy nice stuff for the missus with the £1000s that you save by not signing up for every pyramid scam that you see advertised on the back windscreen of a battered old Ford Escort - have you not noticed that they only advertised on the back of very old cars? - usually parked in council estates and driven by disfunctional persons who can't hold down a normal job...

Your not a born again Christian as well are you... of for ***£%&""Q£!)$*^*^ sake!"
