A couple of years ago these disks started to be released onto the Amiga CD32 scene.

They contain many hundreds of full classic Amiga games which can be run from cool looking menus. They also contain Amiga scene demos and music.

To use the disks on a CD32 simply burn the image then put it in your CD32 and it will autoboot! These disks can also be used under WinUAE when running CD32 emulation.
