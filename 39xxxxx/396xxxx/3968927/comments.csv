Peerguardian is free and uses free internet updated IP block lists to filter out Time Warner, sony and other company's from connecting to your computer and prosecuting you later on with the facts that you have been sharing their shit!
Also filter out Anti-P2P company?s sending out corrupts data to the torrent hive to slow shit down. (plus governmental and educational institutions, advertising and reported malicious servers.)"
