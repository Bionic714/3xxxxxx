,TheGoose31,2008-03-22T15:42Z,"Hey there, I'm a big AC/DC uploader on YouTube (with 250+ videos, covering a few bootleg shows,  all of their officially released videos, etc.) If you could upload the .iso instead of DVDRips, I thin that would be great. Either way, I'll keep seeding at 200 K/sec for as long as needed."
