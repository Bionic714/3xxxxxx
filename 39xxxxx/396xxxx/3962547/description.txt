Movie Summary:

From the incredibly talented filmmakers of "The Witness", this deeply moving film explores the plight of farmed animals through the story of Gene and Lorri Bauston of Farm Sanctuary. Heartbreaking actual footage from factory farms, stockyards, and slaughterhouses is masterfully interwoven and juxtaposed with beautiful scenes from the sanctuary, as well as with rescue missions and intensely personal interviews with people who experienced first hand -- and ultimately rejected -- the painful realities of farm life. This film has the power to effect real change in people. Gather some friends and family to watch it, and by the end, there will not be a dry eye -- or untouched heart -- in the house.
