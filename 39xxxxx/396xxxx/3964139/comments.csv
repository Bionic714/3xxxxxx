You know that you're allowed to get better at this don't you?

ie: Better quality capping, encoding with XviD, etc, etc...

This is your eleventh go at it."

And Harry Q, if you don't like what darkpawt is kind enough to provide, cap the episodes yourself."
,Harry Q Hammer,2008-07-14T23:15Z,It's not rare you tit!
,Harry Q Hammer,2008-07-14T23:20Z,And if my encodes were this bad I'd shoot myself.
