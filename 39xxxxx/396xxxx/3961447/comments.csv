,Psylocke83,2008-04-07T12:32Z,"bobdel; yeah the original series was 220 episodes, although 136-220 were filler and not canon material.

Can you upload some of the original series? I lost all my anime (including the RAWs!!) when i left my old computer at some service place to place my harddrives into a new computer, those fucks.

Currently missing #15, #55, #57-63, #65-68, #70-75, #77-102, #105, #108-111, #115, #121,  #125-128, #130-133, #135 plus a bunch of the fillers starting from 136 but I can live without them.

If you or anyone who stumbles upon this have them, please share because I want a complete Naruto collection again and the original series is really hard to find now.. :(


Shippuuden has, when writing this, 54 episodes and it's pronounced Shiipuuden."
