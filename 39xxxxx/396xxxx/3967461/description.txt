Stolen from MovieX and uploaded here where it belongs.... NO IDEA about quality, I havn't had time to watch it yet.

Sorry about the Bitcomet padding, I want to use Bitcomet as a client, if anyone has any suggestions for a torrent maker, I am open to ideas.

A hilarious comedy about the lives of three broke losers who, by some 
strange twist of fate, land jobs with a very short-staffed Atlanta 
Police Department. In the line of duty, the new rookies become 
unlikely heroes after getting mixed up with some crazy dealings 
involving a diamond thief and two petty crooks, all the while trying 
to do what they can to keep their jobs.
