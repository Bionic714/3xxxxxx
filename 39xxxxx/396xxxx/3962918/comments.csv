,heffaklump,2008-01-05T19:34Z,"Is this the ""free 30 game trial""?"
,depiratenbaai,2008-01-05T20:33Z,"@heffaklump:
I don't torrent stuff thats freely available online at the publishers site :)

This setup is fully cracked and installs the FULL, REGISTERED version of Lux."
,hetreft,2008-01-17T21:31Z,IÂ´ve searched this for a while BIG thanks:)
,depiratenbaai,2008-01-18T02:35Z,"@hetreft:
This software is very rare. You are very welcome."
,Narjung,2008-01-21T02:28Z,I downloaded the 30 day trial and now when I try to play vs. the computer it just exits the game.
,projektdeth,2008-02-28T09:35Z,I installed and got it to work on XP. I can't seem to download any maps on a Vista computer though. It says there is an error downloading maps. Any suggestions?
,juleoel,2008-03-17T17:21Z,thx great game :)
,andromex82,2008-05-26T21:21Z,"Trying to download, but going slow, but then again I have been looking for this game for some time now, so I cant complain hehe"
,MastermuneX,2008-05-26T22:28Z,"If this acually works properly, then you good sir, ar my F***ing hero."
,alex_z00,2008-06-17T23:56Z,Can someone tell me how to register the name and serial number please??
,Masq,2008-06-21T13:06Z,"anyone knows, where to dl all the extra maps?"
,legin2,2008-06-22T20:09Z,You CANT download any other content.  No other maps or AI then.  
,legin2,2008-06-22T20:10Z,"This is not really a cracked version of the software.  The nfo file basically says ""make up your own registration number"".  But that doesnt work.  Whenever you try to download something from the game, you get a message saying that youre using a pirated version so cant download.  

Still, I dont think its a demo version.  Im pretty sure you can play as much as you want, but you just have to be content with the standard maps and AIs."
,smederewo,2008-09-27T17:06Z,can somebody crack vesion 5.72 pls;(  it is out for like 3 months or more
,perbotn,2008-10-10T09:16Z,THX!!!
,12X21,2008-10-26T23:36Z,cool thanks
,Dolphinski,2008-10-27T12:06Z,"Works absolutely fine for me. Install the program, overwrite the .jar file, run app. DO NOT UPDATE when asked. Goto File>enter registration, enter any name and copy and paste the serial from the text file that starts with 'de-xxxetc'. change SOME of the numbers in the serial (i changed one number by one digit in each section) and it works fine."
,polarbare14,2008-12-07T18:39Z,"Only true idiots would think that they could download some software illegally AND update it.

Sheez people.  Of course when you try to update your illegal software the company will disable it on your computer! Or revert it to demo or whatever.  Dumbasses.

Anyway...thanks for upping this and I will NOT be downloading content from the companies website...lol"
,tyroneasaurusrex,2008-12-19T07:47Z,"does anyone know where i can get this for mac? I NEED THIS BAD. my 30 game trial ran out and i need to play this game :(

or could someone give me a registration key please?"
,ariez88,2009-06-05T06:01Z,Does this torrent have any viruses like the other Lux Delux game here on TPB? Reply asap.
,miknos,2009-11-01T13:38Z,"Mac newest version (5.72):

,andres321,2010-08-30T09:59Z,"Great Download Speed!!!
Thx =D"
,dozer714,2010-11-01T03:08Z,"I have tried and failed at trying to do this right, I'm new at this so I just tried this as my first one I got it mounted and all I just don't know how to get the serial in correctly or things like that."
,rambo202,2010-12-01T10:27Z,Thank you. nice and simple to install.
,rambo202,2010-12-01T10:31Z,"Oh dozer you don't need to mount this. just double click the file LuxSetup. Once that is done copy the file LuxCore and paste it into the program file that will be in ""Harddisk-Programfiles-Lux"" let it overwrite the file there. then copy the blank cade from the ""serial"" text document and paste it into the game. change a few numbers and it should work."
,rambo202,2010-12-01T10:36Z,"Dozer you don't need to mount this. 

Just double click the file ""LuxSetup"". Let it install as normal.

Then copy the file ""LuxCore"" and paste it into the program file ""harddrive-Programfiles-Lux"" let it write over the original file. So you will now have replaced the original game file with the cracked version.

Then copy the generic serial code from the text document ""serial"" and paste it into the game. Change a few of the numbers on each section and it should work. 

DO NOT UPDATE......!!

I hope this helps."
,rambo202,2010-12-01T10:37Z,Sorry for putting that up twice my comp had a fit so i wrote it again LOL.
,jomn12,2012-03-24T18:46Z,"utorrent is giving me an error everytime i try to download this torrent. it says, ""Error: Former volume not mounted"" i cant download it at all. help please"
,jomn12,2012-03-25T06:09Z,"ok, I got Bittorrent and tried to download with it and its working just fine.  I must have just had some of my settings messed up on utorrent, preventing it from downloading."
,spawn3731,2012-05-04T09:28Z,Works as it should. Thanks!
