Book Description
================
Third-string Cleveland Browns quarterback Rick Dockery 
becomes the greatest goat ever by throwing three
 interceptions in the closing minutes of the AFC 
championship game. Fleeing vengeful fans, he finds 
refuge in the grungiest corner of professional football, 
the Italian National Football League as quarterback 
of the inept but full-of-heart Parma Panthers. What 
ensues is a winsome football fable, replete with team 
bonding and character-building as the underdog 
Panthers challenge the powerhouse Bergamo Lions 
for a shot at the Italian Superbowl. The book is also 
the author's love letter to Italy. Rick is first baffled 
and then enchanted by all things Italian-tiny cars! 
opera! benign corruption!-and through him Grisham 
(The Firm) instructs his readership in the art of gracious 
living, featuring sumptuous four-hour, umpteen-course 
meals. The writing sometimes lapses into travel-guide 
("most Italian cities are sort of configured around a 
central square, called a piazza") and food porn 
("the veal cutlets are beaten with a small bat, then 
dipped in eggs, fried in a skillet, and then baked in 
the oven with a mix of parmigiano cheese and stock 
until the cheese melts"), but it's invigorated by appealing 
characters and lively play-by-play. The result is a charming 
fish-out-of-water story.
