This fix is meant to eliminate any need for syncrosoft software!

Install:

1st
Update your Cubase Studio 4 to to the latest version.

2nd
32Bit OS:
Place synsoacc.dll to system32 directory

64Bit OS:
Place synsoacc.dll to SysWOW64 directory "Not compatible with Cubase 64bit patch"

And thats it!

Notice!
Only tested working under XP 32/64bit with Cubase Studio version 4.1.1 and Cubase SX 3.1.1.

Cubase 4.1.1 is still extremely bug filled if you recive any crashes/errors it's not due to this fix!

Heres two most common errors:
Rewire error:   remove rewire.dll from your system32 directory. this file is installed by gigastudio and for some reason cubase 4 doesn't like it.
Error relating to audioprimitives.opt:   Go to bios and disable Intel Speed Step, C1E or EIST or relative PowerNow! settings in AMD motherboards.

And please..
This is for trial/learning purpose only If you like the software then buy it!
Or in the case you just hate syncrosoft crap...

Enjoy!
