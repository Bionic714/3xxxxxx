same as before, I don't have the torrents for 1 or 7 so if anyone saved them, up that shit! there's still tons of peers"
,domino87,2008-01-04T06:27Z,man what happened to warcloud? did his shit get taken down or did he remove it himself?
,duderofthenight,2008-01-04T06:41Z,"Don't know what happened to him,but the pirate bay only takes down fake files, so..."
,truheart,2008-01-06T06:17Z,All of warcloud's  files were real. I was able to get all of them and have watched all of them. Who knows what happened. Maybe HBO got involved since they are known to monitor torrent sites 
,duderofthenight,2008-01-06T06:42Z,"Oh I wasn't implying they were fake... these are all the same files, same exact torrents even. Don't know why he deleted them, prolly cuz of assholes. I just reupped them since the swarm was still there, plus I was real baked and wanted to see if it'd work :D wish i'd wrote a proper description tho... Umm, it's a couple .wmvs from a dvdscr in cas anyones wondering."

,Porrfarfar,2008-01-07T12:13Z,"Man, if you got screeners for this great show, why donÂ´t you do a PROPER RIP!??!!"
,Senso,2008-01-07T13:06Z,OK the rips suck but at least put all of them. Ep 3 has been missing from all good torrent sites.
,Peterus,2008-01-07T18:01Z,"I may be misteaken, but these 1,2,5 & 6 ep's appear to be demo for reveiws. So they were probably supplied by HBO in such a poor video condition on purpose. They were afraid of these leaking... and it's obvious now, this fear had some base to it.
Ah... I just wish I could make myself wait week longer for ep2. But, this is stronger than me. I just... need... a fix... fast..."
,ein.grosses.pils,2008-01-08T20:16Z,"I'm with you Peterus.  One time, on HBO, they had this really popular show with all these uber-violent and sociopathic Italian-Americans from New Jersey.    The Wire started somewhere around then on HBO and no one paid attention.  But look at who's still stellar, huh?"
,markmissile,2008-01-09T02:28Z,somebody please help me find ep 3-4pleeeeeeeeeeasae
