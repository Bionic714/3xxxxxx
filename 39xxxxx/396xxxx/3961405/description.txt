n the 1990s, Alan Jackson was second only to Garth Brooks in country music popularity. Unlike Garth, he has continued to make best selling albums and Top 10 charting singles right up to now. Legacy's latest entry in its 16 Biggest series includes many of Jackson's best known songs, some of which are recognized beyond the confines of country: "Don't Rock the Jukebox," "Chattahoochee," "Gone Crazy," "Midnight in Montgomery." His first hit, "Here in the Real World," is included, as are his superb covers of Eddie Cochran's "Summertime Blues" and Jim Ed Brown's "Pop a Top." And let us not forget the timely satire of "Gone Country" and the populist sentiment of "Little Man." Jackson arrived on the scene in time for the "new traditionalist" movement and quickly staked his claim as the real thing, a worthy heir to the legacies left by Hank, Buck, Merle and George.
