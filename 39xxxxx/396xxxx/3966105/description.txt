"Yesterday I seeded for you, today you seed for others!" - Your uploading reminder.


I recommend people with hdtv's to go out of their way and purchase an upscale dvd player(s).  These do not enhance current dvd titles in your possession to "true" hd, but it sure as hell makes it look better, at the least, more pleasurable!  A website with insightful information is located here:

"Rise of the Video Game" is a five part series on The Discovery Channel about the history of video games.

Great dvd for gamers of all types!

My first torrent upload.  I have experimented with RatDVD software, though not bad, it is somewhat of a time hog when converting.
