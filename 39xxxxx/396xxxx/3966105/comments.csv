Thank you for uploading this, but please in the future, doing a dvd rip to a regular container format would be far superior, if you don't want to upload an uncompressed iso."
[T],spotswood,2008-12-03T09:20Z,I definitely know that for sure... this was my first torrent and was experimenting in the beginning of my uploading endeavors.

,thebiggerboat,2010-12-28T01:39Z,Please seed.  I'll keep it going indefinitely once I have it.
,thebiggerboat,2010-12-29T01:45Z,"Come on someone.  I'm down to the last 90mg and now there are no seeders?

Someone get me the last 90mg and I'll keep it up."
