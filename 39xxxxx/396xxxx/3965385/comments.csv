This is a Great torrent and the best AV product, but KM92's update server has MOVED!!
His host has shut down the server that this Update patch points too, so anyone using this as of now will NOT be getting updates past #2755 (current is #2759)

You need to remove the update server currently used and replace it with this one...http://eset.com.sapo.pt/ or you will no longer receive updates!

For anyone unfamiliar with the procedure:
1) Open ESET Interface in Advanced mode
2) Click ""Setup"" on the left
3) Click ""Enter Entire Advanced Setup Tree
4) Click ""Update"" in the setup tree popup window
5) Click the ""Edit"" radio button beside the Update Server dropdown
6) Highlight the current server URL in the Update Server List and click ""Remove""
7) Enter the above new URL in the upper field (Update Server line), and click ""Add""
8) This new URL should now be added to the lower field. OK out of this section and click ""Update"" on the left of the main window.
Now click the ""Update Virus Signature Database"" in the update section and it should now update to the latest definitions for you!

I post with KM92 at another site, and if this server URL should happen to change again I'll keep you updated. This update server made by KM92 is a temporary deal until the Nsane Fix V3 is finished and released. KM92 says he's gonna keep this server up forever, but the Nsane fix is (will be again) a more sure way to do this since it uses ESET update servers instead of a private server such as KM's.
I'm helping test the Nsane fix Beta's so I'll let you all know here when we have it stabilized and ready for release. ESET engineers have made it much more difficult to extend the trial period to unlimited as was done before, and so far it's been tougher to get the Fix to work in a completely stable manner."
