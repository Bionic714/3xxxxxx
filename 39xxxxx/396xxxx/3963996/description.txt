ConvertXtoDVD converts and burns your internet movie files to a Movie DVD.
It's a 1 click solution to convert your movie files to a Movie DVD playable on any old non DIVX/MP4 supported home DVD player.

You will not get a higher quality by converting to a bigger filesize!
It's usefully if your DVD Player do not support other formats as standard DVD's and (VCD-SVCD) playback to make movies compatible with old players.

Supports most popular format such Divx, Xvid, MOV, VOB, Mpeg, Mpeg4, AVI, WMV, DV and stream formats.
It converts your single files into a compliant DVD Video set of files and burns it on a DVD media.
The aspect ratio can be automatically selected or forced to a specific format.
The program works for NTSC and PAL video formats and creates chapters automatically.
Multiple audio tracks are supported.
The version 2 uses a completely rewritten interface with subtitles support and a lot of new settings.
