,bluffinbilly,2009-12-27T12:28Z,shit quality hubird? Upload a better fuckin torrent then!  Cheers rodney.
,kneebutt,2011-01-03T05:51Z,"Yeah, quality is garbage.  And before anyone else makes a stoopid comment about uploading a better quality version - if I had a decent quality version I wouldn't be here trawling through these crappy low quality torrents, dumbass.  Get your mum to explain it to ya."
,CDLX5342,2011-08-08T06:13Z,"cool, thanks rodney! ...and @Hubird & kneebutt, I think what bluffinbilly was trying to say is : don't complain about something that is free! :P thanks again for the up, Jebediah are great!"
,CDLX5342,2011-08-08T06:19Z,"having downloaded this I can verify the quality is not too bad at all. If you want studio quality go elsewhere, but if you are listening to it on your computer, you probably won't be able to tell the difference unless you have a high end sound system! people need to keep in mind the original recording of this album wasn't the highest budget ever! :P thanks again rodney! :D"
