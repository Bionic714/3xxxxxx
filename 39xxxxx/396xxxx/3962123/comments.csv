,culiptist,2008-01-06T07:14Z,"I download the ""Windows Vista x86 MultiLang + Crack + AutoPatcher"" torrent and thought that it was poorly described with unclear directions and the crack that was choosen wasn't to user friendly.  The one I provide is a trusted source and is very simple just one click and reboot. Unfortuantly these days people aren't to computer literate (for many reasons), so making things as easy as possible will draw attention.  Which is (and should be) one major concern for anyone who chooses to upload torrents.  Otherewise people just won't download and you have wasted your time.  "

i initially got this so i can test out vista and see if i like it if i do then i go buy it, wel lafter all the hassel i had with this im gonna go buy it anyway and do it properly.
thanks anyway"
,culiptist,2008-01-11T07:55Z,"adbp1

I almost positive that your problem may just be the hard drive.  The crack nor this vista iso would do anything to corrupt your hard drive. Not only that every thing in this torrent is a copy of known good torrents.  I only created this torrent because of how long it took me to find something that works.  I just thought that it would help people find what there looking for easier.  Also, most vista torrents don't give too much discription on what there providing which is really stupid.  So far the my torrent seems to be doing very well seeing how it was only upload 6 days ago.  If anyone has gotten this to work for them please let us know!"

By the looks of you laptop specs it seems that you should be able to run any version of vista that you wish.  In my opinion I would choose the Ultimate version not only for the enhanced security features, but also for bragging rights.  Just you for your own interest I have provided links below to the pages which I used to answer your question.  That way you can read it directly from the horsesmouth.

Thanks!  Another thing to keep in mind is that most people that download this torrent will be from Europe and Asia, so during the day time don't expect them to seed to outragiously."
