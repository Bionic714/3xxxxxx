Directions:

1.  Burn "Windows.Vista.All.Editions.32bit.Multi.Lang.Retail.Version.uif"
to dvd. I used magicISO to burn this.  Here is the link of what I used if you need to download it          

"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3917782/Magic_ISO_Maker_5.4_with_serial"

2. Save "Vista.All.x86.OneClick.Activator-CLoNY.exe" file on to a flash drive or some where so that it won't get deleted when installing vista.  I just saved it onto a seperate partion. 

Note for next step: I highly suggest not upgrading a system and just format and install a fresh copy of Vista. Also check this page "http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/editions/systemrequirements.mspx" to determine which version will run best on your machine.  

3. Boot from disc.  When asked to enter product key "DO NOT ENTER KEY!"  Just click "Next" then click "NO" that you do not want to enter a key.  If you do enter a key reboot and reinstall, because the crack will not work if you enter a key.  

3. Once installed and logged in run the "Vista.All.x86.OneClick.Activator-CLoNY.exe". After it finishes installing it will ask you to "Press any key to reboot." So press enter and reboot.  

4. The only thing left to do is log in and click on the windows "new" start button on the bottom left and right click on computer.  Then select "properties". On that window look at the bottom for "Windows Activation".  Give it a little time to load but it will eventually say "Windows is activated"

5. Explore your new OS. 

If this worked for you please leave a comment with at least a ":)" to let people know that it worked for you. I would appreciate it.
