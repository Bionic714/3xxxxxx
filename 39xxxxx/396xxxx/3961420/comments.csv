,madmax999,2008-10-05T17:05Z,You're welcome.  I have some more like this coming up.
,madmax999,2008-10-25T17:19Z,The earlier movie is called Ball of Fire.  I just realized I mentioned it and then forgot to post it.  What a maroon.  It will be posted today.
,thew78,2010-05-28T22:58Z,Thankyou all but please seed!
,editrx,2010-11-30T01:40Z,"I'm so grateful you uploaded this, madmax -- this and Ball of Fire are such unknown gems, I think everyone should see them!

Now if only I could get more than one seed off this ... sigh.

(At least one person, perhaps you, are seeding this -- everywhere else I've looked, it says it's seeding, but lies! all lies! :D )"
,madmax999,2011-02-28T20:59Z,"yah, it probably is just me seeding, or at least regularly seeding.  Eventually it will dl completely.  With only a couple exceptions, i only seed the movies that i upload since so many of them have a limited demand.  However, i do constantly rotate them through an 8 movie queue.  I have to throttle the speed down during the day but i open it up at night.

Thank you everyone for the kind comments"
