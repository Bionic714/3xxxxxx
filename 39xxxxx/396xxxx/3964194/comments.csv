,fissionessence,2008-01-25T03:08Z,"Thanks! This is the kind of book you want to read but not buy, because the information is interesting but not reusable. 

Now I just wish I could find a pdf of the next book ? Wizards Presents: Worlds and Monsters. :(

,andoroido,2008-03-02T18:58Z,"No guilt torrenting this. They want to charge US$20 for this?! It's like paying to read an advertisement, or buying tickets to see a movie trailer! 
Isn't this info all going to be part of the Rulebook when it comes out in June? I'll want a hradcopy of THAT, but not this."
,hitnruni95,2008-03-16T05:47Z,"Damn right. It *is* an advertisement. 20 dollars. Each.

Wizards pricing models have been nonsense for years. It's like they're afraid that if they make the books too reasonably priced, non-dorks and girls might play too, then DND players might discover sex and social lives and the whole industry would collapse."
