With a variety of their songs featuring references to contemporary musical and cultural icons like Pearl Jam, Ally McBeal, and Madonna, the Texas band Lonestar was one of the mid-1990s' biggest country music acts. This best-of features cuts from throughout the band's career, including their first hits "Tequila Talkin'" and "No News," the cute "Unusually Unusual," and the sensitive ballad "I'm Already There."
