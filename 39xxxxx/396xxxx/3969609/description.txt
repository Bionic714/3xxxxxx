Doug Kershaw may be old enough to be my great-grandfather, but he rocks harder than anyone else I've ever seen!  He played hard and fast before anyone ever heard of heavy metal.  He literally "shreds" on every performance...his violin bows are practically destroyed.

Highly recommended!  You won't believe the last number!
