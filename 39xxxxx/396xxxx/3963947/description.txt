Talking Time Keeper (TTK) is a program encompassing a wide range of useful time and date related features. As the name suggests, TTK also has the ability to use built in real life sampled voices, both male and female to tell you the time and/or date, either at the click of a button, or at specified intervals. It also comes complete with an easy to use Voice Builder tool, so you can make your own voices to include in TTK. All you need a microphone! TTK is not lacking in the visual department either, with it's beautiful state of the art animated interface. You also have the option of downloading extra skins for TTK's
