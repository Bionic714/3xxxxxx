The TimD Series - Chapter Four

The incomplete but incomparable 2CD soundboard from the night of John Bonham's 25th Birthday, at the Forum, Inglewood, CA.

This show is an exception to AUD boots being my favorites, for a lot of reasons.  There are some hilarious Plantations, for one.  Not to mention a pretty hot performance.  I try not to compare shows - for a guy like me who's never seen Zeppelin, they're all damn good.  This one is better than most, even for a soundboard.  You soundboard lovers will effing love this one.

If you've never bothered to pick up a bootleg, and I don't blame you if you haven't, this is the one that you should start your collection with.  This (along with perhaps 08.31.69 - keep your eyes open for that one later in the series) is one of the most accessible shows out there - it doesn't require what us old-heads call "Bootleg Ears" to listen to, and it won't give you a headache from concentrating to hear through the tape hiss of generation after generation of cassette-to-cassette copies.  You'll hear a band at its finest, in Los Angeles where they always played hotter, louder and longer, rocking the Forum over two full CDs.  Guys and gals, the original vinyl on this set will run you $95+, if you can find it, which you won't.
