NERO 8 ULTRA EDITION *PROPER* (C) AHEAD

Nero 8 introduces the newly-designed Nero StartSmart
user interface, which maximizes user efficiency with a
one-stop solution for creating and managing digital
media projects. With this new interface, prime
functions like burning and ripping audio and data
discs can now be accessed directly, letting users
projects with one-click functions. Nero 8 also
supports a number of next-generation formats with
editing, playback, and burning features. In addition,
Nero 8 lets users edit photo slide shows and create
High Definition video in both Blu-ray BD-AV and HD DVD
video formats.

In addition, Nero RescueAgent has been developed and
integrated based on Nero customer feedback, and allows
users to restore deleted files and recover data from
CDs and DVDs that may have been lost due to scratched
discs, interrupted recording operations, or poor
recording quality.

Nero 8 has been optimized for use with the new Windows
Vista operating system and offers a variety of features
that complement Windows Vista including the Nero
DiscCopy gadget, which lets users copy a disc with just
one click in the Windows Vista sidebar. Nero 8 also
provides a complete bundle of multimedia and backup and
recovery features not found in Windows Vista alone. The
addition of live icons allows users to see what is in a
file without opening it, and a Rich Preview pane offers
direct access to files from within the Windows Explorer
browser.

SPECIAL NOTE: Happy anniversary honey!

Well the FiCKDiEBiATCH was a version released on
rapidshare with a serial from a russian forum. The
timestamp there is 08:56 08-09-2007 GMT+4 which
clearly predates the release, and the same serial
is posted. The post there mentions it came from a
Chinese website called VDOWN, but we dont understand
a word of that site..

Anyway, noone likes p2p crap and everybody likes
keygens! Big thanks to our friends at EMBRACE again
for their outstanding work, as always.
