_____________________________________________________________Summary__

Reporter Gwynne Roberts joins Kurdish doctor Khasrow Ihsan in the 
search for the mass graves of 8,000 men, women and children murdered 
by Saddam Hussein in the early years of his regime.

After the Iran/Iraq war, Saddam's revenge against the Kurdish Barzani
clan for siding with Iran was swift and brutal. Now the regime's 
obsession with keeping accurate records of its own crimes can help 
put together the case against the deposed dictator at his trial in 
Baghdad. As well as collecting written documentation, Dr Ihsan is 
trying to locate the mass graves to use as evidence of Saddam's 
crimes. The driving force behind his quest is the grieving relatives
and surviving members of the Barzani clan and the search is 
authorised by Masoud Barzani, clan leader and now president of the 
Kurdish region of Iraq.

In spite of the dangers of the expedition, the lack of cooperation
from the Sunni locals and the frustration of a fruitless search, 
five months later the mass graves are finally located.
