I know this is freeware but i thought it would be easier if I uploaded this so people  could download everything all together instead of going to all the different places.

This torrent includes everything you need to start ripping with Exact Audio Copy to Flac and MP3.

Exact Audio Copy is a so called audio grabber for audio CDs using standard CD and DVD-ROM drives. The main differences between EAC and most other audio grabbers are :

    * It is free (for non-commercial purposes)
    * It works with a technology, which reads audio CDs almost perfectly. If there are any errors that can?t be corrected, it will tell you on which time position the (possible) distortion occurred, so you could easily control it with e.g. the media player

With other audio grabbers you usually need to listen to every grabbed wave because they only do jitter correction. Scratched CDs read on CD-ROM drives often produce distortions. But listening to every extracted audio track is a waste of time. Exact Audio Copy conquer these problems by making use of several technologies like multi-reading with verify and AccurateRip.

THIS TORRENT INCLUDES A READ ME FILE WHICH TELLS YOU HOW TO START RIPPING WITH EAC.  IT ALSO COMES WITH SOME PRESET PROFILES SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO VERY MUCH WORK.  IT WILL ALL MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD.
