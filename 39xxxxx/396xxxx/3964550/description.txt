 *  LIFEFORCE is another great film by Tobe Hooper. The     *
 *  movie centers around a group of astronauts who come     *
 *  across a spaceship inhabited by "hibernating" space-    *
 *  vampires. One crew-member returns from the excursion    *
 *  alive, and so does one of the space-vamps. Luckily for  *
 *  us guys, it's the amazingly gorgeous Mathilda May, who  *
 *  spends all of her on-screen time butt-naked (YAY!!!).   *
 *  She is so spell-bindingly fantastic to look at, that I  *
 *  think I had to watch the film 3 times to pay attention  *
 *  to the plot. LIFEFORCE is a very original take on the   *
 *  whole vampire idea, and has some really cool effects    *
 *  that still stand up to this day. The whole story is     *
 *  interesting and well played, and is a film that I watch *
 *  on a pretty regular basis (and not just for the hot     *
 *  naked chick). Definitely worth checking out.            *

 * Cover Synopsis:                                          *
 *  From the director of Poltergeist and co-wrtier of Alien *
 *  comes a thrilling sci-fi adventure of explosive action  *
 *  and pulse-pounding suspense. With mind-blowing special  *
 *  effects (for 1985) by Oscar-winner John Dykstra,        *
 *  Lifeforce is a sci-fi extravaganza that delivers        *
 *  out-of-this-world excitement. A mission to investigate  *
 *  Halley's Comet discovers an even more fascinating       *
 *  phenomenon: an alien spacecraft! After a deadly         *
 *  confrontation, the aliens travel to Earth where their   *
 *  seductive leader begins a terrifying campaign to drain  *
 *  the lifeforce of everyone she encounters. Her victims,  *
 *  in turn, continue the cycle, and soon the entire        *
 *  planet is in mortal danger.                             *
