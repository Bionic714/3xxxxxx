,Kyrose,2009-01-07T21:46Z,"@Captain_Seasick: Wow, here you are downloading movies illegally and you're complaining about a high quality movie with subtitles? Turn it off, fuckwit. If you can't then deal with it. You should be happy someone is uploading it."

,Phrosty12,2009-02-24T17:25Z,"@Kyrose:  Don't be a fuck, bringing that bullshit argument on ""illegal sharing."" Captain_Seasick's right, things should be tagged properly. If it IS crap, then I'll just get it from one of the many other sources who has uploaded it."
