Show Notes:
- 'Petrified' verse 1 was over 'Points Of Authority'.
- This was the first time LP performed in China.
- LP uses the 'Breaking the Habit' intro from early 2007 at this show instead of the newer one they've been doing since the later parts of Projekt Revolution 2007.

Other Notes:
- The first 5 songs are the downloadable bonus content of the 'Minutes To Midnight South East Asia Tour Edition' CD.
- Released by LPLive.net
