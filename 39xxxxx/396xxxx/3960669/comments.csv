,Kenzo78,2008-01-05T16:10Z,Doesnt work for me :(
,splitside69,2008-01-05T17:18Z,what happened kenzo? I tested it on all OS above and it worked. It did not start on vista still.
,Kenzo78,2008-01-06T15:28Z,"When installed I only get a black screen for 2 seconds, and then it just shows my desktop again. Tried starting it from DOS and XP Pro. Nothing helps. When tried from DOS it said I needed a CD. :) I laughed a bit, but then got annoyed since you seem to have made it work on several OS. So dont know what is wrong."
,splitside69,2008-01-06T21:31Z,"OOOOkkkk...  hey man sorry about that, to be honest I've installed it on 4 computers (including mines wich are on Xp and Vista) and it worked flawlessly under XP with directX 9.0c... maybe a conflict with another of your programs. This is an old rip I have since like 2000 and it worked well all those years :P"
