The unimaginable happens. Sayuri is pronounced 'dead' by her doctor, 
but her body continues to function. Her wounds begin to fester and her body begins to rot. 
Her once loving mother, father and sister are repulsed as their home starts reeking of decomposing 
flesh. Unable to bear it any longer, they corner Sayuri holding a can of gasoline....
She flees for her life, and thinks she has escaped them, but she's wrong....
