Remove the torrent, re-encode this one trhisdone. The quality is very good, but it should have the correct aspect ratio."

,trhisdone,2008-02-05T04:47Z,This movie is being seeded. If you don't like how it looks I suggest you get the dvd and encode it yourself. The tools and information on how to do it are all free.

For one, the screen resolution is definition wide screen. For two, if you would have seen the movie, you would know that the intro sequence is in a pseudo full screen format to simulate the television show. When the show title is displayed, Professor Frink (had to look up the name) flies through the screen with a banner that says ""MOVIE."" When he gets to the other side of the screen, the MOVIE, takes over the traditional wide screen aspect ratio.

Don't be such a dick behind your computer, man. Thank you uploader."
