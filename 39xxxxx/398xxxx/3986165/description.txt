It looks like someone snuck a camcorder into a Scientology orientation. This story and the video broke on Digg, then a bunch of the article's comments were removed with this message "[This comment is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Church of Scientology International]". Scary. The video was hosted at a few other sites, including Google Video, but was taken down immediately. I recorded the streaming video and will seed it for as long as possible. Watch this video and share it, people need to know the truth about this cult.

By the way, please seed for as long as you can too.
