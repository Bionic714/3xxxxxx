,BrotherNo1,2008-01-19T12:12Z,"I'd pick up the baton but don't have access to the audio version - from where do you get it?

Happy to spread it around.

,kindbyname,2008-01-19T14:19Z,"Same here! If someone supplies the audio I can supply a crapload of bandwidth. Always happy to keep something like this going.
Keep up the good work!"
,worldwhitenoise,2008-01-19T16:02Z,"I inputted three trackers when making this torrent, although when I now check on it in by bitcomet client...just one - the udp tracker listed on the upload page.

had a curious incident midweek when all my bitcomet settings were lost after a long uptime then restart...

,sweedishmetal,2008-02-07T22:54Z,"Even though I subscribe to the print version of The Economist, I listened to this for the first time last week and it's great.  However it took over a week to download because the maximum download rate was only 3kbs.  Can someone unthrottle their upload rate?  Or if not, I'm on broadband at 6mbs, and I'd be willing to seed the original if I knew how to get it.  Anyway, thanks again - it's a productive way to make use of my commute."
,sweedishmetal,2008-02-07T23:00Z,"Okay, I just checked this out at http://www.economist.com/audioedition/ and they sell each full issue on audio for $8.00.

If anyone is already a subscriber and would like me to download and seed, let me know.

I'd subscribe myself, but I just renewed my print copy subscription in December, so it's only a luxury for me at this point, not a necessity.

Thanks -"
