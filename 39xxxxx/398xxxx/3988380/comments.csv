After five years of intensive and controversial probing, an inquiry into rampant sexual abuse in Cornwall, Ont. has not reached a firm conclusion about whether or not a pedophile ring was at work in the eastern Ontario city.

Commissioner Normand Glaude's 1600-page report made numerous intricate observations about the credibility of alleged pedophiles and their victims, but declined to answer the central question that led to it being set up by the Ontario government in 2005.

?Throughout this inquiry I have heard evidence that suggested that there were cases of joint abuse, passing of alleged victims, and possibly passive knowledge of abuse,? he wrote.

?I want to be very clear that I am not going to make a pronouncement on whether a ring existed or not.?

However, Commissioner Glaude did fault a slew of government and police officials for not taking complaints of sexual abuse seriously, bunging investigations and allowing pedophiles to either escape detection or simply continue abusing youths.

He also criticized a lack of research and organization that went into the launch of Project Truth ? a major Ontario Provincial Police investigation into allegations that a ?clan? of pedophiles were operating in Cornwall.

These investigative shortcomings were exacerbated by the actions of a rogue Cornwall Police Officer ? Constable Perry Dunlop ? whose distrust of the police hierarchy was so extreme that he mounted a one-man crusade to expose sexual abuse in the community, Commissioner Glaude concluded.

He also found that Cornwall Police provided misinformation to the community about sexual abuse investigations, helping fuel an atmosphere of suspicion, rumour and fear.

In one instance, for example, he found that police failed to instigate a proper investigation into pornographic photographs found during a raid of a Cornwall man.

In another incident, staff at the Cornwall Probation Office failed to draw attention to two colleagues who had apparently been abusing youths under their supervision. Commissioner Glaude said that their silence was rooted in feelings of intimidation, office politicking, and an overriding concern that the two men would create administrative trouble by filing labour grievances.

Rivalries and mistrust within the provincial probation office in Cornwall led to information about sexual assaults not being freely exchanged, he said.

?This was a significant problem,? Commissioner Glaude said. ?It is my recommendation that training on sexual abuse, particularly male victimization, should be mandatory for all probation officers in the province,? Commissioner Glaude concluded.

In a series of devastating conclusions about the Cornwall Community Police Service, Commissioner Glaude said that officers failed to adequately investigate sex abuse claims that had began to pile up in the 1980s.

He said that they were also insensitive to complainants, criticizing the force for not keeping victims apprised of the progress of investigations and criminal charges brought against their assailants; for not providing counselling to victims; and for not using all the evidence at their disposal against those who were charged.

He recommended that, in future, the force require officers to properly record their notes during investigations and that they report abuse allegations to child welfare authorities to prevent the victimization of other children and youths.

Judge Glaude said that investigation into the growing number of sex abuse allegations was hampered by a host of problems, including the fact that many officials harboured doubts about sexual assault complainants in past decades; institutional structures were not in place to encourage victims to come forward; documents and records disappeared; many complainants had a difficult history of substance abuse; and the nature of memory often militated against the credibility of complainants.

Commissioner Glaude noted yesterday that the complainant clearly exaggerated and even falsified many of the events he described ? that that he recanted a number of them in testimony before the inquiry.

Within the community, reaction to Judge Glaude's recommendations and findings are expected to polarized and intense.

?This inquiry had a particularly tortuous journey and the commissioner could have received much better guidance from his legal staff,? said University of Ottawa professor Ed Ratushny, author of a recently published book, The Conduct Of Public Inquiries. ?But a lot of that will be overlooked if the report rings true, is fair and brings closure to the entire matter.?"
