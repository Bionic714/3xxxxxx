I also realize there is a larger, full quality version of this episode being torrented, but it is taking a long time to seed out (at this very moment, the one and only seed is presently offline). This smaller version is intended mostly as an interim measure, so that people can watch it while they wait for the better one: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3984104/"
