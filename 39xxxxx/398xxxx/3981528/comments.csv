,evo2k8,2008-05-30T10:20Z,"Hi All

Please forward this on, if you don't drive forward it to someone who
does. Who knows maybe we can have an impact!
We are hitting £1.25 a litre in some areas now, soon we will be faced
with paying £1.50 a litre. Well over £6 a gallon for the older
readers!!

Fuel WILL cost £2.00 per litre by September 2008...

As a result, everything else is costing more, too.
Philip Hollsworth offered this good idea:
This makes MUCH MORE SENSE than the 'don't buy petrol on a certain day
campaign that was going around last April or May! The oil companies
just laughed at that because they knew we wouldn't continue to hurt
ourselves by refusing to buy petrol. It was more of an inconvenience
to us than it was a problem for them. BUT, whoever thought of this
idea, has come up with a plan that can really work.
Please read it and join in!
Now that the oil companies and the OPEC nations have conditioned us to
think that the cost of a litre is CHEAP, we need to take aggressive
action to teach them that BUYERS control the market place not sellers.
With the price of petrol going up more each day, we consumers need to
take action. The only way we are going to see the price of petrol come
down is if we hit someone in the pocket by not purchasing their
Petrol! And we can do that WITHOUT hurting ourselves.
Here's the idea:
For the rest of this year DON'T purchase ANY petrol from the two
biggest oil companies (which now are one), ESSO and BP.
It's easy to make this happen. Just forward this email, and buy your
petrol at Shell, Asda,Tesco, Sainsburys, Morrisons Jet etc. i.e.
boycott BP and Esso
If they are not selling any petrol, they will be inclined to reduce
their prices. If they reduce their prices, the other companies will
have to follow suit. But to have an impact we need to reach literally
millions of Esso and BP petrol buyers. It's really simple to do!!
Now, don't wimp out at this point... keep reading and I'll explain how
simple it is to reach millions of people!!
I am sending this note to a lot of people. If each of you send i t to
at least ten more (30 x 10 = 300)... and those 300 send it to at least
ten more (300 x 10 = 3,000) .... and so on, by the time the message
reaches the sixth generation of people, we will have reached over
THREE MILLION consumers! If those three million get excited and pass
this on to ten friends each, then 30 million people will have been
contacted! If it goes one level further, you guessed it.. ... THREE
HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE!!!
Again, all You have to do is send this to 10 people. That's all. (and
not buy at ESSO/BP) How long would all that take? If each of us sends
this email out to ten more people within one day of receipt, all 300
MILLION people could conceivably be contacted within the next 8days!!!
Acting together we can make a difference . If this makes sense to you,
please pass this message on.
PLEASE HOLD OUT UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO THE 69p a LITRE RANGE
It's easy to make this happen. Just forward this email, and buy your
petrol at Shell, Asda,Tesco, Sainsburys, Morrisons Jet etc. i.e.
boycott BP and Esso
Get Started!
