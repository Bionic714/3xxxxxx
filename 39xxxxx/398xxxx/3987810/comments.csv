Looking forward to the next days!!

Thanks! "
,joem35,2008-01-22T21:46Z,Definately! We really appreciate this. Lets make sure we thank the guy and not take his generosity for granted.
,Herlock,2008-01-23T13:00Z,"JSTV changed codes.. :(
Any problems you too, zlo666?

Greetings from Russia :)"
,zlo666,2008-01-23T19:08Z,"Yup, keys are the problem :)
Post a note here if you find the new ones.
"
,jbnt,2008-01-23T20:47Z,"zo, what do you mean by keys,  If  I can help, I will.  Thanks for the postings so far.  does this mean you cant post days 9-11??"
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-01-23T23:06Z,"I know the LITE file is nothing, not even close, to what ZLO does for us. But if no one has the full days, the screen grab I have is not bad. I have tweaked the encoder. It is in Japanese but at least you get to see the results.

Thanks again ZLO for all you do for us world wide! BTW, is Joe still on for his COMCAST of the next BASHO? Thanks in advance JOE for stepping up!"
,joem35,2008-01-24T01:15Z,"I'll let you know if the comcast thing pans out. If it doesn't, there are two website that i know of that offer complete bashos on dvds. The sets are $50 each for 15 days. I've bought some and the quality is good. They make new ones after each basho.

,zlo666,2008-01-25T07:40Z,"@jbnt:
That means no sumo for the moment, hopefully next bash things will be better.
Bye."
,fruitjam,2008-01-25T11:35Z,"Well zlo666, it was good while it lasted and I really thank you for what was received! I still have not been able to watch the end of the Aki Basho from 2007. And if you still have the days 10, 12-15 i am still sitting in expectation with these torrents loaded in my azureus :-) It would be nice to see the finals of at least one of the last bashos :-)

Thanks again for your efforts!

Regards 
fruitjam"
,jbnt,2008-01-25T13:19Z,Thanks again for what you have done.  Hope things go better in march...J&T
,cptnemo55,2008-01-31T21:57Z,"Thank you to everyone who is involved with getting  sumo out on the net

As you can tell, it really means alot to many people all around the world...

Please keep it up!"
,joem35,2008-02-15T06:25Z,"zlo666...let me know what the deal is on the March Basho as soon as you know. I don't think comcast is going to work out in my area, so if no one is posting, maybe I'll just buy a set and post it. I'd rather not, since its $50, but if you can't get the signal, I can probably get a set within a week of the basho ending. 
joe"
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-02-22T13:29Z,2 weeks to go to the next basho. any good news on the signal zlo or are we going to have to go matches only in japanese? thanks much!
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-02-26T19:40Z,"The ""banzuke"" or official listing of rank for the March Grand Sumo Tournament (March 9th-23rd) has been released.
Keep an eye out for our regular pre-tournament interview section.

[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-02-28T17:23Z,"Not trying to make this the BLOG of sumo but ZLO or Joe or anyone else, does anyone look like they can post the next basho in english full or lite?"
,joem35,2008-02-28T23:31Z,"As i said earlier, if zlo can't post anything, I'll buy a complerte set (15 days) and post it once I get it. This would probably be a week or two after the actual basho ends. Better than nothing. Once zlo chimes in, then I can plan accordingly.
Joe"
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-03-02T03:35Z,"Thanks JOE. Does anyone else on the planet have access to the broadcast in english? Does ZLO have the new SAT codes? I hate to wait and plan to web grab the LITE off the FRENCH site each day but not the same as full show or even in English. So, anyone, with a week to go, how are we looking. Sumo starved and hungry for more... SciFi-Sumo out!"
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-03-13T22:00Z,"Hey JOE. If you can stand Japanese and VERY SMALL video, you can get each day free live. I am working on grabbing it off the webcast each day and posting. When I say small, I mean small! About 2""x2"" big. But it will be start to finish each day. I have the LITE up for the first 5 days of the HARU also. Thanks all for all the help! SciFi-Sumo!"
,joem35,2008-03-14T03:08Z,"Nah, I'm waiting for basho to be over and then I'll get the full set with English play by play. If enough people want to see the full 15 days, I'll post them when I get the set. Post a comment here if you wnat me to make the set available. 
Joe"
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-03-14T03:29Z,I have contact COMCAST about adding TV JAPAN. It will set me back $170 for the year but I can then do the full show like ZLO has done in the past. I am thinking about it for the next BASHO as a test. I like the FRENCH stuff but not the same as in English and the full show! We will keep in touch!
,joem35,2008-03-14T05:44Z,"yeah, doesn't seem like my area is carrying it. At least right now. I'd pay $170, but that's me.
Let me know what you decide. As far as this basho, I'll be getting a set.
Joe"
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-03-14T14:12Z,"All right JOE and everyone. I am going to do it for all of us. I am going today to get my box and add TV JAPAN and will do what ZLO has been doing. I will not do the LITE anymore due to time. I will do the start to finish each day BASHO and upload it. I will need SEED help everyone as my upload via comcast is just 385k. It would add $500 a year to get a 2meg upload line. Not going there. So, I hope, after today, I will be posting DVD quality full hour each day at my TPB link:

http://thepiratebay.org/user/SciFi-Sumo/"
,joem35,2008-03-14T17:46Z,"Sounds good. Much appreciated. I'll still be posting a DVD quality set of this basho at the end of the month, for those interested."
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-03-14T22:12Z,"Hey JOE or ZLO. What a day. My TiVo took a dump while hooking up the COMCAST box for the NHK. Got to get it up to save the video. Next, can not get the ENGLISH audio for the SUMO. Have it changed in my COMCAST box but still just Japanese. Any ideas from JOE or ZLO on how to get the ENGLISH audio to be the default? Thanks! Will keep you up to date but not good so far!"
,joem35,2008-03-15T06:43Z,"I'm not familiar with Tivo, but a quick search shows that channel setting can be adjusted here:
TiVo Messages & Setup -> Settings -> Preferences -> Customize Channels 

Note, various DVD series may have a slightly different menu set up, but it's basically in preferences. Hope this helps.
Joe"
,joem35,2008-03-15T06:58Z,whoops...i meant various Tivo series.
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-03-15T11:42Z,"Hi Joe. Thanks. It is not my TiVo. I just spent ALL DAY yesterday learning TiVo Linux and cloning my one unit software over to my other. Now TiVo is happy so I should be able to at least get the rest of the BASHO in Japanese. The problem is the COMAST box. Even if I change the setting for LANGUAGE from DEFAULT to ENGLISH or even SPANISH or anything else, they still speak Japanese. According to COMCAST I have to speak to TV JAPAN about it, not there issue. According to DISH people, their box has a choice for AUDIO MAIN or AUDIO 2nd that we need. Now I am not ready to JUMP to DISH for this, but if anyone outhere knows how to set COMCAST BOX to work let me know. Thanks!"
,joem35,2008-03-15T17:02Z,"It may not be the box, but the channel itself, which may be in Japanese only. I suggest you contact TVJapan through their website and ask if the package they sold comcast was for japanese or english or both. Also, if it includes english, call comcast back. Most folks in customer service have no idea what they are talking about and give out erroneous information."
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-03-15T17:40Z,"I'm with you Joe. Yes. Monday I will call both TV Japan and COMCAST. Each broadcast of SUMO states that ENGLISH is on AUDIO 2. So it IS there, just have to get it. However, my old TiVo is DEAD. Can not get past the boot up even with the load of my other unit. I have a new one on the way but can not record the BASHO until it gets here in a few days. Ah well, I will LITE each day until then and work on the last few days to test quality and feedback to be 100% ready for the SUMMER Basho! Thanks Joe and all!"
,Herlock,2008-03-17T14:51Z,"Thanx, SciFi-Sumo, for your titanic efforts.
We are waiting for your victory! :)
Full 2-hour show in good quality like zlo releases would be great."
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-03-17T17:51Z,"Thank you Herlock. This has not been much fun getting it done! I just hate not being able to do ""my sumo""! ( he he he ). I just had COMCAST ""reboot"" and update my box remote and they ""say"" that should take care of my audio issue. I don't think it will and they just do this to make you go away. I talked to TV JAPAN and they say buzz off. We broadcast in ENGLISH and JAPANESE so it is not their issue, call COMCAST. I will see later today if the update worked and I can get ENGLISH. If not I will post JAPANESE when I get my new TiVo and keep working on the ENGLISH. Again, if anyone knows of a fix let me know here or in my posts of the LITE sumo. Thanks world! I just want my sumo to share with the world..... "
,Herlock,2008-03-17T22:14Z,"Sci-Fi Sumo, Japanese will be good, even you can't get English. Good quality is the best thing.
Good luck!
Waiting for news from you."
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-03-20T01:07Z,"ZLO is back ( well sorta ) I am posting the FULL DAY now. Here is day 11.

[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-03-21T00:43Z,"I hope, ( looking good joe ) to have day 13,14 & 15 all posted in English DVD quality and all. For now day 11 & 12 are up with Japanese. Enjoy all!"

[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-03-21T16:50Z,"What do you think JOE so far? Hey ZLO, happy I can return the favor after all you work so far? BTW, ZLO, what software did you use to make your AVI files? Thanks!"
,joem35,2008-03-22T08:13Z,"sorry, not watching them. waitin to buy the 15 day set (dyin..but waitin). maybe next basho everything will go off on your end without a hitch. :)"
[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-03-22T19:10Z,Hi Joe. O.K. I will say nothing but it is as always a GREAT Basho! You will enjoy it. So far so good. All looks great for May Basho. I am tinkering with DivX or AVI files. So far DivX looks like the winner. Good quality and size. I would love to know if ZLO is watching and what he used to make his files in AVI if he is still around. Thanks!
,joem35,2008-03-25T07:03Z,"i've sent away for the 15 set. i hope to have it this weekend or early next week and will start posting once i get it.
joe"
,joem35,2008-03-30T18:57Z,"As promised, i am seeding the complete day 1 of the haru basho. I'd appreciate comments on the quality. I'll make it available until there are enough seeders to take over. I will also make any full days avilable that scifisumo was unable to.
