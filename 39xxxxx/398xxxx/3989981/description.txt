Let It All Out (4:56)---------------------------------------------------------------S'Express (pronounced ess-express; sometimes spelled S'Xpress or S-Express; otherwise known as Victim of the Ghetto) were a British dance music act from the late 1980s who had one of the earliest commercial successes in the acid house genre.

"Theme from S'Express", based on Rose Royce's "Is It Love You're After", was also one of the earliest recordings to capitalize on sampling culture and it topped the UK Singles Chart as well as the Hot Dance Club Play chart in the United States (also scraping into the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at number ninety-one).   The main player in the act was DJ/producer and remixer Mark Moore. 1989 saw the release of their debut album Original Soundtrack, which featured a group line-up of Mark M (Moore, noise engineer), MichellÃƒÂ© (microdot clarinet and vox), Mark D (trumpet, noise, boogie factor), Jocasta (hi-hat hairspray, background vox) and Pascal (Pascal Gabriel, noise engineer). The album consisted of slightly longer versions of S-Express's "Theme" and its follow-up club hits "Superfly Guy" and "Hey Music Lover," along with an album's worth of new compositions. Singer Billie Ray Martin also appeared on several tracks on their debut.

By the release of the second album Intercourse, the act was reduced to a duo of Moore with new vocalist and DJ Sonique. Although not as successful as their debut, Intercourse spawned several mid-charting UK singles and club hits, most notably "Nothing to Lose", co-written with Martin Gordon, as were several other tunes on the record. Sonique, already a successful DJ, eventually embarked on a solo career and produced one of the biggest pop and club hits of the late 1990s ("It Feels So Good"). Moore went on to release many singles, remixes and albums on his own and also formed the band Needledust.

On the eve of the 20th anniversary of acid house, Mark Moore has apparently resurrected S'Express from the "cryogenic chamber" (ref:and has released a new song on the French Kitsune record label called "Stupid Little Girls." This song can be found on the recent "Boombox" compilation.

Mark Moore has also recently (2007) remixed Client, Soft Cell, and the B-52s. [ W I K I P E D I A  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S'Express ]
