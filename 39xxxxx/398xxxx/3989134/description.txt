ArtyTorrent Music Production Pack 18-Battery 1.0 VSTi+22 kits-Drum Oneshots WAV
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An old but useful VSTi drum sampler: Version  1 of Native Instruments' Battery, complete with 22 kits. The VSTi is the working cracked version from Paradox (Thanks!).
UnRAR the kits into folders within the Battery Kits directory. Then when the VSTi has been installed you can load them up by using the FILE menu on the right hand side of the GUI.
The drum oneshots are provided as 44KHz mono samples that will load up in any sampler if you don't want to use Battery.
Kits include acoustic, rock, dance, hip hop, electro, beatbox, soul and distorted.

More oneshot drums will be posted in coming days, so keep checking my torrents on thepiratebay.org for new loops and samples.
