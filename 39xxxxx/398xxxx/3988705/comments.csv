,gymclasshero42,2008-01-21T21:21Z,Is anyone else having problems with the sound? What did you do to fix them if so?
,gymclasshero42,2008-01-21T21:28Z,"never mind, the sound works"
,duderofthenight,2008-01-21T21:56Z,"yeah, i guess the sounds goes out of sync for a little bit, then fixes itself. i watched at 3 in the morning on demand, so haven't really checked this version out beyond seeing that is in indeed ep 4, just thought you all might be waiting for it ;) "

,thugcat12,2008-01-22T06:04Z,Can someone upload the rapidshare files? I am not fortunate enough to have a premium account. Many thanks to the person who does.
,Yaadman,2008-01-22T09:05Z,"Normally I would just watch a bad upload without complaints but this is unwatchable. Sorry duder...I hope you don't stop uploading though, just hope u make it better next week. Peace."

,boxcarlegend,2008-01-22T22:54Z,"how bad is it really?
the episode 3 i downloaded had pretty bad sound sync and fuzziness but for a pure junky was worth watching. is this the same or simply unwatchable?
also people need to stop putting spoilers in their comments - don't go near that ep 7 page"
,soup100,2008-01-25T04:39Z,"This torrent is much better:
