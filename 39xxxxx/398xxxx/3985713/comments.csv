,JERRY_CURLJUICE,2008-01-20T02:09Z,Seed please...
,JERRY_CURLJUICE,2008-01-20T02:17Z,Thanks! You rule!
,paulluap855,2008-01-20T02:19Z,this isint by chance HD is it?
,zedhoe,2008-01-20T02:29Z,HD in a 3 hour event and the file is 400~ mb? dont think so haha
,halfaclue,2008-01-20T02:38Z,Anyone know of a high quality rip for this?
,Teknothug,2008-01-20T02:40Z,how is this file only 485 megs and its a 3 hour pay-per-veiw? all the commentary gone?
,dudave,2008-01-20T02:54Z,single fights guys... not HD of course
,JERRY_CURLJUICE,2008-01-20T03:47Z,is it bad quality or just minus the extraneous commentary and clips? 
,Throatpoker,2008-01-20T03:51Z,Thanks for the vid!!! Don't let Dana torch yo ass! j/k :)
,eh57,2008-01-20T04:08Z,From the files inside it looks like it's missing the main event of Pen vs. Stevenson.  
,Teknothug,2008-01-20T04:19Z,"not to bag on Dudave, but i think this warrents waiting for the full release...but then again I like the commentary and pre-fight pissing contests  LOL

and it does look like it lacks the main event fight

thanks for taking the time though dudave"
,JERRY_CURLJUICE,2008-01-20T04:24Z,I see a pennvsstev.asf.  That is the main event?
,eh57,2008-01-20T04:25Z,Actually I don't fkn get it.  If your going to record one fight why not just record the whole show.  Saving bits and bytes?  Jesus fk.  
,JERRY_CURLJUICE,2008-01-20T04:28Z,"you don't have to download it, shit.  he put up what he wanted to and the size that was manageable for him, I suppose.  It's free so quit your fucking complaining - nobody is forcing you to download it."
,eh57,2008-01-20T04:29Z,"Ok, it's there...I take it back.  Still next time just take out the commericals.  "
,eh57,2008-01-20T04:33Z,Go fuck yourself Jerry.  Ya fkn assclown -it was an honest mistake.  
,JERRY_CURLJUICE,2008-01-20T04:37Z,"Ha! - no hostility, man.  I would rather have the whole thing too.  It's just kinda funny to get pissed at someone that is giving us something out of their own generosity."
,h4ns0l0,2008-01-20T05:47Z,"Thanks dudave. your effort IS appreciated by the MASSES @ tpb.

The Big Fuck You to all complaining beeatchez!"
,unchillphil,2008-01-20T07:02Z,"Thanks!

This is all the fights, none of the talking, replays, etc.  It's good and was the first one I found online.  I even registered just to say thanks!  There is now a full version available as well, which I might download, but this one is short and fast, some people might not want to wait."
,stimparello,2008-01-20T10:28Z,this is a little rough but will do if you do not want to wait.  all fights are here BUT they are short and sweet no pre match or after match.  main fight was super blurry for me.  Either way thanks for the upload!
,dugforeva,2008-01-20T10:48Z,"the Penn Stevenson fight starts 30 seconds into the round and is terrible quality.

Wait for something better."
,FatFuckFrank,2008-01-20T11:17Z,I would naked choke all you biatches
,C98,2008-01-20T13:00Z,small file ? many thx anyway
,bonbari3,2008-01-20T15:04Z,Thanks for sharing
,razz1968,2008-01-20T15:30Z,thanks for the upload    quality is good but if you have main event would you please reload it 
,Teknothug,2008-01-20T17:51Z,"might as well download this all...i have downloaded the other full length ones and they are pw protected bullshit!

good lookin dudave, please can you do the whole ppv next time"
,dudave,2008-01-20T18:05Z,"dowload this one, it's not pass protected, i'm seeding it and got it from another place.:

,jurassicrex,2008-01-20T18:44Z,Thanks for the Post dudave. Keep em coming.. I really appreciate smaller rips for ufc events. 
,topher27,2008-01-20T19:22Z,No Penn Vs. Stevenson match...WTF?
,Ozziev17,2008-01-20T20:21Z,All the fights were here...the picture quality on the Penn wasn't great quality but nonetheless THANKS DUDAVE...I got to see fights thats all that counts
,makinconnections,2008-01-20T20:29Z,"Everythings cool with this one, however no main bout. The cool man that Dudave is, he has hooked us up with a good link in the comments.
The working password for that torrent is ...

thank ramiumpton for that.  Peace."
,Godgoth,2008-01-20T20:46Z,"pennvsstev.asf is the main event.
A .asf file is a stream recorded in WMA
If for some reason you cant read it on some player simply rename the .asf to .wma"
,Godgoth,2008-01-20T20:49Z,"EDIT:
A .asf  file is a .WMA or .WMV
in this case rename it to .wmv"
