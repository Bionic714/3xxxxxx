,FulSula,2008-02-02T13:40Z,Thanks No virus in keygen. workin fine fore me
,Scorpian_2,2008-02-08T17:49Z,"AVG found none, and I've just updated it. Could be those finding viruses (since the # isn't consistent) are getting viruses elsewhere that are doing damage."
,Guevara_CF,2008-02-29T23:44Z,"I downloaded only the keygen, scanned with AVG Anti Spyware and AVG Free, didn't find anything. If you use Norton, be wary, it detects anything that could be a threat to microsoft (even if it is a keygen to a completely different, privately owned program) and will declare it a virus. Norton deleted my rainbow tables last night! I spent days generating them!
Great program, no virus in keygen, will vouch for that."
,fLaWeD_DeSiGnS,2008-03-01T18:47Z,ok......this is dumb are you ppl that stupid? most keygens/patches are detected as viruses by most a.v. software because it's from an outside source
