,HendrikT,2008-12-24T14:01Z,"You dont need to sign, just check this page

http://www.finestfones.com/2008/06/installing-unsigned-apps-for-newbies.html

or just surf a few minutes on this homepage

www.finestfones.com . You will find a solution here. After you followed this procedures you install route66, a map is/or should be made on your memorycard system/apps/route66/maps  in maps you put your map, for example benelux.prm or europe, whatever. when you start route66 on your mobile is will ask for a code, this should be a random code with 16 numbers. If it works and route66 starts, it could take a while before the gps is found. It could take a more than 2 minutes."
