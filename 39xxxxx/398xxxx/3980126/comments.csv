,Takster,2008-01-17T09:41Z,Thanks bro. Will try it out.
,eddywin,2008-03-02T19:14Z,keygen/patcher is a virus. 
,eYePrO,2008-06-16T17:12Z,eddywin? Were did you get that from? Im using this program and I got Kaspersky Antivirus v.7 and I've never had any difficulties.
,PyreBorn,2008-09-13T09:04Z,Does this patch allow for system tray support?
,DmnY92,2009-02-03T10:39Z,"Yes, Objectdock Plus enables system tray support."
,hellbringer616,2009-05-10T08:57Z,"AVG picked up a virus, before i even ran the keygen after i extracted. trying to install in explorer.exe

I don't trust it, I wouldn't download."
,klamb213,2009-06-02T16:30Z,"wow some people are retarded.... ""keygens"" are concidered malware so of
course your anti-virus is going to pick it up. Is this the first time you've ever downloaded anything with a keygen?"
,flamingfuzzy,2009-06-11T04:17Z,"No viruses, it just reads like a virus to the anti-virus programs.

It worked fine for me.

Thanks eYePrO"
,Pandemic_,2009-06-25T05:21Z,"False alarm, the same crack I use every time I install. Gets quarantined every time, bit annoying really..."
,ProjektFUbaR,2009-07-18T19:02Z,"AVG SUUUUCKS!

Most anti-virus programs read keygens as ""malware"" so it quarantines it.

@ ""hellbringer616""
You're stupid as hell. explorer.exe is your desktop/icon manager... in otherwords, it's trying to save it to your operating system.

It's not actually a virus... idiots..."
,G-rawl,2009-12-18T17:05Z,"it's not a virus, I know it. I use this on my work machine. can someone seed this torrent for me?"
,naah,2009-12-26T01:54Z,"Confirming that the keygen is not a virus. App, gen and cracked worked great on win7 x64. Im protected by Norton Internet Security 2010 which I had to disable while using the keygen. 

Thanks for the up eYePrO
