The recording of the follow-up to the critically-acclaimed but commercially mediocre Brian Wilson began almost as soon as the dust had settled from that release. This time round, the good Doctor Landy decreed that Brian would produce his own album - under his direction, of course. That Sire completely rejected the product that was turned in was hardly surprising, for with Landy's hand on the tiller, the album - tentatively titled Brian - was something of a dog's dinner, the few worthwhile compositions swamped under an inept production. Smarting from this rebuke, Landy prevailed upon Brian to revise the tapes, now retitled with outstanding sensitivity and tact, Sweet Insanity. The result, despite a campaign by Landy that included the mailing out of the dreadful "Smart Girls" rap as a promo cassette and promising journalists access to Brian in return for a positive review of the album (and astonishingly, some took the bait), was a scarcely improved product that was once more rejected. Shortly thereafter, Landy and Brian were legally separated and no more was heard of the project. the 2004 release of Brian's Gettin' In Over My Head saw the release - in newly recorded form - of the following songs: "Make A Wish", "Rainbow Eyes", "Save The Day" (with new lyrics,  retitled "Fairy Tale") and "Let's Stick Together" (new lyrics, retitled "The Waltz").
Possibility of release: according to Brian, the master tapes have been stolen
