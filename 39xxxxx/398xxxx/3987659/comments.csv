,meow_cat,2008-01-21T10:24Z,"I was half asleep when I uploaded this! At least ive managed to get a hold of this very rare *unofficial* album, which only a few copies were distributed by the NZ Kiss Army, of which my uncle was vice president of. Its not fan recorded, it was professionaly recorded backstage for the Kiss Army... but hey, if your gunna cry over the date then do it. I dont care, and im sure everybody else will apreciate im actually uploading this rare album instead of keeping it to myself."
,meow_cat,2008-01-21T10:27Z,"Just to clarify for the baby who cares more about that date than my generosity uploading this rare album, they played on 3rd December, 1980. I was there at western springs and its also the final show of the Unmasked tour, which also marks Ace Frehley's last full show as a member of Kiss until the reunion tour in 1996. So, what you going to cry about next ""friutcake"" that ive made a spelling mistake? pff, i dont care what you have to say, so keep up the insults and waste your time buddy"
,neiltracy00,2008-01-24T16:28Z,"my, you do like yo brag. Your description of all that bull, my dad this and kiss army recorded that, crap, never been known in the kiss boot lists, just a boot or a soundboard, nothing more, you reek of bull my man, like this upload."
,meow_cat,2008-01-27T08:02Z,"Fuck off neiltracy00 - it is true, search the net for info in the NZ Kiss Army you looser. Look for Kevin Todd, my uncle.... NOT my dad. Your reading and comment is the only bull here! And also, who are you to come along and state its a boot or soundboard when I havnt even seeded this yet! Ive been away and havnt had time to seed it fully yet, so not even one copy has gone out!  Hahaha, I got you there... Go and leave your ""bull"" somewhere else and stop making shit up"
