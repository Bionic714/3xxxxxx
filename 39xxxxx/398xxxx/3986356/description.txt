This file runs under Windows as well as Linux

HOWTO

1. make sure you have java installed (www.java.com)

2. for use under Windows, rename the file i2pinstall.jar to i2pinstall.exe and run it
    OR
   for use under Linux or Windows launch the jar file, either by double-clicking it or by running
   java -jar i2pinstall.jar

3. make sure, your firewall accepts UDP port 8887 from the outside to your computer

4. run the router: ./runplain.sh OR ./i2prouter start

5. after the installation point your browser to http://localhost:7657/ where you find your i2p 
   routers  control interface

6. in order to browse the I2P internal web (website URLs ending with ".i2p"), make your browser
   use the proxy http://localhost:4444/ but mention localhost as exception (bypassing the proxy) 
   in order to be able to reach the control interface.
   Hint: if you want to be able to browse the official internet the same time as the i2p web, use
         scripts/i2pProxy.pac as automatic proxy configuration URL for your browser.
