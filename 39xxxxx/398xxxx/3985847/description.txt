This is the fix to get ur mouse to work which was originally uploaded to Demonoid by Dagowatt, while it was up.

to get it to work.
       
Copy your GTA San Andreas folder from:
\"GTA San Andreas.app/Contents/Resources/transgaming/C_drive/Program Files/Rockstar Games/\"

into:
\"GTA San Andreas.app fixed.app/Contents/Resources/transgaming/C_drive/Program Files/Rockstar Games/\"

this should work because i have tried it.
