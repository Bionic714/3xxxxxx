,KittyPaw,2008-01-27T17:14Z,"Does any one know how to play it online? 
Thanks a lot"
,KittyPaw,2008-01-30T02:50Z,how play this gta sa intel multiplayer? please does anyone know??????????
,himti,2008-02-03T04:17Z,"@ KittyPaw:
u probrably have to switch the game over to a windows computer then get the mod for mutiplayer, install it then put bak on ur mac."
,KittyPaw,2008-02-05T01:04Z,"@ himti, thank you himti, I did as you said, but it I needs to launch the samp.exe which won't launch on Mac..  what should I do?"
,rspoppi,2008-02-08T13:07Z,it hasn't worked for me. despite all correct.
,himti,2008-02-27T09:38Z,"ok i found out how to fix it up a lot more:
find your config files in your GTA San Andreas Preferences folder
in config search for [sdldrv]
and add a line after forceVsync
""MouseWarping"" = ""0""

THen search for   [dinput]
add a line after defaultdeadzone
""AbsoluteMouseSensitivity"" = ""1""
then it should work better"
,himti,2008-02-27T09:39Z,"@ KittyPaw:
open samp.exe on a windows computer

btw i actualy have no idea. only trying to help."

,Jezpuh,2008-03-14T14:33Z,"it worked, but it can only turn so much degrees, i think like 400 degrees around or something, which is kind of annoying. but with the fix at least the mouse works and behaves normally, except the 400 degrees thing"

If you turn the mouse sensitivity up all the way in-game, you get a bit more freedom. But i actually discovered via a glitch of some sort, that the mouse only goes as far as the edge of the screen on the horizontal. "
,hatae55,2008-03-24T21:09Z,"I tried what himti said and in all my config files, mousewarping were already 0 and absolutemousesensitivity were already 1. the mouse is still super jumpy"
