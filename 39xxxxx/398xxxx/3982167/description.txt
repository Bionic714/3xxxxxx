 Spirit front man Randy California put together a nice mix of material for this 1972 outing.  The Beatles and Paul simon are represented and well played.   Straight forward B & W photography adorns the cover, but with the lettering it makes for an interesting look.  Very Spirit-like in nature, this is a record worth a listen or two if you can find it.
