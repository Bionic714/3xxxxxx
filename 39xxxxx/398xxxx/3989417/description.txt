Morrowind Game of the Year Xbox Perfect Edition:
(sorry for not spending hours creating ASCII Art)

READ THIS! I know it's lengty, but for Christ sake at least skim it
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This upload is the result of over a year of testing, researching, downloading,
converting files and scoring this game with a worthy
soundtrack.

I will list most of the things added as well as notes and
annotations appropriate to each one. But first...I will 
give thanks to the many modders and people that have helped this lengty and ardous
project come to fruition.

Most people thank at the end, but not me. These people are important
and deserve recognition:

I'm sorry I can't thank everyone individually, but my way of thanks is this pack!

Johnny evil - has a website of tons of xbox converted MORROWIND MODS

Frezzno and Badboy from X-box sky - I used some of their stuff
and they also gave me the idea.

Bethesda Softworks - How could I not thank them?

people are planetelderscrolls - all the various modders, whose mods I've tested
I don't have room to include all their names, but I thank them all and you should too!

Composers that have made the music I've included - too many to name

Thank me if you have the time - I've spent over a year on this, and the better part
of the last 6 hours, writing the FAQ, updating the mods, adding new music and uploading this!

And lastly, I thank all of you for keeping this going and downloading this pack


Soundtrack:
--------------
consists of;

Most of the music from Oblivion, converted by me, to wma format

several "good" orchestral video game songs

a few LOTR selections and some of the original Morrowind Music

Selections from Kingdom of Heaven and Batman Begins

Two great themes from Chronicles of Narnia - They fit so well into the game it will 
make you cry like a little girl


WARNING****  I have disabled certain mods for stability reasons, I have left them in the date folder,
enable them, however, at your own risk. Some are okay to use after the main quest is done. The Ultimate
Galleon is one of them. Some of the others should just stay disabled.

Mod Listing:

ARMOR, CLOTHING:
----------------

Netch Adamantium Armor: Check out the Inn in Peliagad

Renaissance clothing: Go to Suran

Dragonscale Armor: 	

The Tsaesci Dragonscale Armour is one of the rarest sets of armour in existence. It was forged from the scales of black dragons during their destruction in Akavir and the metal adamantium by an unknown dragon hunter.

You can find the armour and longbow in a locked chest with a lock rating of 100 in Balmora. The chest itself is being cared for by the imperial spymaster who resides in Balmora.

Ninja Outfits: Purchase in Molag Mar

Ymdrisl: The armour is currently lying on the crates on the raised platform at the silt strider port in Gnisis with the shield and a few weapons, the other sets are near the temple as are the rest of the weapons.

SPELLS:
----------------

Scripted Spells: allows you to turn into animals as well as a few
other nice spell;) HINT* buy from merchant in Vivec Mage Guild*** SEE ADDITIONAL 
README BELOW____ NOTE* I have tested this extensively and it runs very well, just don't 
do too many crazy things at once. Like spawn 100 skeletons and turn into a bat and fly around...
YEs I have done this :)

SCRIPTED SPELLS
Version    1.5
Requires   Bloodmoon
Author     Cortex
Bat Model  Lady Eternity	

Transform into creatures that can be seen in 3rd person view.
Steal spells from enemies minds.
Add explosive damage to your attacks.
Create walls of fire and animated bones.

Game balanced: Great care has been taken to ensure spells cost enough magicka for their power. Transformations disable hand held weapon use and most spellcasting. Wall spells require strategy to be effective. Stealing spells is a crime unless they attacked you first.

This mod adds new spells created through scripting and new npc's who sell them.

Mages guild         - Ald-ruhn mages guild

The clan vampire NPC's teach you after you have done the first quest of their clan.
The non clan vampire teaches vampires after you have done a small quest for her.


*****************************************************************

TRANSFORMATION SPELLS
---------------------
The metamorphosis spells lasts 60 seconds.
The form spells are permanent until you cancel them.
This means you could fly all the way to Solsheim with a single casting of bat form.
You can cancel the transformation by casting the Cancel Transformation spell
which requires no magicka.
Low cost vampire versions of the bat, mist and wolf spells exist from vampire npc's.
Werewolfs receive low cost werewolf versions of black, brown, white wolf spells when they
first cast the normal version of that spell.

wolf (dire wolf)            Deadly fast shock bite and imune to shock

Natural weapons attacks like bite use the handtohand combat skill:
It may seem to use the shortblade skill but actually it is the hand to hand
skill that is used and increased. This is how it works:
When you transform, your handtohand skill is copied into your shortblade skill.
Any increases in skill are applied to your handtohand skill.
When you transform back your shortblade skill returns to its old value.

SPELL STEALING SPELLS
---------------------
These rip spells from the minds of your enemies teaching them to you.
This causes permanent brain damage to your victim and saves you money.
Each spell has touch range.

To use these, cast the spell on the npc, wait about 1 second for them to be
affected by the spell, then press spacebar on the npc within the 5 seconds duration
of the spell.

They consider it an attack for all these spells except the passive brain scan.

Crimes:
If someone spots you useing these spells they can report the following crimes:
Assault - Using any of these spells (except passive brain scan) unless the target
          attacked you first.
Theft   - Stealing spells unless the target attacked you first.

Once their brain has become too badly damaged you will no longer be able to
access any more of their spells.

Occasionally during a combat a target may become too angry for mind rips to work
on them.
When this happens the message "This characture is in combat" will appear.
If this happens, waiting for 3 days will reset their fight setting so you can try again.

These spells were invented by the arch lich Zahnodram who was rumored to keep
wizards alive for days in his dungeons contineously stealing their spells and
then healing their minds with restoration magics.

Brain Scan (active)        - Allows you to check what spells they have.
Brain scan (passive)       - As active scan but they dont consider it an attack.
Mind rip I                 - Steal spells up to a total value of 100 gold.
Mind rip II                - Steal spells total value 200 gold
Mind rip III               - Steal spells total value 400 gold
Mind rip IV                - Steal spells total value 800 gold
Mind rip V                 - Steal spells total value 1600 gold
Mind rip VI                - Steal spells total value 3200 gold


******************************************************************

EXPLOSIVE STRIKE SPELLS
-----------------------
These last 60 seconds.
Each attack you make with a weapon or hand to hand causes an explosion.
These spells are designed to be used together.
If you cast all of them there isn't much that can withstand your attacks.
Explosive strike spells do NOT yet work while you are transformed.

Explosive Strike - Fire       Explosion of 1-20 fire damage
Explosive Strike - Frost      Explosion of 1-20 frost damage
Explosive Strike - paralysis  Explosion of 1 second paralysis
Explosive Strike - poison     Explosion of 1-20 poison damage
Explosive Strike - Shock      Explosion of 1-20 shock damage


****************************************************************

WALL SPELLS
-----------
Each type of wall comes in 5 ranks, so a rank 5 wall of fire does 100 damage per second.

Wall Range                   Allows you to set the distance walls will be created
                             from you.

Walls of fire                Damage (20 x rank)
                             Duration 60 seconds

Walls of ice                 *** WALLS OF ICE ARE NOT IN CURRENT RELEASE ***
                             Health (100 x rank) for each block of ice
                             lose one health per second.
                             Take double damage from fire.
                             Enemies will attack them to get to you.

Walls of bone                Health (20 x rank) for each skeleton
                             Damage (1 to 4) x rank
                             Duration 60 seconds
                             This means a rank 1 wall skeleton is half as powerful
                             as a normal summoned skeleton.
                             A rank 2 is equal to a normal summoned skeleton.
                             A rank 5 is two and a half times as powerful
                             as summoned skeleton.

The vampire transformations are the same as the mortal versions except they
cost half the amount of magicka and automatically succeed. This is because vampires
are better at changing into bats, mist and wolves than mortals.

As in daggerfall, Vampire charm mortal and vampire flight are low cost versions of
the standard mortal spells charm mortal and levitate.
As it is flight not levitate, the vampire version doesnt give a purple glow.

The werewolf transformations are the same as the mortal versions except they
cost half the amount of magicka and automatically succeed. This is because werewolfs
are better at changing into wolves than mortals.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
1. It is very hard to fight in 3rd person mode if transformed into a large creature
   like a guar, bear or cliffracer. I lower the model in combat to try to make it easier.
2. Many transformations are best used outside as they are too clumsy for
   easy indoors movement unless in 1st person mode.
3. Any transformation may jump in and out when in 3rd person mode if you
   have a very slow framerate. Slow framerates may be due to a low end
   machine, or may be due to another mod that attempts to do too much each frame.

CHEATS, OTHER:
--------------
Werewolf Ring: Allows you to become a werewolf at will. Hint
look on plate in Vivec Mage Guild dining room. Will transform you
for 24 hours into a werewolf.

Cheat Ring and other Cheat Items: Check closet, downstairs in Balmora 
Mage Guild - to activate press A button and then the B button - contains a house!

Arrow Belts-	This mod adds four belts to the enchanter in Ald-ruhn, Manor district. 
When you equip the belts they summon arrows and equip them whenever you run out. 
There are three types of belts; Belt of Arrows (normal arrows), Belt of Burning Arrows 
(fire damage and weakness to fire), Belt of Stunning Arrows (paralize), and Belt of Poison Arrows (poison). 
I tried my best to not make this a cheat mod. The arrows are not worth anything, so you cannot make money from 
summoning hordes of arrows. The belts are worth a good amount of money, too. These arrows are not EXTREMELY powerful, 
but will give you a little more power in battle.

BOOKS:
------

Shakti's Book of Secrets: Buy in Balmora Bookstore, a great comprehensive
game guide

INFORMATION AND WARNINGS SECTION:

-------------------------------------
READ THIS, IMPORTANT!

QUEST PROBLEMS: 

If you can't get out of the Census Office, or if you can, 
but can't get your quest from Old man Caius Cosades in Balmora, relax...
This is a common error, disable, not delete, disable a few mods and try again.
Yes it can be time consuming, but I've done it for hours and days. 
This pack is pretested to not get quest errors, but if it does, just troubleshoot.

MINOR GLITCHES:

Yeah there might be a few, but if they don't mess up the game don't worry, or disable the mod.


DIRTY DISC ERROR!
-----------------
If for some reason you get a dirty disc error at some point...

PREVENTION:

1. try to keep save file size low
2. have backup saves, but delete them periodically
3. dispose of corpses, try to keep inventory within reason
i.e; filling your house with tons of schools hit is fun, 
remember the xbox has 64 mb of measly RAM.

1. relax, this is normal
2. think about disabling intense mods, if you wish

Here's a better FAQ about this problem from 

DIRTY DISC
-------------------------

It's not really dirty, okay.  Get over it. 
It's a known bug that plagues Morrowind on XBox.
There is no way to stop it, but it can be reduced.
This tip also includes reducing the incidence of 'freeze' that will 
happen as your game gets longer and longer.

Firstly, go to your Options menu on the Start Screen and turn 
OFF autosave and shadows. 
That's the dirty disc problem half-solved.
Not to mention the fact that you won't have to wait forever for 
an autosave to finish every time you sleep.
But . . . save, save, save!  It's now up to you to keep your own
back-ups with the autosave turned off!

Secondly, don't try and do too much at once when 
your game gets lengthy.  By this I mean;
1] Don't levitate at high speed while wearing the Boots of Blinding Speed, 
battling a cliff racer and checking directions from your 
inventory map at the same time!
I'd freeze too, if someone did that to me!

2] Don't drop stuff all over the place.  The hard-drive is forced to 
remember where it is forever; if you don't want it, drop it in a crate 
or sell it to a trader.

3] Don't move people around un-necessarily.  Sure, it can be fun 
to 'command' people onto rooftops or such, but again, the game has 
to remember what you've done.

4] Bury your dead!  Not literally, use the 'dispose of corpse' option 
as much as you can.  Yes, I know the game cleans up after you, but in the 
three game days it takes for that to happen, a lot of folk can wind up 
dead, their goods and their bodies cluttering up your save 
like seagulls at a picnic basket.

Be tidy with the dearly departed.

At least once every game day, save your game as a 'new save'.
This helps reset characters that have moved and tidy up your leftovers.
Exit via Start Screen and start again, deleting old game before you load.
