you really ROCK.
I bought my xbox kinda late and when i was trying to get into the  game, but isaw many who retreated.

i felt kinda sad and i also left the game, thinking no one even cares modding it now, but to come and think of a guy, who cared for the game , taking a YEAR'S time to perfect it. i mean thats really good thing . i can't tell you how pleased i am with you, i read through what all you put but just some things before you go -

1.) you have put a good lot of mods, will this pose a prblem to speed and dirty disks a lot(i mean you already wrote about it but still)

2.) are u sure the textures mods,faces, and bodies r der. cause when i tried it would give me dirty disks when i overloaded with other mods.

3.) i am really pleased with your transformation spell.

4.)man you deserve to be treated more than this, 
    why don't you work with bethesda or ea or something.
they need guys like you to put there heart and soul into the game

5.)please donot abandon this game, you have encouraged me to play it again,

6.) i recommend everyone to play this game ,PLEASE

MORROWIND HERE I COME"

,fieryfire,2008-01-28T05:24Z,"A REALLY AWESOME MOD, EVEN BY THE DETAILS GIVEN HERE. THIS IS NOT A HYPE, A REALLY GR8 MOD, WIDELY RANGED, TONS OF SPELLS , PLACES TO STAY, PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT , NICE SOUNDTRACKS .

ONE THING THOU, I AM ONLY DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE ARE NO TEXTURE MODS.

HEY WOULD IT HURT THE GAME PERFORMANCE IF I ADD VIBRANT MORROWIND MOD OR FANTASY VISUAL MOD PACK.  WHAT DO U SAY TANGLED"

,kingofthenet,2008-02-11T23:59Z,"Well this sure does look great with the better NPC bodies and the birds, too bad it completely broke all the quests. I installed it without modification and I cannot even give the ring to Fargoth or report the tax collector murder or give the package to Caius, Any ideas?"
,fieryfire,2008-02-16T20:23Z,"tats rite... i've experienced it tooo... i cant give the package to caius the game is gone...

,fieryfire,2008-04-07T06:33Z,"wait up wilson,

don't credit me for making this mod, I DID NOT MAKE THIS MOD.i really like the game but i could not get this game to work furthur after the first mission.the real guy who made this mod is in another site with xbox mods included go find it out in there buddy."
,Wilson..,2008-04-07T17:49Z,o reet lol didnt no i jus went an bought the original the other day so im not bothered anymore coz i was sick of doin the same thing over an over again
,Wilson..,2008-04-24T12:35Z,were the fck is the ninja outfit
,twistedspear,2008-05-08T04:59Z,"very good game. retextures are very nice, though now that the storyline is fucked idk what to do. i get the ""dirty disk"" error alot but who doesnt? anyway its a very good download. worked perfectly for me. Thanks for the seed!"
,moonwarden,2008-05-20T06:25Z,"I am fairly new at this... so forgive my question...
how do I copy/install it/run it on the x box?"
,goat89,2008-07-07T20:04Z,"Wth, When talking about mind spells you tell us to us spacebar after a second...and later on, it says ""Xbox's only have 64M of RAM"" or something. Which is it gonna be, Pc, Or Xbox?"
,jdb1980,2008-07-27T19:11Z,"I agree with the above comments, the Main Quest is fucked here, and I have no idea how I'm supposed to ""Disable"" any mods that might be interfering with it... I can confirm that this is an XBOX version, though, it should have been pretty obvious... You have to have a modified xbox to use it, just save it to the HD, and start it up through whatever dash you installed, if you don't understand that you need to go to xboxscene.com and learn... Anyone know how to get Caius Cosades to give me my quest?"
,andychanz,2008-07-31T18:21Z,"is this the full game with mods added.
do i only have to create an iso, burn it to dvd (as usual) r do i need morrowind game aswell (i got goty already on dvd)
thx for any replies."
,andychanz,2008-08-05T16:19Z,nevermind i see there is a default.xbe  so it is a game iso
,Gortie,2008-08-07T17:43Z,Great job UberChar! Much appreciated. =)
,pelle busemann,2008-12-09T15:23Z,"I transfered the game to my HDD. Started the game, created a character. I put my character in town (i didnt pause no). Then my phone rang, and when I came back after 40 mins. The game had a ""bad disk error on the screen"".  So something is not perfect about this version..."
,weepndvl,2009-09-17T21:39Z,"Some mods need to be left disabled.  If the game glitches, just disable some of the mods.  What the fuck does that mean - that you obviously don't have a clue?  ""I tested this game for over a year"".  Doesn't sound like you have made the ""perfect"" game at all.  Doesn't sound like you know shit, Jack.  You found a bunch of cool mods that conflict with each other and you call that perfect?  Hah!"
,kotj101,2010-01-06T13:58Z,"here's the deal! This is the xbox original game with a bunch of mods added! It will NOT work with the mods (whoever put all this together didn't know what they were doing!) on a xbox.
[dirty disc error without even having the disc in!!]

To get it to work, copy the contents of the dvd to the xbox, or just copy the folder directly to the harddrive ( the xbox hd). Rename 'morrowind.xbe' to something else 'morrowind.xbe123'..

Then find 'morrowind.BAK' and rename that to 'morrowind.xbe'

Simple as that! Hopefully this will save somebody the hours of frustration I endured tying to get to the save point with all the modded, glitched out garbage!

Thanks anyways to the uploader!

ps. for future reference, put some directions in the readme on how to disable the crap.. when you know its not stable!"
,dyrtyrice,2010-12-20T00:38Z,"Hey all, just wanted to confirm that this is the original torrent and FAQ I had uploaded to xbox sky. Thanks for reuploading this UberChar and enjoy!"
,dyrtyrice,2010-12-20T00:39Z,"If you want to disable any of the mods; just rename the .esp or .esm files to any other extension in the data files folder
