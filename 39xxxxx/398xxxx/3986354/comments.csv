,SeptimusDecimus,2008-06-21T19:38Z,"Yeah ""spread them to the public..."" Because it's not like you can go on any site like amazon and buy them or go to a CoS and buy them, or go to a Library and borrow them, or go to a CoS and ask to study them... I can't belive I signed up just to call you.. (jesus666) a fucking retard.... lol... ""spread them to the public..."" lol fucking goon. "
,kilomonk,2009-01-22T21:51Z,"What Septimus doesn't realize is that you can't buy most of them, and you can't find this in the library or even read it in the Scientology Organization unless you pay $$$ (tens of thousands of US dollars) and work your way up and consent to security checks complete with lie detector test (e-meter). and the Church of $cientology will even deny stuff that is written in these materials by them. 

forget Xenu - people can believe what they want, worship who they will. forget their beliefs and you will win far more help in this battle.

the organization is what is corrupt and a violator of people's civil and human rights. the followers are just blinded. don't attack them. educate them. forget Xenu."
,Jesus666-1,2009-01-30T06:53Z,"SeptimusDecimus  is calling me a retard? hahah, by downloading this your not supporting Scientology this way they're not making money out of you. Yes you could go to a public library to 'study' these books but most of these books are not available in the library because you'd have to pay Scientology big bucks to even read them."
