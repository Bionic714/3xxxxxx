can't you upload a screener so i can watch it with good quality on my comp??

this quality is not so great... its pixelated and colorless, almost grayscale. (and the movie itself is already gray and colorless! =P)"

I want good quality on my comp??
Go film it yourself!
this quality is not so great... its pixelated and colorless!!
The description Said ""Screener Quality on IPOD Acceptable to Good""

Which it is for the Pod, not a pc full screen. 

Don't bother to reply; their's a good boy!"

Quit ""BAWWWWW""ing and go look for the full screener yourselves."
,sapphyreskyye,2008-01-26T06:15Z,"Heh... and come to find out, when I downloaded, that this is not what the upper says it is.

This is not the DVD screener at all. It's the cam version. I have the screener, and I have the cam version -- I can tell the difference.

That, and our oh-so-smart upper didn't bother to rename the file. prevail.swnytda_Join_to_AVI.mp4 is the file name. Same file name (minus the mp4 part of course) as the cam.

Don't bother with this download. It's not worth it. Maybe I'll submit my own ipod file -- of the REAL screener."
