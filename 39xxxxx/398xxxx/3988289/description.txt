From http://bahlastiompehda.vze.com :

Don't fall asleep listening to your ordinary predictable "dark ambient" done by just pressing a few buttons or with random generators. Nothing but Dispersion will keep you on the edge with multi layered deep sounds and drones, huge dynamics, delirious noises, varying songs and strong production.

Nothing but Dispersion is a very different sounding record than than Projekt Discordia. Gone is the static distortion, Victor Motases painful screams and all laughs. No more cacophonous rhythms, melodies and unstructured songs. The only thing reminding of the past is the chaotic constantly evolving sonic waves.

Nothing but Dispersion was recorded with a synth in a few days. After that the tracks were mangled and twisted for over an year. Every possible effort has been made to generate the most unnerving and effectual sounds and disturbing soundscapes. The concept of the album is built around Aleister Crowley's Vision and Voice project. Release date 10.12.2004. Limited to 30 copies.
