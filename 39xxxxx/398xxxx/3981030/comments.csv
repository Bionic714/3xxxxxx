,Behzad93,2008-01-31T16:51Z,"I just got the CD and it's awesome. But after I've ripped it and put it on my mp3, the quality sounds a bit poor. Does this torrent actually have better quality than the CD I've bought?"
,emgee,2008-02-02T01:35Z,"Behzad93: Yeah perhaps, or you're doing crappy settings, or you're playing the CD in a high end stereo and the MP3s in crappy computer speakers, or the audio card in your computer is crap.. The possibilities are endless! :)

320kbps is supposedly great quality, although FLAC or m4a or ape or any other lossless codec should always be better than any lossy... Except for when the band really sucks and the MP3 cut-offs hide the crap! Then lossy is great!"

The possibilities are endless
