This is my iTunes 7.6 dark skin update.

It was originally made to complete my OSX appearence theme,I hope you'll enjoy it.

If you like it, please seed! ;-)

Here is a snap shot of my iTunes:

PS: sorry if my black Tunes looks a bit like WMP11... my first version was made in earlier 2006.
Windows is always late of the Mac world! ;-)

There's at least 300 users who have downloaded my previous iTunes 7.5...
Many thanks to you for enjoy it!

Finally, for all those which liked my iTunes and for all those which found it ugly, here is my tutorial to make your own iTunes skin:
