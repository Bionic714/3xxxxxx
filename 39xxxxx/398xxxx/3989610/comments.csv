,sacateca,2009-06-02T17:47Z,"sistromo: just like it's been debunked that 911 was an inside job, or that Kennedy wasn't shot by LHO?  Or anything the likes of Alex Jones say?   

i guess it's also been debunked that NASA is a BLACK HOLE as far as money is concerned.  And that NASA has nothing to do with politics, it's a nice friendly science-agency with truth as it's only interest?

Yep, totally debunked.  Absolutely 100%."
