,silencebeckons,2008-01-20T20:37Z,"Yes, For_what_its_worth, that's it.  I should have named the torrent ""Family Guy Presents Blue Harvest (R1 retail untouched)"", but what's done is done."
,The_man001,2008-06-29T00:32Z,"Is it possible that anyone will seed this? This download is really slow. I've been downloading this for about a week now!

I really want this and i'll keep seeding for quite a while so I hope you guys will aswell."
