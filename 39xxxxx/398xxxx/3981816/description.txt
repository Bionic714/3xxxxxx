This is the working ver. of VSO's ConverTXToDVD 3 RC1. The enclosed Keygen is tested and working 100% WITHOUT any "search for update" problems. The software does not store or transmit name or other information to VSO unless you set it up to. (And name is not part of the reg. process anyway)

I see no reason to have someones else's name burned into the software unless that's your thing. Please Enjoy...

P.S. Please seed this well, as I have Comcast as a service provider and they use Sandvine p2p monitoring, limiting my seeding speed.
