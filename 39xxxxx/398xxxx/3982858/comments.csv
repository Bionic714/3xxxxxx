Hi. I also struggled with this one. I found tho if u use a program called burnatonce (google it) you can burn the images successfully. Also if the .toc and .dat files are in the same location it will update the .toc file automatically. Simply click n burn.

Awesome game BTW been searching for ages for replacement human disk. Thanks so much :)"
,Draekar,2008-03-28T22:14Z,Tnx for the upload i've been searching for this for a long time :D but i can't get the martian CD to work only the human one :S does anyone know how to fix this?
,Homsar22,2008-07-10T18:22Z,Seed please! This one is very hard to find.
,Kalisam,2008-09-15T00:22Z,"Thanks a bunch.
Have been looking for this for a while since my martian CD got all scratched up.
This is the first time I have seen it on any file sharing site or anything.

Thanks again, haha"
,orangesims,2008-10-08T20:09Z,"downloaded well (and seeding!) installed fine with Burnatonce (search google for it). however, when running the game i can only get as far as the end of a cut-scene, then ""DDERR_UNSUPPORTED"" i assume this means it's not too fond of WinXP?"
,SanchorP,2008-10-20T01:09Z,"try playing it in windows 98 compability mode. im downloading now, i cant wait to play it again... after several years.

,kendelarosa5357,2009-03-27T08:25Z,This is the RTS (real time strategy) version ;c... Does any one know where can i find the FPS (first person shooter) version?
,kendelarosa5357,2009-03-27T09:00Z,"Ok, Did some research found out two things...

This is the game developed by ""Rage Software Limited"" (the real time strategy version) released in late 1998...

The third person shooter version is developed by ""Pixelogic"" nearly at the same year (1999)...
(see http://www.pixelogic.nildram.co.uk/pages/wotw.htm)

Hope i made my interpretation clear?  But if you want to correct me, that would be great, that's more knowledge to be given to Wikipedia...


So hope this would help..."

how do i get these to play?? ive tried everything i can think of and they dont work. plz some one help i wanna play this so bad!!!"
,ylfrick,2010-10-21T15:15Z,"I don't understand, what do you mean by ""modify *.toc files to correspond with your file address""? How do I do it?"
,stationmiek,2010-10-27T19:37Z,"This game works fine on Windows 7 without any alteration. To install the game, just mount the DAT file using daemon tools - when browsing for the file in DT, change the extension from the default to *.* so it can see it.

The game played straight away, but without in-game music, which can be fixed by downloading the patch."
,Sutenvulf,2011-01-01T11:17Z,Does this work ok with Win 7 64bit?
