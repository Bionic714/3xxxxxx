This is the newest from Nightwish.  To me, its their best CD to date.  Every song is awesome.  The second disc is an exact image of the first, but there is no vocals, just complete instrumental.  I ripped it from an actual CD, so quality is of the best.  Please seed for as long humanly possible, and all comments are appreciated.  Thank You.  SupermanGTR
