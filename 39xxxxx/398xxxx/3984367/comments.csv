,eMKay414,2010-04-03T22:27Z,"Without trying to be rude or sarcastic, the french idiots put this torrent in the WRONG section!!!!

This torrent is Nintendo DS Games. The irony, or coincidentally, is that the uploader included 360 games in this torrent! Go figure.

This is NOT - I REPEAT - NOT Xbox 360 games or Xbox 360 arcade games!!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD if you looking for Xbox stuff!!!

Damn!!! If only the idiotic french fries would have put a ""small"" english title, or at  'least' allocated the torrent to the correct category...."
,piratebooty71,2012-02-15T10:38Z,stupide retire ton upload et classe le pc en non xbox360.......
