If it was me, I wouldnt use anything that has to do with Microsoft, the only reason I use Office is coz Powerpoint, the equivalent in iworks is terrible"

You are a fucktard. MS Office is updated *way too often* as is when nothing of significance is being added to the program anymore. The only reason new versions of MS Word are even coming out any more is because hundreds of people at Microsoft have built their careers around releasing new versions.  "

,BRequena,2010-05-31T05:57Z,"This Software is good! Downloaded it scanned it...registered as clean...installed on MAC and runs perfectly. Didn't update, I really didn't see a need to update, plus I read everyone that had updated has problems, Microsoft probably changes the registry during the update. But If you need Office on your MAC this will work!"
