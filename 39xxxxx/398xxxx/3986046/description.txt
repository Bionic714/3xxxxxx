This fabulous album features the talent and genius of SHELLEY BERMAN, who created, wrote and directed this outstanding recording, along with the brilliant acting of JERRY STILLER and ANNE MEARA and also features LOVELADY POWELL. The album was recorded in 1960 and the humor is just as funny today as it was 46 years ago.
