,Blackhawk1969,2008-01-24T07:53Z,no problem.. when i started collecting these books I felt the same way..needed some type of reference point. if your missing anything keep checking my torrents and leave a message on my latest ones if you need something on the list you dont have. this is my latest torrent..the list..theres about 10 or so seeds still.
,Blackhawk1969,2008-01-24T07:56Z,and thanks for the offer..i have so much stuff right now i cant think of anything i need. Im trying to make room :)
