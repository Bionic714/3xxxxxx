Product Description

Since its 1990 debut, ABC's long-running reality-television series, AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS, has served up hilarious homemade video clips of bloopers, pranks, and mishaps made by the eccentric characters that populate the American landscape. This collection presents three special Christmas episodes--two with original host and sitcom star Bob Saget (FULL HOUSE) dating back to 1996 and 1997, and one 2003 episode with his successor, comedian Tom Bergeron--showcasing especially zany holiday-themed antics involving decorations, gifts, school pageants, and more.
