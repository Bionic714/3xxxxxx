,MasterBate,2008-03-23T13:44Z,"Geez, thanks Matt-Lane. The best emulator AND many of the best games for it ^^

If you're looking for more ROM's, I can recomend http://www.romscentral.com

You'll have to watch 5 pop-ups the first time you visit (as with every ROM-site these days) but after that, it's the fastest and largest site for ROM's."
,Matt-Lane,2008-03-23T18:38Z,No problem MasterBate(lol) thanks for commenting and glad you like the torrent
,kcwebmonkey,2008-03-26T23:11Z,"Re: romscentral.com:

if you go directly to the ROM page (www.romscentral.com/gbasha007.htm) then you can bypass all the popup windows."
,JoshM22,2008-03-31T21:30Z,Are these games playable with a game cube controller? I don't own a N64 anymore nor am i familiar with the Cube controller.
,Matt-Lane,2008-04-01T01:13Z,yes you can and its very easy to set up
,axeonfluke,2008-04-03T03:40Z,"I am downloading now.  While I didn't need PJ64 and didn't want a lot of the games you provided (no Turok...wtf) it was nice to find a torrent allowing me to download multiple roms at once...and for that, I say Thanks Matt-Lane!

tl;dr: needs more turok"
,Matt-Lane,2008-04-04T04:31Z,"lol sorry these are just the games i downloaded lol i never got round to turok, glad you liked the torrent though :)"

,Johnny_Koala,2008-04-14T20:33Z,"This torrent pritty much made my life...or wasted it?

Can anyone help me with this emulator though? Everything works great but I'm having issues with layering or something. Example: When I play mario tennis there are giant black squares and the ball vanishes in surtain places. anyone help me out here?"
,Matt-Lane,2008-04-14T21:15Z,"Yeah sum games are like that its just becuase the n64 hardware is totally different than pc's 

glad you enjoyed the torrent though"
