,bcooney,2008-01-26T03:05Z,"I've never used logic before so i may be missing something.... When i try to open the application it tells me that i need ""pro application support 4"" .  i tried downloading he update from apple but the program refused to be installed on my system- not sure why....  i read in another forum that pro app support 4 is only for final cut pro (that's also what the apple web site says).  any ideas? anyone?"
,bcooney,2008-01-26T06:09Z,aha! i figured it out.  i just had to go to software update in the apple menu!
,Nuggler,2008-01-27T02:01Z,yeah. it's all there. i firewired just these .apps from my friends iMac so i think you have everything

,Helsabot,2008-02-14T02:44Z,"Could you (or someone who has already downloaded this) possibly upload just Waveburner?  I already have Logic Pro 8, which I imagine makes up the bulk of the 371mb.  I'd rather not have to download any more than is necessary on my shitty university connection (average download speed is about 1kb/s with lots of seeds), so any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"
,kayowell,2008-02-16T01:26Z,"has anyone come up with a workaround for the ""previous serial"" thing? i've tried ridding my computer of every trace of previous versions, but it still demands it. it makes me suspect these are ""upgrade"" versions. where can i get a serial to satisfy it?"

,iwillmaceyou,2008-08-17T01:21Z,"Works like a charm on my MacBook 2.0 Ghz. Amazing. Thank you thank you thank you!  Fair warning, however, is that it comes with very few presets, and it's missing documentation on the plugins. That said, it's wonderful because it works! Thanks again!"
