Radiodervish was founded in Bari in 1997, an artistic partnership between Nabil Salameh and Michele Lobaccaro, who had been in the previous group, Al Darawish.
The diversity of their cultural origins gives life to songs that are like brief workshops for identifying connections between east and west. These pathways can be found in the symbols and legends of the various cultures around the Mediterranean, a frontier zone which unites and at the same time separates the peoples of the area.
The result is a refined musical portrait, a harmonious blend of melody and lyrics in Italian, Arabic, English and French, inspired by both the Arab and Western musical traditions.
This diversity is at the heart of both the originality and the innovation that sets them apart on the world music stage and on the Italian music scene.
