,antiPIG,2008-02-08T23:12Z,Sweet!!!
,Sevir,2008-02-10T07:23Z,"I know that many of you, like me, are dead tired of torrents that are broken or mis-labeled. It is my goal to provide a comment on all the torrents I download that includes any information that the original uploader omitted and also rates the torrent on overall quality using a simple five-point scale as well as any applicable virus, ad and spy-ware warnings."
[T],MrLore,2008-02-24T13:52Z,"This shouldn't be called a discography, it leaves out the 22 singles released, the Demo album and the 4 unreleased tracks."
[T],Aufseher,2008-03-01T04:12Z,"I am BESTinTEXAS (got a new name universally on mininova, TPB, and isohunt so I could release simultaneously under the same alias, donno im a freak like that) but meh. 4 unreleased songs, does that make them official then? Probably not. Then part of a discography, demo albums I just don't consider important, I don't (you can have your own philosophy) and 22 single albums? Umm, I am willing to bet all those singles were released in full albums. If not, oh well. If you believe this torrent is incomplete, by all means reorganize it and release your own, I do not find. The stronger torrent will survive and prosper, I do not care if it's mine, just want to spread the love. :) And Sevir... Where is the rating? My songs do not have viruses in them or anything and I do not believe it's broken (like the other comment, I could missing stuff but I did list what I put in the torrent, tyvm)"
,skunkworks2000,2008-03-08T22:53Z,I'm going to bet that this is as reliable as his other uploads and feel those like Sevir and Mrlore should maybe show appreciation instead of guttersniping BESTinTEXAS. You will get an organised discography thanks to the care taken for your benefit by someone who will never know or meet you! Thanks for your time BESTinTEXAS / Aufseher. My media centre for one carries and seeds alot of your work. Appreciated buddy!
,pantera6993,2008-03-09T21:55Z,"Hey, beggars can't be choosers. Apparently no one here wants to go out and buy the albums, so don't bitch about something that you are getting for free.

If you want the demos and singles or whatever go out and buy it. Don't dog someone else. Just be glad BESTinTEXAS even put this up for you."
,kejml,2008-03-24T16:53Z,"thnx, man !"

,Jack_Raiden,2008-12-03T22:47Z,"""Not all of the old MP3s were 320kbps, some where, so to keep the quality of them, I just did
CBR 320 so all of them say they're 320 when they aren't.""

This doesn't make any sense. Why would you do that? (""To keep the quality of them""??)"
,tremblay2112,2008-12-10T04:16Z,"Thx to BESTinTEXAS, Great Torrent   I really LOVE Du Hast... reminds lots of trash memories :P"

,gopotato,2009-02-09T13:49Z,"much appreciated,  and thanks for the seeds,  seeing upwards of about 1.6mbs,   will seed forever as long as its on my external. "
[T],Aufseher,2009-02-10T01:40Z,"@Jack_Raiden, I didn't really know about transcodes when I first started reorganizing the music collections that I did. I was really doing all these to reorganize them for myself, I didn't know all the specifics.

When I first started doing this, I thought ""Well if its 192kbps and I up it to 320kbps, it won't do anything but 'lie' so I can say the whole discography is 320kbps"", but now I know that results in LOSS of quality.

I would take it down but with the amount of people on this torrent, I won't. I think this is one of the few works of mine that has transcode though, maybe the only one."
,joramge,2009-03-25T16:45Z,"This is one of the best torrents! Not that fast, but everything is organised, Thanks!"

,tri33,2009-12-11T10:34Z,"I was debating between this torrent and the FLAC discography. I decided to upload this one and happy to report that it sounds great. I'm jamming out to the Live in Berlin album now-Thanks BESTinTEXAS! 

I would recommend this torrent to others. It is very well organized, has pics, etc.. and for the total size of 1.09GiB it sounds great."

Not much for what I'm expecting at almost 600 seeders and 300 leechers.
Anyway, I'll just wait. Thanks for the upload."
,Sategat,2010-05-14T03:49Z,lol max only 400 Kbps. lets seed

,raider12,2010-05-30T02:42Z,"thx, neatly organized :-)"
,kithylin,2010-06-24T16:50Z,"Okay i don't know if this ""BESTinTEXAS"" is some RIAA offical or what, but the reason some of you guys are having your mp3 players crashing is... well downloadit and try and add to winamp, only half of the songs come up with an actual duration, even winamp can't figure out how long the songs are because they're so broken, distorted, and in general mangled.

And the ones that do play, there's audible ""skipping"" at some points, and one song just plays the same 30 seconds with a ""skipping"" sound then repeats that 30 seconds again.

On top of that i had to download about 2.4gb of data just to get this 1.09gb of files because of all the stupid hashfails and having to re-download peices through out the whole thing, and now wish i hadn't wasted my time.. just gonna delete the whole directory."
[T],PeteSapai,2010-07-30T16:51Z,I see you commented on the re-encoding already. Glad to read you know you've made a mistake ;)
,2bpirating,2010-08-12T00:11Z,"Thank you ! Thanks to this torrent Im a Rammstein fan !

,Daky101,2011-07-06T22:25Z,thx
,Xemeriba,2011-07-17T20:22Z,"Dear idiots who spam ""SEED!"",

 I have never had a problem with seeders, even on torrents with very few. At the moment I am downloading this one at 1.3mb/s off 17 seeders. The reason why you people can't link to seeders is either because a) you're a tool, or b) your internet connection sucks and you are most likely running a closed NAT setting.

Thank you!"
