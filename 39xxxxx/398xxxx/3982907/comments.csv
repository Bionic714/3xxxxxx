,morgoth1,2008-01-19T02:29Z,I think this is where George Lucas got some of his ideas for his star war sagas. When this came out on USA tv channels after airing in Japan I could see how Mr. Lucas got his inspiration. As far as I am concern this series and the Comet Empire Series were what sci-fi was all about. To catman 77 thank you for bringing back this exceptional TV show.

I'm sorry to say but I only have Season 1 of the US version.
Season 2 of the Japanese version will be uploaded as soon as all the episodes of the US version is available. "

Thanks again for this great offering!"

I laughed all night watching these episodes.

Also, I had forgotten how much I loved to hear the theme music.

This one one series that needs a remake... Gundam what?"
