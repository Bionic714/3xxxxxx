I cant believe this. Well Jesus must have started off this way, convincing people of wack ideas. Maybe in 2000 years this dude will be considered the son of god."

,gecko52,2009-02-18T02:52Z,alls im saying is that the hype on this guy is way out of wack. maybe jesus was a bad example. but the fact is this guy is being idolized for making up a bunch of bull honkey.
