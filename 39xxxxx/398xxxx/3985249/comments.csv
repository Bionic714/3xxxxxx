Well ofc i want swedish artist well but I AM sceptical to buy it on itunes, because why the hell would i support apple? the got huges amount of money! they dont need it. so if U want to support him without any middleman, u should go out in the stores and buy it!"
,SonOfGates,2009-04-16T05:16Z,"jeesper_6 is right. Purchases made on Itunes go to Apple, not artists. Of a 99 cent song download only 10 cents actually makes it back to the artist while 34 cents goes to Apple and 55 to the record label.
Here is where I read that (and they give a real source) http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/09/22/113415.php
I estimate Apple could pay their costs in hosting the download easily with under 9 cents.
CDBaby.com for instance returns 91% of the money you spend directly to the artist.
Stop supporting Apple/Itunes. Support real artists, not scam artists."
