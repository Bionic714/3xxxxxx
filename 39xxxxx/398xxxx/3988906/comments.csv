,Le Capitaine,2008-01-23T11:45Z,"A mix of m4a and mp3? Come on, you could at least convert the m4a so all tracks where in mp3 format, before uploading.
The files have weird track numbers. Ex. 3 number ones, 2 number 3's plus 4,5,7 (no number 6 ?). And a track without any track number id."
,HPDarkness,2008-01-24T21:56Z,"This is crap. It's missing ROAR!, Ratata - Seventeen Years, and a couple more. All this torrent is, is someone's failed attempt to compile all the songs."
,NUSTY,2008-02-09T00:56Z,HPDarkness it's not so important if all songs are in it. Atleast he tryed. Why be so pessimistic? Good work btw.
,FluFF_ThorrenT,2008-08-26T23:18Z,"IÂ´m totally on NUSTY's side. I searched for this at 23:11 2008-08-26, and she/heÂ´s the only one who had made an attempt at finding all of the, findable, tracks. Next time HPDarkness, step out of the pissed area (i.e. your attitude) and look at what you have: 
- A good pirate,
- Someone else's hard work for you to grab,
- And now with this bonus:

Great job, eldiab21. The best attempt so far (in a good way)."
