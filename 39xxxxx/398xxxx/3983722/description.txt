Bringing a new sound to country music, Cowboy Troy's sophomore CD is another rowdy album that makes you want to get up and fix something around the house or just sit down and hang out with friends around a fire. Cowboy Troy has proven on this album that "HickHop" can be a sound that is surviving the test of time. Bringing in reinforcements like Nashville Star winner Angela Hacker, fellow Muzik Mafia member James Otto, and J. Money and co-writing songs with one half of Big & Rich's John Rich, Cowboy Troy has delivered another solid album that will surely turn heads.
Muzik Mafia member and country music's first rapper, Cowboy Troy combines his "Hick Hop" with a rock edge to his new album, Black In The Saddle. Cowboy Troy wrote or co-wrote all eleven songs on this album. He invited fellow Muzic Mafia member John Rich and well known songwriter, Bobby Pinson to also write these tunes.
