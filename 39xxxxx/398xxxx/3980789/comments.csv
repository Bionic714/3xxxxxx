,adisor19,2008-01-17T04:55Z,"How the f*ck does this include EXCHANGE support when it's the Home and Student version?!?!?!?

ADi"
,hipauliee,2008-01-17T05:16Z,"yeah all you people are wasting your time
just use the beta version.
i have leopard and it hasnt crashed once.
just patch it and set back you system time 
before that. its alot easier then 7900 leeches
and 1 seeder. that is so redick for a student version.

i am using transmission and azurez.
both say 7900 leechers
and no downloads complete.

NO PROGRESS GOD DAMN"
,hipauliee,2008-01-17T05:31Z,OMG AND JUST STOP DOWNLOADING AND SET YOUR SEEDING TO FOREVER. once people start getting full downloads THEN leech. fuck. learn how to use torrents.
,DarkElf109,2008-01-17T06:59Z,"There are a half dozen people between 95 and 100% complete, so, assuming a few of them start seeding, it'll speed up pretty soon. Now's the time to get on ;)

Plus, still under 100 leechers. No idea where you got 7900."
,DarkElf109,2008-01-17T07:00Z,"Oh, and as for Exchange support, I have no idea, I just copied that straight from Amazon. URL's provided for you to see yourself."
