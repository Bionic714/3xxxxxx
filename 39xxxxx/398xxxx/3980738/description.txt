Here's the music from Super Mario Galaxy, ripped directly from the disc. Some processing was done (with the ast_multi tool) to split out the multiple songs in some tracks (those with multi in the name) but otherwise they are unmodified.
The .ast files can be played with the Winamp plugin in_cube.

Apologies to anyone who was on the earlier torrent, this one should be identical.
