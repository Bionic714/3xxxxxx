,arc88,2008-01-22T05:45Z,Amazing! How did you rip it from the disc? This is some amazing handiwork you've done here. Think you can make a tutorial? ;)
,arc88,2008-01-22T23:47Z,"Another thing, How can we convert these .ast files into something like WAV or MP3? "

Yeah and that step would be to rewrite and reoptimize the entire code for a completely different hardware architecture, something that's not only very hard to do well, but is virtually without access to the source code."
,fnyzzel,2008-01-29T19:06Z,"that should've been ""virtually impossible"""
,TheSilverDragon,2008-02-04T05:08Z,"VERY nice. Can't believe you managed to rip all this straight out of the game. The sound is flawless. However, since Winamp apparently doesn't have mixing capabilities, do you think you could make another torrent with the un-split ASTs of the songs that have multiple tracks? I'd like to listen to some of them with the extra instrumental accoutrement, such as the Bowser fight music with the screaming Japanese loons.

Either way, thanks for a great torrent ^^"
