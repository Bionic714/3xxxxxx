   The War of 1812 is a tactical/operational level game covering the major
   battles of the War of 1812 from the pre-war Battle of Tippecanoe to the
   post-war Battle of New Orleans.  The game includes the same detailed
   tactical game engine as the earlier game Campaign 1776 and a higher level
   campaign game so that a player can fight individual battles or campaigns.
   Over 100 historical and what-if battles are included in the game together
   with a full-feature scenario editor.
