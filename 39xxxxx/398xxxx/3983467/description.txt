    The Blender Texture Disk features over 500 original textures and pre-made Blender materials compiled with the artist in mind. Compiled and produced by our own Blender artists, this carefully developed collection of high quality image textures, animated textures, materials and plug-ins is the ultimate extension for your Blender. It will allow you to create stunning images and animations faster and easier than ever!

    A 12 page step-by-step guide for using the textures and materials in Blender is included with The Blender Texture Disk; so getting to work with these textures is a breeze.

    Of course, the contents can be used in any creative software package that supports either the JPEG or TARGA image file format, making them suitable for general-purpose 2D & 3D computer art and animation, and include woods, metals, cloth, nature, patterns, skins, reflections, international signs and animated textures.

    You know it's the perfect addition to your 3D library.
