,dirty_cousin,2008-02-09T00:13Z,This is so cool what you did for us.  Unfortunately I only have CD swap magic not DVD.  To add further BS to the situation I can't burn my own compilations with this god damn mac os x.  I don't wanna sound greedy or pushy but dude it would be so sweet if you could make a two part CD-R compilation.  At least I would think you're the shit.  Thanks for even considering it :).
,dirty_cousin,2008-02-12T03:22Z,sweet sweet sweet thank you so much man!!  All the Kick Ass GAMES!!! Yes I'm in retro heaven!!!  Thank you so much man very much appreciated it seems other people are using it as well so cheers you are the monster mack!
