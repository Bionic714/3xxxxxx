Sega Genesis for Ps2 ( http://pgen.gamebase.ca/downloads.php ) . I made this Image with Nero, but you can use any program to burn it, as long as it burns image files. I use Dvd Decrypter which is free and is found here http://dvd-decrypter.en.softonic.com/   I suggest you burn this to DVD, as I did not test this with a CD-R. It was made for DVD so Burn It to a DVD. You can play it on PS2 assuming you have a ps2 that has a MOD-CHIP or you are using a SWAP DISC and some kind of boot method. It includes 948 games, I tested and it works great, although there will be the odd rom that will give you problems, it is a compatibility issue.
Zombies ate my neighbours for example loads fine but will not respond to the button control.
