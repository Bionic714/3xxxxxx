,Volcanthegreat,2011-05-26T15:47Z,I was looking for C++. Its way better than C language. Seeding it :)
,jester995,2011-08-27T01:14Z,"Volcanthegreat, erm, no, it isn't. Why do beginners feel so compelled to make bold, uninformed statements? The C++ language is a fucking disgusting mess. Google around for Linux Torvlad's opinion on the matter. Linus is never wrong."
