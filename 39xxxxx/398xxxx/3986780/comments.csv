,royk259,2008-02-04T16:45Z,sorry - I'm a nuB - how do I get the subs to work?  I assume that's the srt file - 
,royk259,2008-02-04T17:25Z,"Not so nuB after all - I figured it out.  If anyone else has trouble with it, I did it like this - Using Divx player, use the file/open option, select the movie file, then select the .srt file - I will see if there is an option to do this in the Veoh player.

,lozory,2008-04-16T23:25Z,can someone please give the imbd link or say which version this is? is it the one by Neten Chokling or the other one (that isnt even on imbd)
,lozory,2008-04-18T11:44Z,"OK just downloaded it, 
its this version http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499238/
all good and the quality is excellent, includes working English subs, here are some specs:

File: 1.17 GB duration: 1:31:35, type: AVI
Video : 1384 Kbps, 23.976 fps, 720*400 (16:9), XVID
Audio : 448 Kbps, 48000 Hz, 5.1 Surround

.. not sure about those audio specs (the bitrate?) thats what AVI codec gave though"
,fbsnow,2009-12-10T20:49Z,"audio bitrate is high because it is 6 channel audio, so its ok, ""codec was right"""
