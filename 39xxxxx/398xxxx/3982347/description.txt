Endless travelling, constant noise of the parties, life in hotels, as well as a considerable dose...

...of couch-surfing, has accumulated in Penta\'s head into something that resembles the chaos of Indian street traffic. Horn Please - the message that is written on the back of the sub-continent\'s trucks could never been more appropriate to describe the desire to bring order to trance musician\'s life.

This CD, executed in the style of a Mumbai taxi, is a dedication to the crazy party life in the form of a collection of morning and night psytrance tracks, sometimes written in headphones in different parts of the globe, and already successfully tested on the biggest dance floors of the planet. Faster BPMs than in his previous albums, as well as the use of the latest technologies, makes \'Horn Please\' one of Nikita\'s most psychedelic works to date.
