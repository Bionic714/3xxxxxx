Jagged Alliance 2 
Linux Version

Great game^)


UPDATE:

This version is old 'native' Sir-Tech linux port, it doesn't work normally on modern linux distributions (some sound problems etc).

Just use JA2-Stracciatella from http://tron.homeunix.org/ja2/ with original resource files, it works pretty good.

I'm not sure, but i think that you can take resource files from this torrent.
