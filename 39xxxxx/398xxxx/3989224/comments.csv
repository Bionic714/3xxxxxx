,aikiflow,2009-07-20T07:07Z,I have enjoyed this game thoroughly through the years. Thank you for sharing it. I do have a question for anyone who may know. I have begun running debian PPC to play this game; I am unsure of what to do with the files downloaded here to install the game. Any help is appreciated. Thank you.
