The Mayan Calendar: The Evolution Continues 2005


This is the full DVD of Ian Xel Lungol's last recorded presentation, recorded in Sedona, Arizona in 2005.

As you will see, the quality of the DVD presentation is not that great, (so this is why I have decided to upload the full DVD rather than compress it as an .avi file.) But the information is ... superb!

Ian quickly goes over the Mayan Calender, [you can see his earlier presentations for more information and detail about the calendar itself.] 

But most importantly, Ian explores the question of "What's next?" after he gives us an understanding of the 'schedule' of the Mayan Calendar.

He also answers the issue of "How to personally prepare for the changes and the acceleration of consciousness, as we head towards 2012."
