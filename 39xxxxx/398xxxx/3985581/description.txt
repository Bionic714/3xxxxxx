Release Notes

This is the UK Release of the soundtrack for the new Johnny Depp
Film: Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.
Enjoy.

Now I know that some links for this album, e.g. Amazon, show that
this album has 20 tracks, the missing being Alms Alms, Ladies
in Their Sensitivities and Final Scene but this one was bought
from HMV and I have included proof that this one only has the 17
songs you find in this release.

This is because as you can see on the album it says:
Highlights From The Motion Picture Soundtrack
