Jack McLamb's association, Police & Military Against The New World Order, has a singular goal to prevent those in uniform from being unwittingly used to enslave the people of free nations under the anti-God, anti-Freedom (United Nations-led) world government system. The globalists intend to gain, through any available means, total dictatorial control over all the peoples of the world. They cannot realize their goal if their would-be enforcers (police and soldiers) refuse to assist them in their treachery. "If police officers and soldiers will not enforce tyranny, it will never be enforced!"
