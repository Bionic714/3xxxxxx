,AnotherStranger,2009-09-08T01:02Z,"Cheers, as a Swede I can't stand dubbed movies, not even to Swedish, so great to have the original!"
,AnotherStranger,2009-09-09T14:13Z,"I'm afraid the audio gets out of sync a bit into the movie - not very strange as the audio is from DVDR http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3230260 and the video from DVD-rip http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3350500/ - why didn't you simply use the DVDR for both? It's not a lot out of sync, but still enough to make this feel kind of dubbed too..."

,KESThai,2012-08-07T02:15Z,"Somebody made a comment about the audio getting out of sync. I'd like to clarify having just finished watching this rip.

At around 70 mins the audio does indeed loose sync. But only for a few minutes after which it regains sync again. During the period it is out of sync there is but a few lines of dialog. It is not as bad as the other commenter remarks. Do not be put off by this it is a great movie and you should have no problem with this rip."
