RIP NOTES

It seems UFC just cant seem to get their HD PPV streams right. Yet again
there is Issues in THE STREAM. We checked both our bell and dishnet caps.
Both have the same problems @ 4m19s of Round 2 in the Gonzoga fight the
stream goes black/blue due to tranmission issues. This continues till
2m31s in the same round. So we're giving you a DSR rip for the missing
Time. Enjoy!
