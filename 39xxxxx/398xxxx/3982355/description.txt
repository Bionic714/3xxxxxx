I am unable to search these torrent so I can not read comments. If you have downloaded redbaron3d.zip file via torrent which I had created previously and something is wrong with data, do not delete just download rest of file via this torrent. I hope machine will check all pieces and overwrite those which differ.

on previous torrent there should be better traffic
