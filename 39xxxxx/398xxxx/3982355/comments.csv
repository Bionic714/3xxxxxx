,Bruno1979,2008-01-26T13:50Z,After awakening into beatyful sunny day I must admit I dont remember what kind of file is it. Nowadays Im playling COMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATOR 2: PACIFIC THEATER. Ive just need red baron for my psychological analyze to remember for a times when I had been playing first vesion of this game (1990s). 
,Bruno1979,2008-01-26T13:59Z,"At the first time I had downloaded game from that two trackers and everything was alright, I deleted the game and next time when I have been downloading  the game for the second time I create the torrent before I downloaded whole thing, thats episode of my first uploaded torrent ever, this is my second which Ive created after downloading whole thing. Crazy thing happend  I had downloaded whole thing before I really downloaded because of my two different torrents running in one time into one file COMPRENDE AMIGOS?"
,betoelbicho,2008-02-04T06:23Z,"if i burn the .zip files of the red baron 2 cd on a cd will i be able to play the game?

,mraix,2008-04-20T02:02Z,"""crack"" is not a crack, it is in the game.

,Deputy276,2008-11-27T20:52Z,Crap!! This the GERMAN version of the game. Nothing in English. 
,SuoliMysli,2009-02-15T22:59Z,Is this Red Baron II?
,garycooper,2010-09-09T02:05Z,downloaded and installed. run exe and it asks for CD to be installed in drive. did what mraix above said and it starts up - but screen is black?
,garycooper,2010-09-09T02:06Z,would be better if had an ISO of this. then could just install from disc.
,Morpheus009,2010-10-30T21:18Z,Is there anyway to switch the language? I don't speak Red Baron.
,Najdihojca,2011-07-24T13:37Z,ITS GERMAN CRAP!
,BostonAl2012,2012-06-19T05:19Z,"Guys you probably need to download the Red Baron 3D toolkit to get this game to run corectly in XP/Vista/Win 7 etc.

There was also a couple of updates that add servers  and such.

Then there was some Mod Files that makes the graphics 2X-3X times better and even add planes.

Tool Kit is a must though.

Best,
