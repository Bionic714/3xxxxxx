Maybe in the next single issue pack or dcp pack ;) Thank you very much for the latest dcp!"
,bobbysocks313,2008-01-19T10:15Z,is tis one year old?
,whymenotu,2008-01-19T10:30Z,"DCP & Friends BLOW MONKEY DICK !!!!!!!!
They can't even come close to touching SBM.
DCP only gives out copies of the bullshit titles they they read, with SBM we got a multitude of choices in each pack, not some lame excuse for comics that get released 2-3 times a week each.
You can't get anything from DCP that's worth a damn, so folks, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."
,bobbysocks313,2008-01-19T11:30Z,And where do you hide this SBM pack? I haven't find any since 7th december 2007
,whymenotu,2008-01-19T11:51Z,"Due to the fact that DCP so openly advertises their garbage, the comic book industry has begun to seriously crack down on digital comic scanners. As a result SBM chose to get out of the game instead of ending up in jail. I guess the best we can hope for is the DCP team ends up locked away, so we won't have to put up with them any longer."
,bobbysocks313,2008-01-19T12:44Z,and where shall we get our digital comics then?
,SatanManofPeace,2008-01-19T16:40Z,"Yikes, the amount of shit coming out of whymenotu is astounding. DCP and the Minutemen do zero day comics. These are the comics that come out every week, therefore, making it impossible to claim that what they read is garbage, because they scan mostly everything that comes out.. If it weren't for them, there WOULDN'T be any comics. SBM *complied* their work, hence his thanks to the scanners, the aforementioned DCP and Minutemen. There are several other compliers, who are more than happy to take in request. It doesn't mean they have scanned the comics themselves."
,rummybottle,2008-03-03T22:00Z,"The half-pages 16-17 of ""Shadowpact 021 (2008) (RacerX-DCP)"" are badly scanned."
