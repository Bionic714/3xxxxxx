,billy1620,2008-02-02T16:39Z,Beware of the worm 32 virus attached the quicktax rar. I found it the hard way.
,Ratty696,2008-02-02T18:36Z,I garantee there is no virus.  I purchased quicktax and this is coppied directly from the disk.  There is NO virus!!
,billy1620,2008-02-02T21:11Z,My appologies to Ratty696. The torrent that infected my PC has been removed from the piratebay but still remains on other sites. The user *Antivirus Vendor* is still uploading infected files. *Antivirus Vendor* is changing their user name as comments are made on the torrent beware Mcafee 10 rar.

Thanks."
,Ratty696,2008-02-05T06:59Z,yes canadian!!
,billy1620,2008-03-02T01:27Z,Using the key provided in the comments I was unable to e file. Has anyone over come this problem?
,Pimpking,2008-03-04T05:16Z,"You probably won't be able to use efile, I know I couldn't in previous versions, but print it out and mail in it. Postage was $1.58 last year and there are free envelopes at any Canada Post location. "
,nathan130,2008-03-10T01:27Z,"anyone else having issues with printing?
i can't get save as pdf to show up, theres no print option in the file menu, and when i click print in the basic menu it never does and just leads me in circles with other screens!
very irritating."
,nathan130,2008-03-10T01:37Z,"when i try and save as PDF in the easy step version it says my return cannot be printed until quicktax has been updated. to update quicktax, blah blah.
i updated it, and tried several times again afterwards even when it says its fully up to date.
still nothing."
,yukteshwar,2008-03-10T05:23Z,"This does not work! Cannot print, cannot efile, cannot save as pdf file. Don't waste your time as I did."
,nathan130,2008-03-12T02:29Z,"i went to my post office and picked up some of the forms.
now just copying it out by hand from how quicktax filled it out.
still a pain in the ass, i was hoping to print this."
,rocky2006,2008-03-13T17:25Z,"There is a patch that works with Feg 6th update, but not with Feb 28th update.  

Just search the net ... or wait and likely another patch will surface."
,ronjon,2008-03-27T01:00Z,"rocky2006 is correct.  Works fine with the Feb 6, 2008 update. You can save PDF and print.
