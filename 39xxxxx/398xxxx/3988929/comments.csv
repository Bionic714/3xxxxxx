,0Marxism,2008-11-25T01:52Z,"Is watching an explosion on your LCD dangerous?  no.

the LCD is ""smart"" enough to not try to display a signal is was not designed to show

this DVD CAN NOT damage the LCD.... unless you break the DVD into pieces and gouge the surface of the screen like a knife.

Since this is a pirate copy of the commercial version sold by LCD-Screen-Cleaner  any damage allegations are equally true of the product you would be wasting your money on... d'oh.

not dangerous... believing FUD can be.
