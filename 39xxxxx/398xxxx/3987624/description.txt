Since its 1990 debut, ABC's long-running reality-television series, AMERICA'S HOME VIDEOS, has served up hilarious homemade video clips of bloopers, pranks, and mishaps made by the eccentric characters that populate the American landscape. NINCOMPOOPS AND BONEHEADS presents a collection of clips showcasing intrepid souls both brave and stupid enough to attempt especially dangerous stunts like riding grocery carts down a grassy hillside.
