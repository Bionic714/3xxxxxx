Klaus Wunderlich. 
For people with musically fine-tuned ears and broad accept of music.


The Hammond organ Klaus used is a very heavy analogue electro-mechanical piece of musical instrument which produces a somewhat unique sound. To every different note produced there is a tonewheel spinning generating the sound. The drawbars, vibrato, percussion clicks and more provides endless combinations and variations of sounds.

Set the sound aside for a moment and listen to his clever interpretations. You'll soon notice what he often commented; he didn't like angry, agressive music, but music that would rather cheer you up and put you in a good mood.

The recordings are multitracked, but considering this was done at the end of the 60ies with analogue tape recording equipment it's quite impressive. Other than the Hammond, the lineup consists of guitar bass, rhythm guitar and drums.

Mixed into the medleys you find songs very popular at that time like Hey Jude, Early in the Morning, Aquarius (from the musical by the same name), Honky Tonk Woman and Oh, Happy Day.
