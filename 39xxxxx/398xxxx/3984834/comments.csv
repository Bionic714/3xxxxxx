,KrS-OnE,2008-01-21T02:59Z,"I burned at 6x with imgburn, for some reason 2.4x wont work with IExtreme 1.4. But burning at 6x works fine for me"
,chuckstaton,2008-01-21T09:18Z,"Hey thanks for this slutsta. How come there are so many PS2 ISO's of custom GH games but almost NO 360 ones?
You can just port the songs over if you know how. I wish someone would make a few that are like the PS2 ISO's! "
,jonisz,2008-01-21T14:05Z,"THANKS ""KrS-OnE"" ill give it a try to burn faster. does every trax works for you? and ill go with ""chuckstaton"" it would be nice with more (hackes) 360 GH's. i have seen a torrent for a while ago that have the tools for doing songs, but i guess someone with real ears could do it way more better than us """"SVENSSONS"""" he he.. try to burn it faster, and come back with replay :) thx again man.. love it.."
,jonisz,2008-01-21T16:39Z,"now i have burn another copy at 6¤ speed, but still no responce on many of the trax. or 3-4 of them.. but i saw a thing that could bu the prob.. my discs is only compatible up to a wrightspeed of 2.5¤. can that be the prob??"
,Kjonge,2008-01-22T18:13Z,"Some tracks don't work ok :(
But a great job however on the tracks that DO work, i had a lot of fun with it, thanks!"
,Bradbeard,2008-01-23T00:38Z,"Don't waste your time on this one, guys... many songs have a REALLY shitty sync and some songs don't work at all.  There are better compilations to be had."
,ozzy_jonas,2008-01-24T19:56Z,Jag får bara fram de gamla låtarna. Inte dessa va gör jag för fel??

,bohboh,2008-06-21T16:50Z,seed!!!
,Sarcasm83,2008-10-15T10:15Z,"oorocker76, seatre;

The xbox 360 needs to be firmware flashed so it plays burnt discs. Unfortunately, it won't work without the ""mod"". But it's not a hard process to those who know how to do it - so I bet someone can do it for you, for a small fee, since it doesn't require any hardware installations, just a quick DVD drive flash.

Study it from google, you'll get all the info you need if you just look for it."
,Sarcasm83,2008-10-15T10:19Z,"Oh yeah and someone COULD actually seed this. It doesn't seem to even connect right now and it's pretty unlikely I'll ever get it at these seeder/leecher ratios :/

Hell, I bet alot of people have just snatched this and stopped upon completion... FAIR PLAY :("
,adamruddock,2008-10-21T17:53Z,lawler999 can u tell me how u burn your games because myn never seem to work yes ma 360 is flashed .also does it matter what burner u use
