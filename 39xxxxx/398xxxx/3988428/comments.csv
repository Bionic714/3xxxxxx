And unlike most swordsman movies, Sword Stained with Royal Blood has a huge diverse universe of characters all with a back story, with an intelligent storyline and a bitter-sweet denouement with the love story between Yuen Biao and Man Cheung.

The Sword Stained with Royal Blood is an uncommon piece of swordsman style move. Assured, intelligent, patient, meditative and different. "
