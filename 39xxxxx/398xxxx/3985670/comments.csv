,SiLENT_RiP,2008-01-21T03:00Z,My apologies - a disk crash has caused a brief pause in seeding; all will resume within a few hours at most.
,hanime22,2008-02-22T01:05Z,"Hi Silent_Rip,
I hear Audio at the Menu level but complete silence when the movie plays.  Is this a silent rip or what :) Please Help!"
[T],minOdroL,2008-03-06T19:58Z,Can some1 confirm that this one works?
,jeewee97,2008-05-18T04:05Z,"On my dvdplayer indeed it's a silent movie.
Apparently the DTS audio format is not for cheap players. On my computer,
Power-DVD 5.0: silence!
IfoEdit 0.971: I can see and hear."
,agentblond,2008-12-21T23:22Z,"Yeah, no audio on my computer, haven't tried it on my dvd player though. Is there a way to change the audio codec? I'd appreciate it."
,rhflem123,2009-01-24T03:59Z,Ditto No Sound. Please fix.
