This is book 4 of Jim Butcher's Codex Alera series, called Captain's Fury.  It is not a professionally produced audio book.  My wife took a pdf scan of the book found on here, converted it to rtf and ran it through Textaloud.  The book is split into chapters, with chapter 00 being the prolouge.  She used the voice actor Paul.  It is mp3 format, mono 32 bit 44,100.  We haven't listened to it completely, so something might be messed up.  If a file is missing or wrong in some way, let us know so we can fix it.  This was a lot of work for my wife, so I think it is nice of her to want me to put it out there for everyone.
