Yes, it would be nice with more information from the uploader.

Rexus4Real, you are correct, ""The Omega Man"" from 1971 starred Charlton Heston. But the first movie based on the novel ""I Am Legend"" by Richard Matheson is ""The Last Man on Earth"" from 1964 starring Vincent Price. They, including   ""I Am Legend"" starring Will Smith, are all movies based on the same novel."
