Release Notes:

Synthmaster Kevin Dooley presents his third full length Waveform release and follow up to his highly praised debut work \'ZerO One\' and second stellar \'protOtype2\' title with a continued ascent to new heights in both sound quality and compositional technique, while remaining true to his distinctive style. Zero: That point from which positive or negative qualities are systematically measured: the first of which would be a single unit such as One. ONE: Characterized by unity; forming a whole. 01: The basis of all binary digital language.
