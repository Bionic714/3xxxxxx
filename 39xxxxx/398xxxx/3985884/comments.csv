,tobytucker99,2008-02-05T00:49Z,"Thank You! Thank You! But...If this is the ""final"" *fixed* version, perhaps it should be labeled as v3.0 just to avoid any confusion. "
,curryman23,2008-03-16T03:29Z,"Many thanks to Dim for this great series, and extra special thanks for starting over, since I missed it first time around. Keep up the good work!"
,aREEDa,2009-02-04T03:37Z,"Wow, dimlan. Thank you so much! Sorry it took me so long to comment, I'm up to chronology #8 now. All the books I could never dream of affording and reading growing up in the 80's.. All the stories I always wished I knew. Thank you so much. It means more than I could ever say. "
