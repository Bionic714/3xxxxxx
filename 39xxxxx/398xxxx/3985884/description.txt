Starting again at the beginning. Actually this is more like version 3.0 since it fixes files found by PaulWantsToPlay, but if you downloaded v2.0 and the fix packs from ZCult you don't need v3.0, or if you downloaded v2.0 but don't mind some minor errors. With disk 1 the only difference is with file "058 Tales of Suspense #44"

Sorry about the confusion but this right here should be the final version.
