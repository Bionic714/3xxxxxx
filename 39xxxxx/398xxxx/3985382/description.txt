This is the story of a very poor family, living on a boat on the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok. 
Husband and wife, sister of the wife and a young child of the couple. The woman is beautiful 
and wants to have a better life. She suddenly  leaves her family and meets people who try to 
trick her into prostitution, by saying she will get a movie career. Meanwhile the husband tries 
to find her with the \"help\" of a taxi driver who only wants to make money from the man. This indeed 
looks like a basic storyline, but many people in Bangkok are very poor and these people will believe 
anything if somebody promises a less poor life. The part of the taxi driver is actually taken from a 
real life story.

 The drama is filmed beautifully, completely on location. Traditionally, early Thai drama movies do 
not show much sex or cruelties, they concentrate on the heart of the story.Those who know Thailand well 
should see this movie anyway, others should see how life of the poor in Thailand can be and how the poor 
are abused by the rich. I find this a brilliant real-life drama.
