[T],FaeGiN,2008-08-03T20:35Z,"Thank you!
I am so slow when it comes to knowing what games are around...I only just heard about this and then struggled to find any good download of it.  I already downloaded a Russian language version twice now..one on a torrent and one on a bunch of RS links.
so finally I find it, the good HOODLUM release too.
Nice!"

,Arballisk,2009-01-03T09:47Z,Can someone please explain in an easy-to understand manner how to run this?  I had no idea that this was a .nrg file so I am at a loss as to how to handle it.
,kainmcloud,2009-01-07T06:08Z,"A .nrg file is another form of Iso for image file format therefore it can be handled like any other Vdisk In other words download deamons tools
and mount the nrg and it will play like any other 
disk just digital"

An error (-5009 : 0x80040505) has occurred

Please make sure you have finished any previous setup and closed other applications.

If you are facing problem with reading the image file with Magic Disk or anything else convert the image to .iso format using Ultra Iso.

,citizenx83,2010-02-10T04:27Z,"For all of You who have problems with instaling (insert disc1 and so on) do this. In Psychonauts folder that u have extracted with winrar (not mounted) is zipped:
patch.exe 
Psychonauts.exe

copy patch.exe to C:\Program Files\Double Fine Productions\Psychonauts double click on it. let the process be done (10 sec aproximatly) and then overwrite Psychonauts.exe to the same folder. game works !"

,EpicSkillz,2010-12-02T13:55Z,"I Click Install Psychonauts and the box dissapears and nothing happens, any help?"
,fairydude,2011-02-26T17:32Z,"To anyone having trouble getting this to work this is what I did. 

After Extracting files (WinRAR) the Psychonauts.nrg is the file you need to mount, however, it wouldn't work properly with MagicISO until I renamed it Psychonauts.iso the file is already and ISO file you just have to rename it no conversion needed. 

After that install the patch. 

Then when you are suppose to overwrite the file to the installation folder (C:\Program Files\Double Fine Productions\Psychonauts) I got the error people are talking about so what I did was to move the original Psychonauts.exe file to a folder on my desktop just to get it out of the way then I moved the Replacement Psychonauts.exe to the installation file and it worked no error message. 

Just remember not to mix the two files up. You can delete the original one as you no longer need it. (Actually just deleting it right out of the installation file in the first place before putting in the replacement would have worked just as well)

Most people will figure this out just wanted to give a heads up for anyone having trouble with it."
,conqvict,2011-03-20T12:57Z,I'll try this game so if it is good I will buy it on steam in order to thank the developers for giving me such pleasure playing it and to encourage them to make Psychonauts 2!! :P
,poo4532,2011-04-18T02:01Z,"Works great, thanks for the upload.  Simple install, just copy over the patched exe's off the img after install and done.  If you still can't figure it out, you're an idiot...just buy the game."
,48gamer,2012-01-07T00:25Z,works like a charm thanks i will be sure to seed :D
,SourPussPro,2012-05-08T22:42Z,"works on vista! 
took me a while to figure out, being my first time dealing with .iso files, but was able to.
Thank you so much Fallcore!"
