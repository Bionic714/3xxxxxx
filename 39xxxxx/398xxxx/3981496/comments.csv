,john111111111111111111111,2008-02-03T03:21Z,Some of the files only have the first 2 minutes of the song - are these just samplers? However some of the songs are fine.
,john111111111111111111111,2008-02-03T03:30Z,".. I'd just like to add it's a great torrent, must have been a lot of work  thanks"
,Aaron451,2008-04-10T22:45Z,what bit rate are these encoded in?
,Aaron451,2008-04-10T22:46Z,is it true only first two minutes of each song?
,luckyplatypus,2008-06-05T21:43Z,"Driving Rain and Standing Stone are the only two albums I noticed that have shortened tracks and aren't good. There is one live album that had every track title mislabeled which was fun to fix. Most of the files are on the up and up, though."
,luckyplatypus,2008-06-05T21:45Z,"The majority of the tracks are encoded at 160, however a few albums are different. I didn't check all of them but I assume none of them are worse than 160."

,XLage,2009-01-04T15:42Z,"Although it must have been a lot of work indeed, that shouldn't mean the data can be messed up, as in this case. Not only songs on Driving Rain and Standing Stone are shortened, there are many more albums where this is the case.

It's too bad, coz it can be a very nice torrent. Perhaps keesbury has the time to review his upload (with feedback from us??) and re-issue it."
,NoCode0680,2010-09-17T16:01Z,"Yeah.  I appreciate the effort, but more problems than it's worth.  On top of what the others have stated, the first album I opened up to take a look at was ""McCartney"" and it's missing 3 tracks, so I'm probably not going to mess with this any further."
,billysbragg,2012-03-01T16:06Z,This torrent goes from bad to worse..only option to download is via magnet now?
