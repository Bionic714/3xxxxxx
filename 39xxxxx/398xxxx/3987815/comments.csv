I uploaded a torrent that doesn't have any songs so it is much smaller. Just to note, I will be uploading a separate song pack later on if you are interested."

I am seeding the first music collection pack for Audiosurf, i hope you enjoy"
,Tophillious,2008-01-29T14:39Z,"It says that there is a new version to download. Not the box that pops up when just running the game, but after you hit Start. If u could make a crack for the latest version, thatd be badass."
,namelessted,2008-01-31T03:04Z,"yes, i know there is an update but there isn't a workaround for that. I am not the person that made this workaround, i just put the torrent together."
