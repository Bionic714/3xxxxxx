Alright, this video is:

The Hellacopters
Live in Bonn, Germany
April 12th, 1998

This a pro-shot video of The Hellacopters that was shot when Dregen was still part of the band.
8 songs and 34 minutes of pure Action Rock 'N' Roll. The gig was filmed in an icehall, when they were opening for KISS.

Ripped from a VHS, so the quality is not the greatest.
I included a short video sample, so check that out if you want to know more about what it looks like.

Setlist:
1. You Are Nothin'
2. Fake Baby
3. Born Broke
4. Like No Other Man
5. Hey!
6. (Gotta Get Some Action) NOW!
7. Soulseller
8. Another Place
