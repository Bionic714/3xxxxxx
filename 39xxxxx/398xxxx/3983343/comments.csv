,Exodus666,2008-01-21T22:20Z,"Im gonna guess this is another CAM.
Sorry, it looks like we will have to wait longer for that dvdr or screener version of this movie.
Fuck it i think ill just go see it at the cinema."
[T],despo1ler,2008-01-23T15:04Z,"if you have any doupts about an AVI format torrent you can start downloading it and once it gets to 5-10% you can try to play it in VLC media player(freeware) which will repair the file and will play a few scenes or at least a bit of the audio while a fake torrent will not be repaired and will just run through and show nothing but a moving slider, try it out for yuourself and you can delete those fakes long b4 they finish downloading and pls copy and paste this to any posts you suspect to be fakes, let ppl find out for themselves and we can at least make the movie company anti p2p campaigners job a little harder "
,johnquickdoe,2008-01-28T05:05Z,"despo1ler, it is true that VLC is good for checking films this way. However it does not always work, i'd say 75% of the time it's good. 

Some films (for some odd reason, anyone technical can explain it?) require you to download it all first before playing properly."
,mojopagoda,2008-01-28T13:39Z,"VLC will work where the movie file format does NOT have the ""index"" at the end of the file.  AVI has index info all the way through it, so VLC can reconstruct the index when ""repairing"".  Other formats have the index at the end - like WMV - so you have to download the lot before you can play it.  "
,Raulll87,2008-01-29T00:31Z,"CAM quality at its finest, so if you can watch CAM quality then this is your download, ill be waiting for the dvdscr or rip."
,Balfor,2008-01-29T14:34Z,"Ever notice how when a movie company has a shitty budget, everything happens in 'a small, midwestern town'... lOl

[T],pcconsultant2007,2008-02-10T13:54Z,"For those of you who think my uploads are FAKE...??? NONE OF MY UPLOADS ARE FAKE...!!! STUPID ASS!!! Im not some wanna be trying to pass of viruses or other bullshit to seeders or leechers like yourself alike... I do what I can with what I have to edit and convert at the time. Some are good, some are great and the rest is shit... Take it or leave it, or take your cheap ass to the theater to see the movie...!!! ESPECIALLY YOU BOSCHI. YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO SAY BUT DON'T HAVE A SINGLE TORRENT GOING ON ANY OF THE FORUMS HERE...!!! GO FIGURE...!!!"
,xCaptainMorganx,2009-01-04T05:47Z,"I just wasted my time with this download - it's not worth it. It's horrible quality. And mojo, you're incorrect. I used VLC and other movie players, it's definitely a CAM and VLC can't change that, .avi or not.

pcconsultant, I think what you should do from now on with your torrents is to *warn* would-be downloaders of the quality of the torrent. That is, afterall, what respectable uploaders do, is it not? "
,karenw,2009-01-11T09:13Z,Not good quality. The movie is dark and the sound is terrible. May be a screener/teaser or cam.
