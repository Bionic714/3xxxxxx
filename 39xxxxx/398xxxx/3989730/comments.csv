I know everyone loves to get music for free because they hate the RIAA and all that - I personally think that the tactics the RIAA use are despicable too. HOWEVER, this is my mate's band's first album and if you enjoy it, I'd love you guys to buy it.

Contrary to popular belief, not all record lables rip their artists off. Their's doesn't anyway, and I know that for a fact.

You can grab it off iTunes from February the 4th or go buy it in HMV/Virgin or wherever.

I wouldn't normally write stuff like this but I know first hand how much blood, sweat and tears went into producing this album and I think it's only fair to reimburse a great bunch of guys for their hard work.

Cheers guys and enjoy the album (preferably legally).

,tom1181,2008-02-04T19:45Z,"i have to agree with lawrencedudley89 hear with the  illigal music download business, 
being a music student myself, i fuly support the music indestry, but i like to listen to music before i purchace it, just incase i dont like it, then its wasted money,
so do what i do, get the tunes from hear or what ever, then if you like it, buy it, and delete the original downloaded file, and if you dont like it, delete it,
the music industry is slowly falling apart, due to illigal downloads, and there is just not much money in the music business any more, so deffinatly buy this album if you like it!"
,griffin831,2008-02-06T11:39Z,"super fast download thanks.

i agree that the music industry is falling apart due to illegal downloads but we wouldn't be very good pirates if we went and bought it after downloading it!!! still if i dident get it from here i would just steal it from somewhere else. i fucking love tpb.
oh arh me harties."
,lawrencedudley89,2008-02-08T15:55Z,"Each to their own I suppose...
I just wanted to point out the moral side of the story - these aren't faceless artists, and neither are they driving around in a rolls royce; They're a bunch of lovely guys from Yorkshire who drive around the country in a banged up van.

As for griffin831 - if everyone thought the same as you then there would be no more music to pirate..."
,kebaros,2008-02-12T00:05Z,If its any good I'll buy it.

,JessieWho,2010-02-15T08:32Z,"I totally think we shouldn't rip off these wonderful artists BUT...big but...I'm hella poor, so I try to redeem myself by spreading the word around about bands that I download. I'm like a druggie stealing drugs from the hospital, I can't live without music and being hella poor I can't afford to buy it. "
