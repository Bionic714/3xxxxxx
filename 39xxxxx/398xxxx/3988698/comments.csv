Any other subs?"
,De Coach,2008-01-25T00:32Z,Only dutch subs in original.
,mof456,2008-01-26T10:49Z,"Thank you so much.

How many series, and how many DVDs in each series?
Is there more to come?"
,De Coach,2008-01-26T13:47Z,"I'll stop seeding season 1 if this one is going steady and then I will upload season 3 (4DVD's) and that's it, more I do not have. Season 4 has just been released on DVD so I suggest we all go and buy that one on mass so that they will release the other seasons sooner. I think it?s sad to let a 20 year old series go to waste on the shelves."
