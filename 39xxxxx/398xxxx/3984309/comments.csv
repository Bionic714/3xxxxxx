,Besim_Kastrat,2008-02-28T05:02Z,"För att hitta Blue.Velvet[1986]DVDrip[Eng]-Kole undertexter, så finns det tyvär inte på svenska.
Är nog 16 Sekunders fel syknad på varje undertext jag hittat, och jag har hittat många.

Sen gick jag vidare till engelska, men där hadde jag samma problem, tillslut när nästan all hopp var ute, så hittade jag rätt version.

English translation :

Here is the only subtitle version for this rip

,Jenna_PT,2010-05-30T09:21Z,"Wow that was hands down the fastest download I've ever had!  I'm not even kidding!  I was getting an average of about 550-600 kb/s... It literally took all of about 15 minutes to download the whole movie, if that... definitely a record in my books!  

Even movies that I would normally say are downloading relatively ""fast"" usually take at least 45 min to an hour to complete, and most of them take MUCH longer than that!

So I guess what I'm trying to say here is THANKS to all the seeders and especially to the uploader!

Oh, and although I haven't watched the movie yet, I skipped through it quickly to check the quality and it looks/sounds great!  So thanks again for all the great work!!!  :o)"
