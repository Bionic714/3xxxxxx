The highest I can set it at is around 10kb but trust me, if you like this kind of stuff it's well worth the wait. "
,baker1958,2008-01-19T16:41Z,"Thanks a lot for sharing this!  But I'm getting a ""PROBLEM CONNECTING TO TRACKER"" error.  I see others are leeching and I can leech other torrents.  Anyone have any ideas?"
,Zifko,2008-01-19T19:43Z,"I'm not sure what that error is, never had that one before. Try to re-install the program you're using. It has to be on you're end as there's over 400 leachers."
,baker1958,2008-01-20T05:40Z,It just won't work but I do appreciate the efforts!  Hopefully it will show up somewhere else and I can snag it!  Thanks again for compiling and sharing this.  Looks like a gem!
