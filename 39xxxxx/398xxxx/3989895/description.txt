Stratos Dionysiou was a laika and elafro-laika singer whose heyday was the 1970s and 1980s.

Dionysiou was born in Nigrita, Serres prefecture, on November 8, 1935, to Asia Minor refugees Angelos and Stasa Dionysiou. At age 13, he lost his father.

Dionysiou went to work as a tailor and was married, at age 20, to Georgia Laveni. The couple would have four children. While still working as a tailor, he also appeared in night clubs in Thessaloniki where he had moved.

Dionysiou left Thessaloniki for Athens to further his singing career. He appeared in Nikaia night club "Asteras" with well-established singer Kaity Grey and in 1959 recorded his first song. The 24-year old singer was signed by recording company "Columbia" and started singing songs by Babis Bakalis, Kostas Virvos and others with some success. He next re-recorded older songs by laika masters such as Vasilis Tsitsanis, Yiannis Papaioannou, Giorgos Mitsakis and Manolis Chiotis.
He died on May 11, 1990 at age 54.
