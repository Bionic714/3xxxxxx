,XDJ,2008-02-14T18:08Z,"When I click on the .exe for the video Scratch Transition it says that it can't find VDJ installed on my computer.... What should I do?
Do I just need to copy the virtual Dj folder into my documents like you said and everything will work from there? Sorry it might be a stupid question but I really am not too sure.

Thank for your time dude and wicked upload BTW, you rock!"
,DOTOCM1,2008-02-14T22:01Z,"after you install virtual dj it will already put the folder in my douments  
just copy over the empty VIRTUAL DJ folder in my documents with the one i put together and all the xtra`s will work 

Just run virtual dj and click on config and you can change the skins and all the sound & video effets loaded 
"
,fullmetaljacket765,2008-02-21T02:59Z,"Does this pack has the skins:

thanks for your time 
Darren ."
,polaris01,2008-03-30T18:58Z,"@ Darren: Yes, you can use VDJ with X-Session pro, the map for this can be download for free from VDJ site, and you can edit it manually with notepad.

DOTCOM1: Thx a lot for this pack, it's very useful for me. But can you build 2nd vol of this pack, including new effects and plugins?
THX!"
,KingIssa,2008-04-04T02:18Z,My Avg professional edition found a trojan horse in this DOTCOM.exe
,DOTOCM1,2008-04-04T06:17Z,i use avg you fucking bullshiting cut so its not even a false positive so you are the only one out of thounsands that leeched this that reported this as a trojan ..WHAT A NOOB..TELLING LIES.
,DOTOCM1,2008-04-04T06:20Z,"or and i put this pack together so fuck you 

and if you downloaded the fake from gudrips4you then thats your fault cos that will be a trojan cos i was the one that reported it"
,DOTOCM1,2008-04-04T06:23Z,just noticed you have no torrents uploaded so you most likely a dirty spamer working for atomix the TIGHT ARSED COMPANY that won`t share ther skins SO I DO
,polaris01,2008-04-04T18:36Z,"DOTCOM1, so I must upload torrents, than you reply me? I don't work in Atomix, and YET i don't uploaded any Torrents. Especially, I want new mapper for DJC, TexZK Filters V1.0, Long Break V2.0."
,DOTOCM1,2008-04-04T19:38Z,I was talking to KingIssa not you man he reported this as a trojan 
,markose_alex,2008-04-07T20:54Z,"hey, some of the plugins do not work.. how come? wuz usin the cdj1000 skin.."
,polaris01,2008-04-11T14:21Z,"@DOTCOM1: ok.

@markose_alex:
1. This pack has installers of plugins and extracted plugins. So you can use extracted plugins that can't be installed. Note: some old plugins doesn't work with new version (4 or newer)
2. Read post of DOTCOM1:
"" @XDJ Any one who gets the error installing the red plugings just extract with 7zip and intstall them that way"". This post is also for you...
3. In description of installer you have instruction to put this folder into ""My Documents"". So if you do that, you musn't install anything"
,markose_alex,2008-04-11T16:33Z,"thanks polaris01! will check it when i get back home.

Anyone know any good dj'in videos? tutorials maybe..?"
,Khops,2008-04-19T07:09Z,"Hey dotcom, AVG free edition THATS FREE EDITION found a virus name Trojan horse Generic10.CWD in c:\system Volume Information ... and C:\Program Files\Atomix Virtual DJ\Atomix Virtual DJ 5.0\...
either AVG FREE EDITION is shit or your file contains a TROJAN HORSE!!! By the way I dont know what a Trojan Horse is buy AVG FREE EDITION DOES BECAUSE IT NOW SHOWS UP IN MY VIRUS VAULT.. If you or those that dont believe me, how about I post a link to photobucket of MY PRINT SCREEN??? Let me know and I will post proof pictures because my laptop serving me years of service is worth more than this trojan horse ridden program!!!"
,DOTOCM1,2008-04-21T07:20Z,"Well i am using free avg to see if your right and not even a false poistive but avg sometimes picks up some packing software i use and toed + subzero reported the same problem think i will reinstall a new virus checker myself as no other checker reports my packed exe`s as virus`s  the more i use avg the worse it gets and its the same if you get the licenced version it sucks .but trust me man this pack took me a long time to put together
so do you think i will fuck it up a stick a stinking virus inside no thanks!!

if you have a virus in system volume infomation 
you need to disable system retstore restart
run full virus scan {i do in safe mode for nasty virus`s}
them restart enable system restore 
after restart then create a new restore point
run a quick scan to make sure its gone
