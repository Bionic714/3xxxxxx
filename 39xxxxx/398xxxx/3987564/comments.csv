,vlasvlasvlas,2008-01-22T13:07Z,"few days ago was full of fakes,

now is full of different cam versions



anybody knows whats the BEST cam version so we can all work with that one ? cause its gettin hard to choose the best cam version!"
,stu22aus,2008-01-22T13:17Z,"ok I really don't want to complain but the Filmer or someone very close to him was chowing down on popcorn like a friggin camel.

But it's genuine and while it's watchable (depending on who you are) I would recommend waiting for a screener or cam with plug-in audio...

Audio 2/10
Video 3/10"
