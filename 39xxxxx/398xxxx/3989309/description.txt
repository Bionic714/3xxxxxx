This is an echii parody fansub of the first Maria-sama ga Miteru OVA.  The subtitles have been re-written to imply that the members of the student council are in formalized sexual relations to each other and that Yumi and Sachiko take recreational drugs.  Although sex is talked about a lot, there is no bad language.  Sex scenes are referred to, but the Sorry, Missing Reel gimmick (from Grindhouse) is used to explain why the sex scenes are not there. If you are familiar with the series you might either think this is raunchy fun or a sacrilege.

Notes: In the preview for the next OVA (and in a couple places during the OVA) the Boy's school student council are referred to as perverts and cross-dressers.  This is because (in this alternate universe) the boys school has a student council qualification system that they stole from the anime Princess Princess.

The other show that Yumi's plan declaration would have been appropriate for is Revolutionary Girl Utena.
