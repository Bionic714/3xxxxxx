,@ll@n,2008-01-16T19:24Z,Nice..thanks for the upload. I love Limewire
,capt.night,2008-01-17T17:08Z,"Hmm this could be nice. But remember that it doesnt conclude the file safe just because avast didnt find virus ;). 

I can understand nor see why making virus torrents is so much ""fun"". Well i understand when big companies hire hackers to do so but why ""our"" people who enjoys the same piratism as us??"

If you don't like the program, then don't download it.  There is nothing wrong with it, it is NOT A VIRUS OR A TROJAN.

I call bullshit on all of you.  Saying things like that is just as bad as the virus hoaxers out there.  People depend on these comments to know whether something is safe to download and use, and it is not fair to hmj, who in good faith offers an excellent download to us, to come here and blatantly lie.  You have no clue.
