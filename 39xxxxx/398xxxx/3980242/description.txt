Ugh!

Another hard one to find without viruses and other crap! I had trouble finding a LimeWire Pro 4.14.12 that wasn't zipped, password protected, and full of viruses. Now this one too! I looked everywhere for this one. Hehe, lucky my friend signed up for a year of free updates on his LimeWire :)

My policy:
I don't submit infected files because like you, I want honesty.
When I post software, it's because I've tested it myself and at my
own risk to my files and computer.


This file was scanned with:
"Avast Home Edition 4.7 Build: Dec2007
(4.7.1098) Virus Database file 080116-0 updated 01/16/2008"

I scanned file before installation and computer was scanned after installation. Both clean.

-HMJ





One more thing, if see this same torrent inunder the user "hmj" that's me.... If you see any other user uploading my file, don't trust it. The reason why _hmj is my user name here is because "hmj" was taken :( So for LimeWire PRO hunting here, look for _hmj and if you are looking in MiniNova, look for hmj.

I'm trying to make a good rep of my "hmj" user name.
