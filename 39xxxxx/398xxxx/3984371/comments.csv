,spacey1,2008-01-19T12:04Z,"This documentary is by far the best and most truthful synthesis of what is happening now in United States and in the World with the Bush administration. There are no rumors or anything that isn't based on solid basis.

You listen to historians, people that work with war victims, people working for the UN, journalists, etc. After listening to this documentary, you will get a solid view of the actual world, and a pretty good view of what will beginning to happen during the new century. There is simply no propaganda, no false information, no junk from fanatics over here, simply truth and always objectively presented.
