,wittious1,2008-03-09T21:11Z,How will the .nfo files affect this torrent? I don't really know what they are for will I need a special program to open them? Or do I even need to open them to view these?
,Raisehell,2008-04-24T10:13Z,"nfo files are release information, you can open it with programs like notepad. Doesn't effect the files you actually watch.

Anyway thank you for the second season!"
