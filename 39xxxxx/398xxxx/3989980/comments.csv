,ilive4harleys,2008-02-02T16:32Z,"We laugh and the actors get the credit. The writers are taken for granted. They are the rhythm section of the band...cannot get along without them and yet no one realizes they are there. The writers get the satisfaction of a country laughing at their material but the few actors get the f2f laugh and the heavy paycheck.
