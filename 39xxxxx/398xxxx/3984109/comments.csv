,DanWare,2008-08-07T20:21Z,"You can re-encode it using something like WinAVI or TMPGEnc.

Then you burn the DVD files as normal."
,doc_pennings,2008-08-22T21:48Z,"is this the last animation that was released ?
and if so then change the release date to 2008 !
cause the genre you wrote and the release date don't mix."
,doc_pennings,2008-08-23T12:39Z,"cheap { i think Korean } animation  , over the top actions "" even for star wars "" and  no storyline . 
if you really love starwars this will be a ripoff"
,Goldernie,2009-10-17T07:40Z,I've been looking for this! Tartakovsky is a genius! He's doing the storyline for Iron Man 2 guys!!!
,KLATUBARADANIKTO,2010-07-31T05:37Z,"@doc_pennings Dont worry, when you grow up you will understand why this was the best Star Wars series."
,KLATUBARADANIKTO,2010-07-31T05:38Z,"@doc_pennings This is not Korean animation, its American, done by the guy who made Samurai Jack and Dexter's Lab. You fucking retard man, its 100 better than that new CGI bullshit."
