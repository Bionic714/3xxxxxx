"INTRODUCTION

Demonstrated by Ma Shiyong, gold-medal winner of National Traditional Martial Arts Contest of China.

Brief Introduction:  Taiji Plum-Blossom Mantis Quan is a set of unique mantis quan that is different from others.  The famous master, Ma Hanqing in Beijing, elaborately developed and improved it into a kind of unique quan.  Its movements are active and quick, very changeable; attack and retreat freely and skillfully, with spirit and forms combined.  Each movement is practical, especially elbow techniques, including overlap elbow, stick elbow, hook elbow, block elbow, butt elbow, turning elbow, straight upward elbow, etc.  It is a set of practical pictographic Quan."
