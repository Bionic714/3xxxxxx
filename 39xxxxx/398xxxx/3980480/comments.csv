So, first up, great big thanks for *PracticingTroublemaker*. Thanks, friend.

One of the rare rips I have where audio (782 MB) outstrips video (763 MB). Gee, only wish audio weren't PCM... in which case it would've beena  normal sized rip. "

@zeina.. I'm very glad that some recordings actually sound as good as the original recording.. and not carried by some weak mp3 or other compressed audio track which looses both quality and realism.

thank god for people with sense and good hearing.

thanks Practicing Toublemaker"
