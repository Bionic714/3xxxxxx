Richard Diamond, Private Detective, was originally a radio program from 1949 to 1952, created by famed writer/director Blake Edwards and starring Dick Powell, who was also the producer. Too busy to do the TV series in 1957, Powell hired a young actor named David Meyer to play the role, but suggested he change his name to the more exotic David Janssen. The show ran on CBS for the first 3 seasons, but for the 4th season switched to NBC. In syndication, the early episodes of the series were retitled Call Mr. 'D' and had different theme music.
