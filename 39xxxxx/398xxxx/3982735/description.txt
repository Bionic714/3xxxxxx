The electrifying new novel from the author of the New York Times bestsellers 
The Lincoln Lawyer and Echo Park

----

A body has been found on the overlook near Mulholland Drive. The victim, 
identified as Dr. Stanley Kent, has two bullet holes in the back of his head 
from what looks like an execution-style shooting. LAPD detective Harry Bosch 
is called out to investigate. It is the case he has been waiting for, his first 
since being recruited to the city\'s Homicide Special Squad.

As soon as Bosch begins retracing Dr. Kent\'s steps, contradictions emerge. 
While Kent doesn\'t seem to have had ties to organized crime, he did have 
access to dangerous radioactive substances from just about every hospital in 
Los Angeles County. What begins as a routine homicide investigation opens 
up before Bosch into something much larger and more dangerousÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½and much 
more urgent.

Breaking in a new rookie partner and chasing his first fresh case in years, 
Bosch is soon in conflict not just with the LAPD brass but also with FBI 
hotshots who are convinced that the case is too important for the likes of the 
LAPD. Harry\'s onetime lover Rachel Walling is among the federal agents 
frantically working the case, making Bosch\'s job all the more complicated. 
Guarding one slim advantage, he relentlessly follows his own instincts, hoping 
they are still true enough to solve the crimeÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½and to save all of Los Angeles 
from a deadly hazard.

Masterful, taut, and pulsing with high-octane suspense, The Overlook shows 
once more that \"among contemporary crime writers, Connelly is, quite simply, 
the best of the best\" (Philadelphia Inquirer).
