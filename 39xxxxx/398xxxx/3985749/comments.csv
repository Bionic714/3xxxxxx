,Tarl,2008-01-22T02:31Z,Actually I downloaded it again and ALL is GOOD
,juststosh,2010-04-06T02:33Z,"Video: 8 Audio: 9  Video gets kind of pixelated during action on larger screen in my experience.  A and V seem pretty well synced.  Better than the other ""Soldier"" out there by ""schon"".. I think was the name which has more seeders but is way out of sync ~30mins into it.  This one is very watchable.  Thanks.  Lets keep it alive since it may be the only watchable one out there (that I could find)."
