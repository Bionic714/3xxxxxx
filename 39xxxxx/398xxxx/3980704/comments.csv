(with divx players) problem that old FXG movies have.
The latest are tested, so don't waste any time trying to fix them.
Thank you for the support!!!!

,Toni0907,2008-01-22T05:50Z,"Hi FXG,
 Thanks for all of the movies. So far so good. I have a problem that maybe somebody can help me with. I like to stream movies from my computer to my PS3. I download the movie and convert it using a certified Divx converter but my PS3 says data not recognized unless I burn it to disk. Sometimes even then it says 'data corrupted'. The PS3 is a divx certified device now, so I don't know what it is. Any suggestions? Has anybody else had this problem? Thanks for any help that somebody can offer. Take Care. Any chance of getting the show 'Tracey takes on'? It was on HBO I believe. :-)

,ja_one,2008-02-05T02:16Z,"Good movie, brilliant acting from all.  A very disturbing film which looks at the one of the more sinister types of trade that go on in the Americas.  This is not a feel good movie but will make you feel. I feel horrified."
