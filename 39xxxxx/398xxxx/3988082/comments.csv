,dannychris,2010-04-14T06:38Z,"Richard Melville Hall (born September 11, 1965),[1] better known by his stage name Moby, is an American DJ, singer-songwriter, and musician.

He sings and plays keyboard, guitar, bass guitar and drums. Moby became a successful artist on the ambient electronica scene, and achieved eight top 40 singles in the UK during the 1990s. In 1999 he released the album Play, a mix of melancholic chill-out, ambient music, and upbeat electronica, that was critically acclaimed and produced an impressive eight hit singles (including his most popular songs ""Porcelain"", ""Natural Blues"" and ""Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?""). Play became a commercial and cultural phenomenon, selling over 10 million copies worldwide[2] (the best-selling electronica album ever) and with its eighteen songs receiving an unprecedented licensing in films, television and commercial advertisements.

His follow-up album, 18 (2002) was also successful, receiving positive to mixed response. His next offer, the mostly upbeat Hotel (2005) received lukewarm reviews and poor sales in general. Moby released his most recent albums, Last Night (2008) and Wait for Me (2009), finding good reviews and moderate sales. AllMusic considers Moby ""one of the most important dance music figures of the early '90s, helping bring the music to a mainstream audience both in the UK and in America"".
