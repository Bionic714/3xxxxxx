Every time I read the USA's various statements on the war between Russia and Georgia as highlights, I rigorously on eyebrows, so even today.

The United States is now becoming increasingly clear in its criticism of Russia's military intervention in Georgia. Meanwhile, fighting in the area temporarily ceased. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice now criticizes Russia for the way it acts in connection with the conflict in Georgia. -- Russia has several opportunities to change course and show that the country is trying to live up to the principles applicable in the twenty-first century, ""she says according to the news agency Reuters.

Secretary Rice also says that Russia's international reputation is at stake. ""

To hear U.S. Secretary of talk about who will live up to the principles that govern the twenty-first century must simply be a joke. For Condoleezza Rice can not reasonably believe in such a speech himself. Probably so she gave it on the radio so that it is not what it seemed to fit in a mungiporna. For the day that Russia has fallen just as deeply into the mire with folkr채ttsbrott, torture, illegal detention and mass extermination of Muslims is unlikely to happen.

Work is already under way in the United States to bring the George W. Bush before the national-or-martial, and it would not surprise me if we will actually go ashore with the task. The countries themselves feel that they have the right to exempt its military leader of the Hague court or other War Tribunal simply do not have the right to comment on how other nations should behave. So my image is selected with care, George W. Bush is like a tre책ring on a tricycle.

The Russians have definitely planned to show the military muscle to mark their nation's place and status in the region. Bush chooses to do the same thing in other continents settled a thousand times worse. So should we let our water over some political leaders in 2008 as George W. Bush must be the first to benefit from our combined effort."
