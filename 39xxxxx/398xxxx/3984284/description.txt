I may not be much of a country music fan, but when I do decide to listen to it, Randy Travis has always been one of my favorites.  This CD has a great collection of his best songs throughout his very successful career.  I ripped it from an actual CD, so quality is of the best.  Please seed for as long humanly possible.  Thank You.  SupermanGTR
