,baronsimms,2008-01-26T04:58Z,"this is the demo version, white noise interupts play every 30 seconds!!!!"
,womoma,2008-08-02T01:59Z,Sylenth mac cracked? when? where?
,Brewskie86,2009-05-28T18:42Z,"Dont know what baronsimms is even talking about, before you put the licence in the vst folder, its not white noise its a digial voice saying demo vers, or some shit. Once you put the licence file in the right folder, your good to go, full vers"
,GolemdX,2009-06-07T23:58Z,"I seem to be getting white noise every 30 or so seconds also, doesn't make me happy. This is the best I could find... no 2.0."
,GolemdX,2009-06-08T00:17Z,"Oops, I never installed a VST before, I thought it read from the installation folder, I forgot to copy the license. Everything works great!"
,McQueenTheSteve,2009-08-17T15:05Z,"I'm a complete idiot with installing VST's and the MSinfo documents won't open

Can someone give me a step-by-step to get this up and running?

cheers"
,deanokenny1,2010-01-04T02:53Z,ok where do you put the licence code??
,GetloudProject,2010-01-21T08:00Z,"I also get white noise every 50 sek. And i have put the licence file in the plugin folder. What exactly should you do with the licence-file to get it to work?
Thanks!"
,fp98,2010-04-03T17:42Z,this is the trial dude
,dannay,2010-08-19T01:21Z,"even with the DAT license file in the VST folder, it still does not work. anyone with a real cracked version??"
,Peardan,2011-03-30T01:58Z,"Works perfectly. How to install for windows 7:
Open Rar, do the set up, go to: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steinberg\VSTPlugins"" Copy everything in that folder to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\VstPlugins"" If the VstPlugins folder doesnt exist create one. Now put the Licence.dat into the Sylenth1 folder and wala
Thats how I got it to work for me. Thank you soo much for uplaoding this!"
,limedisciple,2011-04-05T05:59Z,"Thanks so much Peardan. Got it to work for me.
I'm also having white noise problems, how do i fix that?"
,Loco6969,2011-07-09T00:55Z,This is merely the demo version that you can download at the manufacturer's site. Nothing cracked here. 
,micmichael69,2012-01-29T07:35Z,I got the full version working thanks to Peardan but it doesn't have a menu.
,Moooog,2012-03-16T18:50Z,Great instructions by peardan this thing is a beast
,mbrissos,2012-03-19T18:46Z,"Everything's fine, and it is a full version of Sylenth.
I'm also getting problems with spontaneous white noise. Anyone found a way to fix it?"
