  Û Hello everyone, This is Mr. X here of RLSLOG.net, editor at the hottest  Û
  Û place on the web to get nfo about the latest "The Scene" has to offer.   Û
  Û Earlier in the month of January 2008 I thought it would be a cool        Û
  Û idea to create a compilation album of songs that are related to the      Û
  Û scene/warez topics we cover on rlslog.net. The notification of Scits     Û
  Û death provoked me to finish this album and have it ready for rlslogs     Û
  Û 2nd birthday. I hope you enjoy this.                                     Û
  Û									     Û
  Û I decided to choose some chip-tune songs from my outrageously large      Û
  Û collection that reflected sadness and loss. I then converted them to mp3 Û
  Û with normalized audio.                                                   Û
  Û                                                                          Û
