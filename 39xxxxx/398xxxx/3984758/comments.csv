,oktan,2008-01-19T15:40Z,There is nothing about this movie to recommend it...and a million reasons to avoid it like the plague...and you would probably have a better time with a plague.
,Fredrika2,2008-01-19T17:09Z,"oktan: that quote you took from the IMDB and it is one person's opinion on the IMDB. Average user rating is 5.3 out of 10; meaning some people like it. If one doesn't, it's easy to erase the file and download a gem like http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3574840/Loving.Annabelle.2006.DVDRip.XviD-NEPTUNE.avi"
,Torrentministern,2008-01-19T20:47Z,Thanks/Tackar ;-)

Thanks for your movies Fredrika2!"
,Fredrika2,2008-01-20T17:47Z,"oktan: so f***ing right I'm a lesbian! Aren't you? Too bad for you, then. If you're lucky, things may change for you and you'll some day realize that you're one too. 

I don't don't exactly find this film a very good one, myself, but to some girls there's something of value in it. Of course it's not for everyone, any more than ""Gung-Ho"" or ""Broken Arrow"" is. I just made it available to people who'd might be interested and your opinion is much less interesting than the average ""so-so"" rating based on fifty votes. "
,Fredrika2,2008-02-06T16:44Z,"Actually, having seen this film again, I must say I like it more and more. It really is sincere. And unless you know the message of it, it's that people are people. Lovers behave and treat each other in the way they would, regardless of their sexual orientation. Being a good human towards one-another has nothing to do with to whom you are attracted."
,piroredk1,2008-03-08T08:32Z,I just want to say thanks for all the movies!
,andreas32,2008-04-06T20:21Z,"Ditto, thanks for all the uploads. After Demonoid went down, I thought we'd lost access to non-pornographic lesbian themed movies. Finding all these yesterday, I've been in heaven."
,Trasmattan25,2008-07-26T10:00Z,"thanks or all
you are amazing
