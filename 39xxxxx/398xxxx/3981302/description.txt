This is an Iranian duo that played at a world music festival in Adelaide, Australia in 2007. A father and son, the dad played a type of bagpipe, it sounded amazing - very cool note intervals. Son played drums, and was pretty good - esp considering he only looked about 10 yo.

They put on a really good show. This is a bootleg, and is reasonable quality (not from the desk or anything tho) - there is some crowd noise, but the crowd is generally quiet during the music.

Later on in the festival, there was a huge jam session, and the bagpipe dude absolutely went off - so cool. The crowd loved him. Didn't get a recording of that, unfortunately.

I don't think they have a website, and I don't know much about them - haven't found any of their albums either. Check them out if you get the chance - they put on a great show!

I've also put a couple of photos from the gig into the torrent.
