,technimac,2008-01-29T22:30Z,"This is a great movie.  Excellent, vivid & accurate animation shows Miyazaki's knowledge of the area, aircraft and history of the region.
Highly recommended for adults, but kids will love it too.....only for different reasons."

,-MartijN-,2009-07-25T17:31Z,"Thanks for the share. I really enjoyed the movie untill it became twitchy at the end. The last 15 minutes of the DVD seem corrupt, so i didn't see the end yet. Too bad. I don't know if it's the file or my dvd-burner, but i burned it more than once and that didn't help. "
