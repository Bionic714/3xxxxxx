Nobody used to notice Frank Lucas, the quiet driver to one of the inner city's 
leading black crime bosses. But when his boss suddenly dies, Frank exploits 
the opening in the power structure to build his own empire and create his own 
version of the American Dream. Through ingenuity and a strict business ethic, 
he comes to rule the inner-city drug trade, flooding the streets with a purer product 
at a better price. Lucas outplays all of the leading crime syndicates and becomes not 
only one of the city's mainline corrupters, but part of its circle of legit civic superstars.
