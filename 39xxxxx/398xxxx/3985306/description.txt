I spent many years as a cast member of a RHPS shadowcast, and have often had requests from newbies for some of the music. Here are the albums from the box collection; including the original show, the film, rare titles, and the international album, along with a karaoke album, the new Broadway cast, and the famous participation album. I have also thrown in some weird little tidbits, including a film clip of the original trailer. If you want to find the cast nearest you, your best bet is still to check www.rockyhorror.com or www.cosmosfactory.com .
