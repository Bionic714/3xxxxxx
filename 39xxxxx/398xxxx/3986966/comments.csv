4. Copy the file inside
5. Find the program files for the game (if you don't know where to look, use 'search"")
6. Paste the file you copied, agreeing to replace the existing one.
7. Enjoy the game"

,FaJu,2008-10-26T06:15Z,"@Leokosta

There's really no need to go hunting for which specific one you need. Just install the K-Lite Codec Pack and you should be set for pretty much forever. It has anything and everything you will need.

Here you are:

The standard pack should be fine. It also comes with Media Player Classic if you want it."

,heshi.v.m,2010-12-19T03:23Z,"This is for those who are having trouble in installing and finding the crack....

Steps....
1.download daemon tools.

2.install (it requires a pc restart).

3.once it is installed run it.

4.on the system tray you will see the dt icon (a   whitish colour icon with a blue lightning bolt.

5.right click, select ""virtual device"">Device 0:[device name could be anything like ""j"",""k"". etc....>mount image.

6.Select the cd1 folder from your downloads location.

7.when the search box opens up select ""All files"" from the combo box at the lower right. not """"All supported images"".

8.then select the ""lotrtrotkplc-chwdgb.bin"" file and click on open. then the auto run will appear. install the game.

9.38NW-7ZCV-KYV2-HAB6-7DEV this is the serial key that I have. you can get serial keys from the net. it's everywhere.

10.when the disc 2 and 3 is asked, do the same thing that was done when mounting the cd1 and continue the installation.

11.after the installation there will be an error ""press ok and it will disappear"".

12.now from the disc 3 open the folder names ""CHwDgB"" and copy and replace the exe file that is inside of it to the LORTOK game folder.

13.ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!
