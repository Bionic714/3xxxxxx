Good though"
,rokridge,2008-01-19T08:30Z,I was expecting some sort of titalating b-movie but it's an art film about a prostitutes self image. I thought that it was pretty cool to be fair and it does contain full nudity a lot of puking and the main girl is a beuty... but a disturbing one. For me the first 20 minutes were enough.

,mannshands,2010-03-15T23:22Z,"Does not even qualify as a movie. Not good gore, horror, or plot. Not sexy or satirical. Absolute rubbish, bunch of clips thrown together by drunk teenagers. Mostly a bulimic chic puking in the toilet. "
