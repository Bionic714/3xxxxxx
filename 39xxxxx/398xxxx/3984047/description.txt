This is the same as the previous torrent by the same name. It is not actually an ebook but a series of lessons. For that reason I have also packed them in a RAR. This is a cleaned up version with duplicate files removed and the lessons have been numbered so they will appear in the correct order. There are tests at the end of each lesson but you will not be able to go online to check your answers. But, hey, you know when you know the correct answer and when you don\'t and can go back to the lesson to correct your mistakes.
