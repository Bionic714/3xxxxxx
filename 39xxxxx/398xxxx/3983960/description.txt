may be possible that some video files do not convert correctly.

If you have any problems we advise that you always download and install the latest
updates for Windows and your PC.

Some formats of video are protected by law, license or safeguards.  We do not
support infringement on any of these items and it should be noted that we are not
responsible for errors or problems resulting in attempts to surpass or work around
these protective measures.

Under some circumstances, USB may be unreliable. If after installing the latest
updates for Windows and your PC, plug the PC to PSP USB cable directly into the
USB port or try another port. Also try other USB devices to see if they experience
the same issue.
