,boris72,2011-04-21T10:14Z,This torrent is practically dead now. I found another direct download elsewhere to find it after hours of looking and looking on other torrent sites. I have left it going for two days now and have received nothing so Just thought I'd inform anybody trying to get it. It really is a shame because this is one of the best games ever.
