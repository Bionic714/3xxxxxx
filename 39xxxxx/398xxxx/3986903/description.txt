Game desc :
This is a game where it fits in all the genres of Strategy, Action. You can take control of one of 4 veichles, a jeep, helicopter, tank and a missle launching vehicle (but actually called The Armoured Support Vehicle (ASV)). While there are 2 ways to win, the easier one would be to capture the enemy's flag by bringing it to your bunker with the frail Jeep. And that is the main objective. The other way to win is to destroy your enemy. A secondary objective
