,eurodane,2008-01-17T18:14Z,is this the version where several scenes are missing? 
,rpm016,2008-01-17T18:21Z,To the best of my knowledge there are no scene deletions or omissions. 
,tarheel72681,2008-01-26T10:32Z,Is this a cam or sync? If it's a sync is the o e with the ending missing?
,TN674,2008-02-13T07:46Z,"Why is the file size so small, A, and B, can anyone confirm if this is the full movie, including the FULL ending, where Daniel says the best line in the movie?"
,TN674,2008-02-13T08:07Z,"Ah, nevermind, looked up rmvb, explained it all. And going by the sample, the quality is an ""A"". 

I suppose I'll download the entire thing and see if the ending is there."
,Hacksack,2008-02-21T00:07Z,Hope this is the full movie

,slavesonkorn,2008-02-21T00:30Z,I don't understand why I cannot find a good version of this anywhere. it makes no sense. and yes i would happily donate $12 to Daniel Day-Lewis but unfortunately mama doesn't have those kind of funds :P damn i wish i could see this!!!!
