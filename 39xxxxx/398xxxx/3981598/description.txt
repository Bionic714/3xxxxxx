THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a masterly, unflinching examination of a 
consummately evil man. Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is, as he 
likes to remind those around him, an oil man: he finds it, he drills for it, 
and he makes money from it. Following a tip from a visitor named Paul Sunday, 
whose family sits atop a veritable ocean of oil, Plainview travels to the town 
of New Boston, California, with his young son. Sunday?s preacher brother 
Eli (both roles by Paul Dano) grudgingly accepts Plainview?s ambitions under 
the condition that he help fund the town church. As Plainview?s plans come to 
fruition, a series of events begin to fracture the insular world he has constructed 
for himself, pitting Plainview against Sunday and forcing him to become even 
more vindictive and ruthless..

Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Kevin J. O'Connor, Paul Dano, Dillon Freasier, Ciaran Hinds.
