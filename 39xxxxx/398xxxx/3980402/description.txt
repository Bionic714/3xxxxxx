This is the original Burning Crusade Iso to update your WOW client to the expansion. If you need the original non expansion wow please check out this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3920181/World_Of_Warcraft_With_Patches

1. Go to www.knightslegion.com and select "Edit your account" From the drop down menu switch it from "original" to "expansion". If you require assistance please ask for help at our forums (http://www.knightslegion.com/forum)

2. Mount the ISO in any image mounting/cd burning software you prefer and install.

3. Patch to 2.3 (official patch)

4. Go to your WOW directory (default:C:Program FilesWorld of Warcraft)

5. Open up realmlist.wtf in any text editor (ie:notepad)

6. Change your realmlist so it looks like: 

set realmlist knightslegion.servegame.org
set patchlist knightslegion.servegame.org

Note: Setting patchlist is not needed but it helps so you dont accidentally upgrade.

7. Run wow.exe or the launcher and play for free using the same account details as the original wow.



We at Knightslegion welcome everyone to come enjoy the World of Warcraft with us and our many members. Hope to see you there.
