Pls be Specific .... what virus, with what program?"
,cancon1,2008-01-20T03:18Z,Comes up clean with Kaspersky AV.  
,isaacn86,2008-01-22T03:15Z,It might say it is a Virus because Keygens always come up as viruses.
,vudka,2008-01-26T05:18Z,"The real keygen real size is 215 040 bytes. I have scan it with the latest nod32.2008.1.25 and it is CLEAN.

,vudka,2008-01-26T05:29Z,forgot to thanks! :-)
,dianalov3,2008-01-26T06:43Z,"It works and it is not a virus. The instructions provided are useful. 
I had to keep running the installation program over and over again (3-4 times) so I could change the installation key. With some installation keys it may tell you that ""20 returns have already been filed"" or something like that. But if you keep trying to find a good installation key, it will finally work.
Thank you."
,arian_g,2008-02-03T03:43Z,thnx ;)
,darius242,2008-02-12T18:36Z,I have tried installing this but it does not work. It allows you to do your return but it won't let you print or Netfile.
,reflash,2008-02-13T03:32Z,same here no netfile
,deafdarkman,2008-02-15T22:00Z,"Is it safe to apply on register  Netfile with keygen, ?? Because I checked that keygen are funny number , if they see funny they will shut me off ? right  ???"
,darius242,2008-02-20T00:31Z,"deafdarkman, Pls see my comment above. You cannot Netfile with this one."
,frigger1999,2008-02-28T21:57Z,Has anyone been able to efile with this years quicktax?  I did last year NP.  You don't use the program to upload it.  All you do is upload the .tax file via the website.  So they can't tell you used q hacked version of quicktax.
,bwmcmaste,2008-03-08T02:51Z,"50 seeders and one leecher, why the hell can't I download this file?

It just keeps saying ""connecting""."
,rocky2006,2008-03-11T22:05Z,"Cannot print either now.  

There is a patch that supposedly works with the Feb 6 update but not Feb 28th."
