,RainbowDissent,2008-01-19T15:49Z,"Uploading any other Dax Riggs material on request. I have:

Acid Bath - both studio albums, Golgotha demo, Hymns of the Needle Freaks demo, Demos 1993 - 1996 collection, live bootlegs including Liquid Death bootleg, live readings of poetry.

Agents of Oblivion - self-titled studio album, five-track untitled demo, Endsville live show.

Dax Riggs solo - rough production mix of We Sing Only Of Blood And Love,  "
,RainbowDissent,2008-01-19T15:59Z,"(hit submit by accident)

Dax Riggs (continued) - 9-page .jpeg-scan book of poetry from his Acid Bath days with illustrations, cover collections and live shows.

T-Daks and his White Plastic Soul - Live at the Caterie, Angel in the Dope Smoke (.m4a).

Daisyhead and the Mooncrickets - The Skeletal Circus Derails Pt. 2, source-unknown 14-track poorly-recorded practise. I think this is all the recorded Daisyhead material that exists. 

deadboy & the Elephantmen - 2001 demo, If this is Hell I'm Lucky, We Are Night Sky, Song Mechanism EP, their first show on 21-12-2000 at Shanahan's, Velvet Songs for Golden Skulls live, couple of other live shows. 

Some of it's pretty poor quality, when it comes to Dax Stuff a lot of the time you have to take what you can get. "

,sardy,2008-01-20T10:15Z,"I should also mention that the online forums over at SkeletalCircus.com are really worth participating in if you're a fan of anything Dax Riggs has been involved with. It's a great online community.

@RainbowDissent: I think it would be cool if you held off on any of the current Fat Possum/deadboy releases and maybe stuck with boots or the Rotten Records released stuff, they're all dicks at Rotten anyways. :)
How about a decent rip or DVD-R of the Acid Bath Double Bootleg DVD?"
,RainbowDissent,2008-01-20T18:41Z,"sardy, I think you're right about current releases, I won't put new deadboy/Dax studio albums up for share. If This Is Hell... is out of print, so I'll upload that sometime soon. 

I might consider ripping and upping my Double Live Bootleg DVD too. Problem is, the network I'm on is a shared Uni network and I don't have any access to the router, so there's no way for me to set up port forwarding. I can just about seed an album or something, but 700MB would be a stretch. I'll definitely put it up when I'm home over Easter though, if somebody else hasn't by then. "
