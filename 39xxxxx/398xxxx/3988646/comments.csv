,Gloworm4658,2008-01-23T12:29Z,"just so u know, something seems 2 b wrong with my azureus because everytime I try to download this, it errors out n says ""I'm Sorry"" n ""Sorrow"" r missing pieces but they play fine.  This is preventing me from seeding but I always try n do my part."
,Veridgeus,2008-01-29T15:44Z,"Please Seed, stuck at 41% for ages now, thanks :)"
,Sikkwolf,2008-01-31T22:53Z,"Why the fuck did you upload them in low quality AAC? No offense partner, but there better ways to do this."

how do i convert them to mp3?

 its mysterius iTunes files to me...."
,Codesmith,2008-02-10T06:04Z,"When someone notices that the only other torrent is  stuck at 40%, downloads the album from iTunes then strips the DRM.  Well a thank you is in order.  Yelling at them for not buying the CD instead isn't appropriate."
,benjirman,2008-02-11T14:37Z,"I agree, thanks for uping this after paying for it, i have a few albums I purchased through iTunes that I need to make torrents for, maybe I will now that I'm thinking about it.  At any rate, thanks again for this torrent!"

,Mike_501,2008-11-24T00:32Z,"@sikkwolf
How about you stfu, this is free so dont bitch, and you should know that AAC is the exact same thing as mp3 (to an extent) so dont bitch and use iTunes, you fucker.   lol"
