Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone


Leave the nonmagical world behind and enroll in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft 
and Wizardry in Harry Potter 
and the Philosopher's Stone for the PC. Be Harry Potter, wizard-in-training, learning to master all things 
magical in a world filled with adventure, fun, and danger. Encounter breathtaking challenges and unforgettable 
characters from J.K. Rowling's worldwide bestseller.

Players take the role of Harry Potter as he enrolls in Hogwarts and embarks on a journey to unlock the 
secrets of his own magical abilities. Along the way, Harry will explore the halls of Hogwarts and its surrounding grounds, study to be a wizard, learn Quidditch, collect objects to solve puzzles, become skilled at spells and potions, discover secret passages and locations, and interact with memorable characters from J.K. Rowling's magical world.

The PC version features an array of stealth-based gameplay as well as traditional encounters 
as players guide Harry through the halls of Hogwarts,

Many of the adventures in the PC version are dynamic, leading to environments
that change over time,
such as moving stairs and relocating classrooms.
The PC version also features a fast, arcade-style Quidditch game to further
