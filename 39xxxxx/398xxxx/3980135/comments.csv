,kottbanan,2008-03-26T13:58Z,"Hallå! Efter att introt är klart så får jag bluescreen :o!! Jag har Intel Core2 Duo, 2 Gig ram och ""mobile Intel 965 Express Chipset Family"" grafikkort. Om någon vet andledning eller lösning, eller VAR man kan ta reda på vad som orsakar promblemet skulle jag bli väldigt tacksam =)! Är det kanske så att spelet inte stödjer mitt grafikkort? Är det någon med samma probelm?  

HellO! After the intro is finished i get bluescreen :O! I got Intel Core2 Duo, 2 gig ram and ""mobile Intel 965 Express Chipset Family"" graficcard. If anybody knows the reason or solution, or WHERE i can find the answer on how to fix the problem, i would be very grateful =)! Maybe the game cant run because of my graficcard? Does anybody else got the same problem????

,Lizzzy,2008-12-19T17:04Z,"Don't know if it's just me because I'm playing the game on my laptop, but the game goes very quickly. And then I mean the game play itself, the sound is in a normal speed, but the game is going so fast no sentences can complete. The speed of the game gets hard at the point where you have to redraw the spell. The time to draw it goes 2 x as quickly too! 
So is it my laptop or can I do something to slow the game down?"

Well I've tried the game on my dad's PC and there it did play at a normal speed, so it probably was just my laptop. I'll just have to play it at my dad's PC ;)"
,MuchoMalo,2008-12-21T16:53Z,"i played the gameboy version first, this is just like it but bigger and funner. the only problem i have is that the screen is calibrated off to the side. i dont use a computer monitor, i use my tv so calibrating manually sucks. using my vid card is annoying. anyone else have this and find a solution?

,Payo112,2009-05-25T14:05Z,"GUYS THE GAME DOES WORK

-Install the program 7-zip (you can find it on google)

- Open the Harry Potter file you downloaded here (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.7z) with the program 7-zip

- Then select and drag all the files that are in Harry Potter Philosopher's stone.7z to a folder you want....or to desktop or what ever location

- Then just open the folder ""System""(this folder is in Harry Potter Philosopher's stone 7.z) and click ""HP""

And thats it! Btw those are the new tricks if you want to play Video games from torrent. The trick by that is that you don't need to install the game, you can play it right away....My advice is to keep 7-zip if you will want to download another game later..."

,louist44,2011-02-27T04:04Z,"classic game :')

small files size with a quick download.
Runs perfectly!

Few cons - When you load it up it takes a good while before you see the splash screens for EA and WB.
When changing the graphic settings/resolution it takes an age to get back into the game.

apart from that the whole game is here, nothing missing!

Virus free
running on vista x32"

I even walk over the floating books or parchment or whatever it is and the game still does not save.

So, my question is HOW DO I MAKE THE GAME SAVE?"

,Langushi,2011-08-12T14:13Z,"Works perfectly for me! I tried it on Windows XP 32-bit and Windows 7 64-bit and it worked perfectly for both. 

[!] For people who have problems with starting the game:
- Go to the folder where you extracted the .7zip file (called ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" ofcourse)
- Click on the ""System"" folder
- Double click on the ""HP.exe"" file to start the game

[!] For people who have problems with the game speed, or anything else, first check the Settings of Harry Potter 1 at the menu!
