,redvigilante,2008-09-12T21:06Z,"Download the Combined Community Codec Pack (CCCP, lolz) and VLC Player.  Both are available free, LEGITIMATELY!  If something isn't covered with those, you map have to download DivX (yuck) for its codecs alone (.mkv's, aka matroskas, won't require that though).  Good luck!"

,kilerbootsman,2008-12-09T23:03Z,"Seriously, slowest torrent ever"
,Linchpin,2009-01-18T04:02Z,"When it comes to video of any kind, I use K-Lite Codec Pack which comes with Media Player Classic. I have yet to encounter a movie that those won't play. The latest version is always available on filehippo.com. VLC is great too, but I don't really like the interface."
