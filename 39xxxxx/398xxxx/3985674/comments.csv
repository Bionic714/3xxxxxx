,PinkFlamingo,2008-01-21T19:56Z,"The usual questions -
1. Is this a good and stable release?
2. Can you run Windows Update on this one, without it saying that you are running a pirated copy?"

2. YES"
,goodnicstken,2008-01-25T06:03Z,"I'm not sure if it was CS3 or the updates that reset activation. The OS was stuck in a ""Must Activate"" ""Already Activated"" loop. The following torrent fixed it:

It's just hard to find the drivers for all boards, like ethernet, sound card, printers, etc... every driver must be for 64 bits plataform.
And you will need specific 64 bits programs too, like Autocad 08 x64, etc...

But guys, i've ran the CRACK, but it's still says that i need to activate within 2 days... How do I do? If i run windows update, it updates my WGA too? I'm afraid of my crack doesn't work anymore..."
,ABuSD,2008-04-05T16:13Z,"WORKS FINE!!!
Im typing this using this OS right now!! I recently upgraded my hardware so we had all the 64bit drivers handy.

,whatseasytoremember,2008-07-21T13:25Z,"ATTENTION PEOPLE ASKING ABOUT THE CD KEY:

After you write the ISO file to a CD, right click your CD-ROM drive and click ""explore"", theres a folder in there that contains a READ ME file (it really shouldnt take you too long to guess what folder it is). Read the readme file, it will tell you what to do.

After you follow the instructions I suppose you might want to run and install the windows XP activation crack thats linked several times in the comments.
-------------
It works fine, though it does not automatically detect my drivers.  I havent done any searching on it yet but if anybody has some advice on how to set up the internet and the sound card let me know.  A program that detects all my hardware for me would be nice. Im actually doing a dual boot on this with linux and it automatically connected me to the internet, would be nice if someone told me how to get XP to do this."

1. YOU DO NOT NEED A CD KEY. Mount the .iso file (which is a CD saved to your computer) with your choice of a mounting program (Daemon Tools, Alcohol 120% to name a few). Search for the folder with what you need in there.

2. YOU CAN NOT RUN THIS FROM WINDOWS. Burn the disc image (.iso) to a disc. Leave it in your computer. Restart your computer. If you do not get to the screen where it is asking to INSTALL windows, ask someone how to change your BOOT SEQUENCE."

Wrong I've not yet seen a key of any type in any folder.   it would be helpful is someone who has found it would say how they did so exactly or post the key? for us all.  Also you can not just put the cd in and let it go it will not autorun and install unless you first make your E drive or Cd-rom/DVD-Rom drive your A drive.   I recommend a new clean hard drive.  you also will need 64 bit drivers for your motherboard.  chipset, lan, sound, sata, raid, video... etc,"

Select all the parts by clicking and rolling over them or by holding the ""Ctrl"" key and select them one at a time till they're all highlighted then right click and select ""extract files"" option from the drop down menu, if ""extract files"" isn't there then download Winrar and try again.

The md5 is for checking the cash sum, md5 is a algorithm used to calculate the total of a file, if the file is different by even a bit you will get a different number, by comparing your md5 with that of the original or working file you can tell if the file is corrupt and save you time installing it and one more CD :)

~1st Question is already in the description~

Q. What computers can run Windows XP Professional X64 Edition? 
A. Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is designed to work with 64-bit processors from AMD and Intel that support the x64 extensions to the x86 architecture. These include the Athlon 64, Athlon 64 FX, Mobile Athlon 64, Turion 64, and Opteron processors from AMD, and the Xeon with EM64T and Pentium 4 with EM64T from Intel. 

Q. Can I run Windows XP Professional X64 Edition on my Itanium Workstation? 
A. No. The Itanium processor is a 64-bit processor that has a different architecture than the x64 processors. A version of Windows XP for the Itanium processor is no longer available. Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition continues to support the Itanium processor. 

Q. Can I run Windows XP Professional X64 Edition on my Centrino laptop? 
A. No, the Pentium M series of processors used in Centrino laptops are not 64-bit processors and can not use the x64 Edition of Windows XP Professional. There are x64-compatible laptops currently shipping that are based on AMD processors.

Almost every computer shipped pre-installed with vista or 7 you will need to download and integrate correct drivers into the XP ISO....

I use nlite for this purpose

Finding the drivers can be tricky sometimes, check with the manufacturer for the computer if they dont distribute any drivers on their webpages you can go directly to the motherboard manufacturer.

Unfortunately not all computers can be installed with XP since no drivers exist..."

[T],grimreaper420,2010-06-23T00:49Z,"I can confirm this torrent as a WORKING copy of XP Pro x64.
Also, please don't complain if you can't get this to work like come on man, just extract it to ONE folder and it's there, burn it @ the slowest speeds with a CD-R(700MB) blank disc, and ur good to go! "
,GnashPreds,2010-07-15T05:00Z,"Unzipped rar files, burned ISO to disc, and started install. About half way through the install it tells me a Windows file is missing and the install cannot be completed. It doesn\'t list a file name. Any ideas?"
,mathias886,2010-09-23T21:01Z,"The Image Is Great However. The fuckin Crack Doesnt Work at all. It locked me out of my computer saying Activate Now to Continue Using Windows. I clicked Activate Now And The Windows Comes Up Saying ""Lets Activate Windows"" Then The Sentence Reads ""Windows Is already Activated Click Ok to Exit."" Clicked Ok, now im logged off and caught in a loop. Thanks again for a very unsucessful crack but a good image [2]

Aconteceu a mesma merda comigo, depois de algum tempo de funcionamento comeÃ§ou a aparecer mensagens para ativar, mas nÃ£o aparece a janela dde ativaÃ§Ã£o, sÃ³ uma como se eu ja estivesse ativado com a opÃ§Ã£o de clicar OK. Apenas isso!! Esse crack so pula o periodo de ativaÃ§Ã£o, ele nÃ£o ativa de fato.  "

Downloaded Fast - Check!
Bootable CD - Check!
Working key - Check!
Fully installed - ............

After asking for the key it continues to install for a few minutes and then prompts me to enter the CD-ROM Titled SP2 or something... What do i do now? I have tried mounting it to a second CdD and trying again with the same results! Please help anybody?"

,BullTweeter99999,2011-12-05T04:45Z,This is great. Thanks much. Installed without a hitch straight from the ISO on a VM on a Ubuntu 64 installation. The crack folder on the CD is a huge bonus. Trying a CD installation next as the primary Windows set-up. I followed your instructions exactly-and they worked. Thanks again.
