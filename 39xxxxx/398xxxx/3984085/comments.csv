,FlamingAnt,2008-01-19T06:27Z,"Ok I finally got it to start uploading, but Azureus won't let me seed faster then 27kbps? I change the settings to 300kbps then hit save, but it keeps going back to 27. I'm getting overwhelmed here, can someone help out?"
,FlamingAnt,2008-01-19T06:39Z,"I'm sorry about this, I'm going to temporarily use the more familiar but less secure uTorrent to start the seeding."
,FlamingAnt,2008-01-19T07:17Z,"Ok my last comment for now. I'm stuck at about 50kbps. Thats pretty good. I can't figure out how to limit upload slots in uTorrent so it's gonna be 1 seeder for a while. I'll be seeding just like this tonight and all of tomarrow. After that I will just do nights, but by then I'm sure there will be other seeders."
