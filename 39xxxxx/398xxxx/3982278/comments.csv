,CjTheCritic,2008-01-31T13:59Z,"Downloading right now its going good at 40kbs-70kbs I will update on everything if its fake if its not after, if it is real Thank you so much ZaRES for bringing these Cartoon heros back =]"
,CjTheCritic,2008-02-01T11:06Z,"Dont download they lied when they said its spoken in English its either Dutch or Spanish.

Big dissapointment =(
Good show though.

It Does not include Subtitles either =/

Not worth downloading unless you speak these languages."
,Pixxyy,2008-03-12T17:19Z,Do not download. They are not speaking english as ZaRES says. I am almost sure that it is Spanish.
,nkAlex,2008-04-20T11:06Z,"If that is really release from Multreactor.ru, there should be 2 audio tracks included:

Audio track #1: Russian
Audio track #2: English"
,A-SerpentGod,2008-05-15T18:56Z,"Indeed, 2 audio channels. However the tune at the beginning isn't included"
,nkAlex,2008-05-18T11:29Z,"What do you mean by ""the tune""?"

,TyMann58,2008-10-24T11:39Z,"download VLC media player, open the files in it, go to 'Audio' then 'Audio track' And select 'Track 2' works perfect for me.  Althought the quality isn't the best, but it's all I've found and I used to love this one growing up. Thanks"

That said thank you for the torrent!"
