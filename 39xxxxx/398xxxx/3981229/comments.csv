For the first time IN OUR LIVES we have the chance to vote for a president who tells us the truth. I don't care what the media says or doesn't say about him. I don't care what ""front-runner"" they are telling me is winning this week. 

I DO NOT have to vote for the lesser of two evils in 2008 - and I won't.
