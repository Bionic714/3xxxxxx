,wow93,2008-02-23T20:59Z,you neade a DVD xD
,MrShooter,2008-03-15T00:52Z,"Great job !!
I am trying to figure out how to take the unzipped files and turn it into a playable dvd. I have never seen the actual instructional video but am assuming it has selectable lessons that run at the same time as Photoshop CS3. The lessons have you doing things while you are in PSCS3. I have dvd burning programs but have no clue how to turn this into the correct playable DVD. Any help or suggestions are much appreciated"

Normally I would say: don't buy it, here I can only say: don't waste you time :)

I recommend the lynda.com tutorials by Deke McClelland."

the total training series for Ps are fucking stupid. both essential and advanced. Enhancing digital photograph is dumb either. 
So funny that they call it ""advance"" and the big fat guy is an expert. 
Of course u will benefit smt. The Gui and some trick, in a step by step and repeated way. 
So, sorry to the total training fan boy,  i would call this ""Total training Ps cs3 for the most patient morons in the world"""
