,Troy123,2008-05-04T07:57Z,I have finely downloaded this. Next time can you at least compress it so it does not take a mouth to get.
,thedamager,2008-05-11T15:40Z,"First, whoever says it's not 1080p is a moron and needs to read more before proving him/herself stupid. Period.

Second, torrent title says Star.Wars.Episodes.Complete.1080p.HDTV.x264-hV. HDTV means source is HDTV (no shit!). If the source was BluRay or HDDVD title would say BluRay or HDDVD respectively (so cryptic, isn't it?).

Third, my humble suggestion for a codec+player combination would be CCCP (combined comunity codec pack) + Media Player Classic (comes with CCCP). It takes tiniest bit of tinkering and then it plays every video file that you come across. Of course you can always use VLC player which has integrated codecs  but user interface is a bit crappy. You'll need roughly 3.0GHZ Pentium class single core CPU to decode this. Note that newer graphic cards (nVidia 7, 8, 9 series and Ati  1, 2, 3 series) support hardware acceleration of MPEG 4 AVC (which x264 is part of), so it will greatly offload your CPU.

And, yeah, before anyone asks, no, you can't burn it on DVD and watch it on your 640x480 CRT TV.

Hope this clarified some things... Cheers."

,karunaguzman,2008-05-23T01:13Z,"Episodes IV through VI have yet to be commercially released in any hd format, so what you're getting here is the three latest star wars films in hd. The others can only come from 1080p h264 Sky feed which is has then been converted to x264.
To those of you who think that an interlaced picture is the same as a progressive picture, please do yourself a favour and read some creditable litterature on the matter. There is a large difference between perceived difference and actual contained information of a picture. For a starter, you can read up on the matter here http://www.hdtvtest.co.uk/Article/Why-We-Love-1080p.php or here http://www.cinematography.net/Pages%20DW/1080i_or_780P.htm

In waiting times....

Could somebody, if they know, explain how this torrent technology works.  I understand it is 'pieces' that is being sent sround´. Correct?

The major thing I am wondering about is: Does the program like distribute these pieces in an ""optimized order"". For example, When I start download, could I be sent/given an piece from the END of a BIG FILE. In theory then, this could mean that if I would be stuck in, say 99%, I could be completed by someone at 0.5% just because he had the pieces I ""wanted"" to complete the file. So does the program function like this or, to spread the pieces in an random order somehow to get maximum distribution speeds, and to get the file to as much people as possible.

I´ve seen torrents that there is one seeder and like 200 leechers. Everybody is stuck at, say 23%. And the seeder is pumping out like 0,1Kbps to everyone, this takes then FOREVER TO COMPLETE.

It would be better somehow if he, the seeder in this case, would transmit only to a few, who when then complete, seeds to a few. This way it would be much quicker.

Hmm... I understand now that if what I said just right now, the first thing about ""automated distribution optimization"" with the pieces may not exist?

Anybody with more info on this?!?!"

,gr689,2008-10-20T08:00Z,"PLease Please Please.......

Here are the answers that you all have been waiting for....
These movies are VERY VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO PLAY because of how big they are. It would have been way better to download these movies seperate and not together. The buffering rate is too much for most very advanced systems. I usually don't download anything over 15gb, because the movie will stutter. 

Now if you use KM Player, its free, instead of VLC you may fix the problem. Check it out. 

Next....these movies have all come out in HD on HBO and Cinemax and that is where these are probably from and are from someones PVR. 

Next... No High Def movies have not always been out since the 60's and 70's but FILM HAS! Film doesn't have pixels and if you tried to count the pixels on 35mm or 70mm film it goes way way way past 1080p... Film movies could be used ,in the future when we have HDTV sets that go this high, to 3600p or beyond. That being said, only 3 of these movies was shot in film. So the newest ones PM, AOTC, and ROFTS, cannot ever go beyond 1080p because they are digital and the pixels are counted. 

I hope this little lesson has covered the problems and issues we've been experiencing. "

A little clarification.  A DVD video isn't just a name and neither is 1080p.
 'Most likely' It's because it's cropped.   Movie Ratios tend to be a bit more than 16X9.  
If you got a full 1080p vertically, how big would your television have to be to view the entire image?"

,thorofdenmark,2009-01-22T07:28Z,Excellent quality. Strangely better than most bluray-1080p-rips(!!!) If you wanna show of you new Full HD TV this is what you want even if you?re not a fan! Well worth the week of download!
,540p,2009-01-23T01:17Z,Why are the three prequels only in stereo? I would rip the 5.1 audio from my DVD copies and combine it with this HD video track but this is a 25 fps version and my DVDs are the NTSC version. Any thoughts on how I would get 5.1 for episodes 1-3?
,540p,2009-01-30T03:31Z,"I used avisynth to slow down the video tracks to the original 23.976 fps (aka 24000/1001 fps), encode at level 4.1 and lower the bitrate to make it fit a DVD, and add in the letterbox bars, then ripped the higher quality audio tracks from the DVDs. After properly synchronizing the two tracks I created AVCHD DVDs that are playable on a PS3.

Basically the lesson is don't upload HD movies at 25 fps with low quality audio because it takes more than ten times as long to restore it to what it should be."
,synnbad,2009-02-05T18:01Z,48 gigabytes for 6 movies? Blu-ray is smaller than that and blu-ray is superior to HD.. 
,540p,2009-02-07T02:24Z,"synnbad, a Blu-ray Disc can hold 50 GB if it is a dual-layer disc, and usually the size of a movie on BD is anywhere from 15 to 45 GB. Multiply that by six and you have a lot more than 48 GiB. This version appears to be designed in order to fit one movie per dual-layer DVD."
,skullcrusher,2009-02-15T18:46Z,seeed!!! for f**** sake!!!! please !!!!
,Visor4,2009-02-16T05:51Z,"Yes, it's true, these versions are in 25fps, with everything sped up 4%, which to any North American die-hard fan is like listening to nails scratching on a chalkboard, LOL.   It's obvious these were captured from Europe satellite, and unfortunately Episodes II & III were only broadcast with 2.0 sound.

Anyway, some of you have been asking how to convert them back to 23.976, and I see that at least one poster (540p) mentioned he used AviSynth.  However, since AVISynth is quite complicated compared to most GUI apps out there, I recommend using TSMuxer to extract the video as well as change the frame rate to ""24000/1001"".  You can also use TSMuxer to extract the audio, but unfortunately, TSMuxer is having a problem recognizing the 2-ch audio on Eps II & III.  For this, I extracted the audio using MKV Extractor.  I then used BeSweet to slow all the audio tracks down to 23.976.  (Alternately, you could replace it with the DVD audio, for true 5.1 on the problematic episodes and louder volume all around).  Finally, I used MKVMerge to put them back together in a new .mkv file.  Granted, this does not create an AVCHD disc, but that requires knowledge of AVISynth and a re-encode of all the films in order to add letterbox bars so that you don't get a distorted picture or blue bars when watching on your Blu-Ray player.  I'll live with playing it through my laptop to my HDTV until the true Blu-ray Discs start coming out (rumoured to begin in 2010, according to TheDigtalBits.com).

Visor"
,540p,2009-02-21T22:59Z,"Visor, your method looks like it would work too, but wouldn't slowing down the audio result in the pitch being incorrect? (unless you use pitch correction) I decided to avoid all of those problems and just rip the DVD's audio tracks instead, which also have a higher bitrate. (448 kb/s on the DVD instead of 384 kb/s from this torrent) Also, for those who may decide to use my method, I used Premiere Pro to count the number of frames that were cut out of this version (mostly the ""blank"" frames before the 20th Century Fox logo) and then used dimensional analysis to convert the frames of delay to seconds, aka multiply the number of frames that you count by (1 second/(24000/1001 frames)) Obviously you need to convert the video track to the correct framerate first. I then used ""Delaycut"" to shorten the AC-3 audio track."
,pc39707,2009-02-23T21:58Z,"Ok. Just finished comparing  this 1080p Return of the Jedi with the DVD-version on my 1080p Sony projector (professionally calibrated). The colors and resolution are slightly better on the 1080-version, but the difference is not that big. I'm still hoping for a proper BD release soon."
,suck_this,2009-03-26T12:25Z,"Wow, im using utorrent for the first time and I think bitcomet is better. Im scanning the peer list and some guy in sweeden is getting 650 kbps...wtf! another one in germany I think. Anyway when I turn my upload speed up to 40 kbps max, my download rate goes down to 20 kbps. When I turn it down to 30 kbps it goes up to 40-50 kbps.

,uribelarreaj,2009-10-22T21:18Z,"about the resolution, it will never be 1920x1080 because the movie was not shot that way:

For Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith the more advanced Sony HDC-F950 was used, with higher resolution and better color reproduction than its predecessor. The film was cropped to a 2.35:1 aspect ratio from its native 16:9 frame. As a result only 817 of the 1080 vertical pixels were actually used;

,donmeyer,2009-11-21T04:32Z,"I downloaded the samples and they are AWESOME, they really are 1920*816, but this is not a problem, because it they were 1080 the image would be stretched out and all the actors would look anorexic, or it would crop the image from the sides. It is NOT upsampled from DVDs, trust me on this they are as sharp as they get.

Yes, I know Episode 2 was filmed in 1280*560 but Lowry Images did the upsampling to IMAX, they had specialized software and wrote code to really dig into the image and find detail.

Isn't there anyone who knows how to remux, demux, whatever... split... WHATEVER, but a way to slowdown the video framerate?

Audio isn't an issue because you can slow it down any way you like on an audio editor. And then merge both audio and video streams later."

My one issue with this torrent is that all 6 films have been encoded at 25 frames per second (European standard) whereas the original frame rate of all these films are 24 frames per second.

It's OK though, I was able to extract the video, audio and subtitle tracks and convert them to the original theatrical frame rate and I recommend everyone else do the same (if you know how) so that you can watch each film as it was intended to be viewed unless you are planning on watching these films on a PAL display.

I use the following software to convert PAL (25fps) -> FILM (24fps):

- MKVExtract
- eac3to
- Subtitle Edit 2.93
- MKVMerge
- Audicity 1.3 (Beta) * used only if eac3to is not converting properly
- FFMmpeg for Audicity * plugin for Audicity to enable .ac3 importing

Steps:

1) Create a folder where you will be working with your demuxed streams.  I call mine ""starwars"" and I create it in my root directory (c:\starwars).

2) Extract anyone of the Star Wars .mkv files you've downloaded using MKVExtract to the folder you've created.  Uncheck ""Chapters"" when extracting but leave everything else checked.  This will create 3 files that you'll be working with: a .srt (subtitles), an .ac3 (audio) and a .h264 (video).

3) Extract/place eac3to into the folder you created.  Use eac3to to convert the .ac3 file from PAL -> FILM by opening up a command prompt and typing ""eac3to .ac3 .ac3 -slowdown"" (example: eac3to starwars.ac3 starwars_24.ac3 -slowdown).  This will take about 10-15min to complete.

4) Use Subtitle Edit 2.93 to convert the .srt file from PAL -> FILM by clicking on ""Tools -> Change frame rate..."".  In the first textbox type ""25"" and in the second textbox type ""23.976"" and click OK.  Save your converted subtitles (I save them as a new file (example: starwars_24.srt) just in case something goes wrong).

5) Run MKVMerge and add the .h264 file.  When you do add it, you'll get a pop up dialogue box - just click OK.  In the ""format specific options"" tab set the ""FPS:"" textbox to ""24000/1001"".  Now add your converted .ac3 and .srt files.  For each of the 3 files you've added, you can play around with with the first 4 settings in the ""General track options"" but it shouldn't be necessary.  Click ""Start muxing"" to create your converted .mkv file and you're done."
