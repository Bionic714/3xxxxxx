,karin1978,2008-06-21T22:34Z,"Hi there,

I desperately need help from anyone who could do me a bigggg..gggg favor.
I have downloaded an ""ABBYY FineReader 9.0 Pros"" from quite a few people here in TPB, they are working great. 
However, since I deadly need to have the Thai language supported, which all of the downloads from here couldn't avail my need. 

I do a further research on the ABBYY website itself, and found that i need to use the updated version to get Thai language supported. 
(Reference : http://www.abbyy.com/press/press_releases.asp?param=144054)
I then started to download the installation file from ABBYY website, its size is 243 MB. 
(Reference downloaded site : http://finereader.abbyy.com/?param=137544)

BUT after downloading and installing the software, I got a BIG problem about product activation. I try to play around with merging some files from the TPB version with 

the downloaded Thai support version, never success. 

Anyone could help me out of this please? Would be truly appreciated for your help and mercy.

If anyone would be able to help me, please write me kms2547(at)h0tmail(dot)com.

Best regards,

Karin"
