,QFA380,2008-01-19T08:04Z,"I have the SR22, you need to pull up a gauge that opens and closes all those things. The short-cut should be Shift-8 or -9. Then click on the things and your various things should close."
,flightsimFS9,2008-01-19T10:28Z,"Thanks QFA380, it works, the  short-cut is shift-9"
