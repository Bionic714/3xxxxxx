[Release Notes]
Finally the real deal right here... While every noob over the weekend was
leeching the horrible iTunes reencode from their favorite torrents, we were
just awaiting the wonderful CD, with proper cuesheets :)


Amsterdam 08 follows in the footsteps of Miami 05 and Ibiza 06, and
Markus Schulz couldn't be happier about its origins - Amsterdam is his
spiritual home thanks to the overwhelming passion of the people resident
there. "I always choose cities that are dear to me for my annual mix
compilation" says Markus. "I just love Amsterdam, I feel a real
connection there - my friends there are like my family. The people of
Holland were one of the first to embrace and accept me and my sound, so
it was the natural choice to do the 08 mix there."

Markus' brand of dark, melodic trance is in demand the world over; his
weekly Global DJ Broadcast radio show is now syndicated to over 30
stations worldwide, his shows have taken in everywhere from Australia to
Russia, China to Trinidad, and many other destinations along the way, and
2008 is set to bring more dates in Australia, as well as Asia and South
America. Amsterdam 08 is a must-have album for dance fans everywhere, and
comprises Markus' top tracks from 2007 and hot tips for 2008. "I really
enjoy putting the compilation CDs together," says Markus, "they're always
a total labour of love and are in my mind all the time. All year I'll
hold back tracks that are just gems for the mix; I'll play them out here
and there over the summer but I'll save them for the CD. Amsterdam 08
opens a little differently - CD1 starts quite slow by trance standards:
124 bpm, so it sets the mood, similar to when I'm playing extended sets.
The atmosphere builds up so that when you get to CD2 it's full on,
middle-of-a-set tempotrance."

Markus, who also runs his own Coldharbour label, is often in Amsterdam
for club dates and regularly plays for Armada Music's events and
festivals. "I really feel part of this city, it's so special for me" he
says. "This CD is a thank you to everyone there who has supported me over
the years, and I hope it becomes a special selection of tunes to everyone
who hears it."
