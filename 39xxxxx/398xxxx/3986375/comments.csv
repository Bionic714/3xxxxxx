,MartyG,2008-01-25T19:25Z,"Well worth watching.
As an american I'm ahamed of my fellow citizens.
The tip to get subtitles worked."
,Cpt.Oats,2008-01-30T13:25Z,"Good quality and the subs work fine.  But does anyone have the regular English rip or know where to find it?  The problem with the English subs is that they are on screen even during the English scenes.    Good movie, but there has to be a regular Eng rip out there with subs only on the non-English scenes."
,al1and,2008-02-01T16:46Z,"thanks for the info, BigPapa..I tried what u suggested but still the subs don't show.  I have had other movies with subs so don't get why it doesn't work here. Will keep  my eyes peeled for another good source, I have been just using FXG since it's consistently good video and audio...thanks again for the tip."
,hazel76,2008-02-02T14:34Z,Very good movie!! thanks for the upload.. and thanks to operil1 and BIG PAPA-G for the subtitle.. 
,Caribbeancoladas,2008-02-03T14:38Z,"BIGPAPPA G!!! THXS Now the subs are working by replacing the name of the file. Thxs again. Caribbeangreetings,"

,Paynestrike,2008-02-21T18:08Z,Another Great Quality Release from FXG team very impressed 
,mabey,2008-02-23T14:04Z,great upload thx.... what dvd converter/burner does everyone use that gives you the option to add subs?
,hdog007,2008-02-25T03:12Z,MartyG:  That's some ignorant shit to say.  You should be ashamed of the religious extremists who kill innocents (including their own).  Don't be ashamed of your country for trying to stop this type of behavior.
,grunkle,2008-02-25T11:29Z,"Very nice - Kudos!
"
,GIMMETVDVD,2008-03-04T06:18Z,these subs that fxg gave out dont work. ive tried with many different video players and nothing.this movie is useless to watch without the subs cause close to half the movie is in egyptian. FXG is usually better then this. I MISS AXXO
,dogssrgtsmokey,2008-03-06T18:41Z,"I am not new to DL'ing, but I am new to adding subs.  I have read the above comments and have renamed the srt. file, yet now the movie will not play at all.  It plays fine (w/o subs) when the file is not the same name.  Any suggestions?  Should I try a different player?"
,Furnuts,2008-03-12T03:09Z,"if the subs dont work for you try renaming them to the same name i.e. Rendition.AVI and Rendition.SRT this should solve your problem. also, VLC media player handles it very well, so if you dont have it, get it! "
,jh3141,2008-03-14T01:10Z,"Nice quality video.  But, the scenes that aren't in English don't have subs, unless I play the subtitle file which puts subs on *all* scenes.

Does anyone know where I can get a subtitle file only for the non-English scenes?"

,Nvdia_Kevin,2008-08-07T17:07Z,"Nice, good quality."
,swabthedeckmatey,2009-08-10T11:08Z,"@Franny96
The question has also been _answered_ a million times: get VLC.  There's a Mac version.  Quicktime plays very few formats and there aren't nearly as many codecs for it as there are for WMP."
,tieranosaur,2009-09-11T18:17Z,"really good upload, i watched in VLC and the subtitles were great.  movie is kinda slow, but the ending is alright."

,Stoposto,2012-07-27T09:18Z,"@hdog007: Is MartyG being ignorant or are you? It took 3000 people to be killed 9/11 for you to go to war, Now think, Afghanistan lost so much more than that when going to war vs Russia with the support of US, but US then stopped supporting them, causing Russia to retaliate and they did 9/11 times 100. 

Same story with Iraq, Saddam was a dictator put on the power by the US and we didn't stop him when he was making a genocide on the Kurdish people. So on with Lybia and Syria.

Just think, each time you bomb or kill a so called Terrorist or just an innocent, Wont that make that persons friends and family just that much more likely to support the ""Terror organisations"" to retaliate?

People in Iraq shooting at US troops are likely people who have lost loved ones, rather than being supporters of Saddam or Terrorism. 

PS: US have killed over 3 million Afghanistanis/Iraqis /Palestinians people. We all know not all of them held a weapon in their hands, you cant control a bomb to drob on a building and only kill the ""bad-guys"" 

Just a history lesson for you hdog007. Think before you speak, and Read before you think.

Btw Great Rip/Movie A9/V9"
