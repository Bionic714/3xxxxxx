,markerb,2009-01-20T16:32Z,"madmax999: This is so easy...  John Banner was in this movie, and is well known for playing the Nazi Sgt. Schultz in TV's ""Hogan's Heroes"" from '65-'71.  His catch phrase was ""I know nothing...  Nothing!"" upon seeing the Allied prisoners doing something they shouldn't.

With his Austrian accent and looks, he ended-up playing Nazi villains in many war movies before he landed a part in ""Hogan's Heroes.""

Most ironic was that Banner was Jewish and was a refugee from his Austrian homeland.   Many of his family members were put in concentration camps and murdered by the Nazis.  He defended his ""cuddly Nazi"" character once by saying, ""I see Schultz as the representative of some kind of goodness in every generation."""
