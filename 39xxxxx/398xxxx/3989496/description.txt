JACKASS VOL. 1

120 MINS.

UNRATED



Here at long last is the mysteriously missing and all but forgotten volume 1 of the Jackass DVD series. Where it went, nobody knows, but this disc portrays the humble televised beginnings of Jackass: Johnny Knoxville?s stupefying performace in the "Poo Cocktail," Bam Margera?s early parental assaults on Phil and April, Preston Lacy and Wee-Man when they were slightly slimmer "Oddly Shaped Men," the loveable little goldfish that went there and back again into the middle earth of Steve-O?s digestive system, and all the other silly crap that spawned two more season?s worth of bad ideas. Oddly enough, it all started out as a joke but then went on to become one of MTV?s most popular shows ever. The fact that the joke is still playing out after all these years is, quite possibly, the greatest Jackass stunt of all-time. Not bad for a bunch of grown men that take childish delight in running around in their underpants.
