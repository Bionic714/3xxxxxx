,namelessted,2008-01-21T23:18Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3989197

I am seeding the first music collection pack for Audiosurf, i hope you enjoy"
,Morkedcram,2008-01-23T12:28Z,"Thank you very much for this torrent. Do you know if/how fiddler can remember the Autoresponder settings?

I beat you with ""The Fucking Contra Band - Player Select through Hangar"" :)"
,namelessted,2008-01-31T03:02Z,unfortunately i am pretty sure there isn't anyway to save the fiddler settings. It is a bit tedious but it is better than not playing
,ludvik0,2008-02-12T13:42Z,"they sayd they dont have internet connection, why?"
,jygi-.-,2008-02-12T15:26Z,"when i run the game, it gives me ""the beta version has expired, or you dont have a internet connection. an active internet connection is required only during beta testing."" could someone help?"
,bimania,2008-02-12T23:15Z,"Thank you =) Funny game, I like it..."
,bob01uk,2008-02-13T12:01Z,"for the life of me i cant get this damm game working with tha cracks.
If i use the crack exe i get the demo is expired and i need to update, it then if i dont use the crack, the game loads but it wont allow me to  play any of my songs i have in my collection

Im using vista ultimate"
,rettvestcrew,2008-02-13T17:05Z,"thanks alot! the seed on this is xtreme! i downloaded this in less than five minutes:D
I havnt tested it yet, but i have Vista Ultimate, im not that sure if it works. but i really hope so:P"
,namelessted,2008-02-13T19:28Z,I am using Windows Vista Ultimate as well. If you follow the instructions it will work. you have to have fiddler running and then you can run audiosurf. If you read teh instructions it is pretty self explanatory. Do NOT update teh game when it asks you to.
,Aonshix,2008-02-13T22:28Z,"Ack, whenever i run it with fiddler open it gives me a 'error opening. saved to logbook (audiosurf log here)'

Anyone else get that then work out what they did wrong? I've clean installed + followed the instructions several times, so I must be doing something wrong."
,whosniffedme,2008-02-16T06:14Z,It's saying i don't have an active connection either. Someone please help me resolve this problem i followed the instructions exactly.
,Napoje,2008-02-17T18:27Z,"I know fiddler is needed to run game, and it works. But what does fiddler actually do? Why does it need internetconnection?"
,tr_a2,2008-02-17T21:37Z,"doesnt work.
""This Beta Version has expired, or you don't have an active internet connection."" Update is not possible, too.
followed all the instructions."
,elitefgt,2008-02-18T14:56Z,"Works perfectly fine, the fiddler program is only needed to trick the BETA into thinking that the BETA is still active. Just read the instructions.txt and follow them correctly, and you'll have a blast. It says you need to reinstall after the 3 songs, I just restart the game and it still works fine. Steam is not required, nor is a Steam account."
,Mr_Wendle,2008-02-19T03:26Z,"This is a good original game. It was developed not by a corporation but by a single independent developer. He has priced it at a reasonable $10 US.

If you support independent game developers, you can try the free demo or buy the game at http://www.audio-surf.com/ The $10 investment allows you to enjoy all aspects of this innovative game. "
,elitefgt,2008-02-19T13:00Z,Buying the game doesn't offer anything extra. Also buying through Steam is stupid = http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/image.php?9bd60f2033.png
,AsianBorat,2008-02-23T07:04Z,"ok, now, obviously, I am going to buy this game, so that I can receive the full experience and to honor the f*cking genius of a game creator Dylan Fitterer.
However, that's not happening in quite a while (gotta wait till my birthday, when my parents will be willing to buy it for me), so for now, I have settled with the Beta crack, to serve as a replacement before I buy the whole game (even though the cracked beta provides virtually anything anyways, but dude, even piraters like me have a good sense of honor. BUY Audiosurf plz).
After I got the beta, I was using the Fiddler program (came with crack) to bypass the whole ""beta has ended"" thing, and continue playing. (does this by blocking certain URL or something)
However, I noticed that this also blocks my ability to post my score on the servers, and while I wait for my time to buy the game, I want to at least be able to rank up to other people! But anyways, is there a way to make it so that Fiddler doesn't block the ability to post score, but still allow you to play the beta?"
,dylarny,2008-02-26T09:00Z,wats the product code/ key thing???
,Genewitch,2008-03-07T14:32Z,no longer works as of today (loginauth4.php does not exist on this server or some such) ... think they broke this workaround with a patch.
,Valve4Life,2008-03-08T18:06Z,I just took a shit and my ass hurts the torrent works
,namelessted,2008-03-26T17:45Z,"hey this torrent is out of date now peoples

the game has been released either buy it or find a new torrent that has the full release and not just the beta version"
,PawnSacrifice,2008-08-08T06:29Z,Works perfectly. Just follow instructions. Will be buying this on pay day. 
,Saabatron,2009-02-11T02:47Z,"The game works noobs!, u have to be running fiddler2 which is included it the download, just run the instructions.txt, follow the instructions before instalation and its so simple! But you may actually have to make a login account when your playing though..."
,Triggerhand,2009-03-28T06:04Z,Wow i've been looking for this forever! thanks so much so so so so much! Always love.
,amanteous,2009-06-20T20:13Z,maybie the game finds the song from 
,amanteous,2009-06-20T20:14Z,from the internet or you click to play online the game .sorry for the comment before.my mistake
,mangou,2011-03-18T01:21Z,"If you don't want to reinstall / restart the game after 3 songs, you can do this to play unlimited :

1. Open with a hex editor the file SavedConstants.cgr located in the AudioSurf\engine\Support directory.

2. Go to offset A290. Replace the byte value with FF 
3. Go to offset A291. Replace the byte value with FF"
,mangou,2011-03-18T19:51Z,for the trick in my previous comment in order to work you should have launched and exited audiosurf 1 time after installing
,roope242,2012-03-27T12:42Z,Worx good but you could seed :)
