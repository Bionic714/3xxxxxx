LEAP OF FAITH - 1992

  This is not a Comedy, and yet it is probably one of Steve Martin's best films. Don't look for the 'wild and crazy guy' you've come to expect.

  LEAP OF FAITH stars Steve Martin as Jonas Nightengale, a fraudulent faith healer who makes a living visiting small towns and giving hope in the form of prayer. Aided by his no nonsense manager, Jane (Debra Winger), Jonas sets up his tent in a small suburb of Kansas where he soon learns that their hidden mikes, cameras and computers can?t fool the neighborhood sheriff (Liam Neeson). But, when Jonas is touched by a local waitress (Lolita Davidovich) and her disabled son Boyd (Lukas Haas), he learns something new about truth and what real miracles are made of.
