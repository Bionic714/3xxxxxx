Having toured on a consistent basis since the release of their 1988 debut, Out of the Silent Planet, you'd think that King's X would have issued a live set some time ago. But for whatever reason, the Texas trio didn't get around to unleashing a live set until the 2004 double-disc Live All Over the Place. Instead of issuing a complete show from one of their recent tours (they remain quite a force to be reckoned with live, by the way), the chaps have opted to assemble a compilation of performances from various tours. While this technique has often resulted in flat albums for bands in the past, it actually works out well here, as it's constructed similarly to the set list utilized during the group's tour in support of Black Like Sunday. For the most part, it can be split into three sections -- starting off "electric," going into an acoustic set in the middle, and then wrapping things up with a return to amplification. Most of the expected King's X classics are included here -- "Dogman," "Over My Head" (included as both electric and acoustic versions), "Summerland," and the jamfest "Moan Jam." But it's the underrated album cuts that put this set over the top, especially a gorgeous reading of "The Difference," "Believe," "Talk to You," and another jam-heavy track, "Visions." Also, kudos to King's X for not overdubbing this set to death -- especially with the majority of rock bands going Pro Tools crazy during the early 21st century. [allmusic.com]
