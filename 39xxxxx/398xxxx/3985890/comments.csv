,bmwz4302,2008-06-13T09:08Z,"For the first 50% or so, this torrent was anywhere from 30K-50K, then when I hit 50 or 60%, it jumped to 200-600K/s and finished in about an hour and ten minutes.... I am on Mac OS X and I am using ""Transmission"" to download my torrents.  So far, all torrents have been faster on my mac than on my pc.  I believe that when a Mac port is open, things go faster than a windows open port.  Who knows."
