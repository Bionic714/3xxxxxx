,yanqui9,2008-06-21T23:05Z,"Sure this isn't an upgrade?  Did all the magic pixie dances mentioned in past comments and could not get it to install, missing files.   Are you sure this is not an upgrade package?  Anyone get this to install properly and operate from scratch (no previous Visual Basic installs)?"
,yanqui9,2008-06-21T23:27Z,"Ok, I got it to install, here's how...

I ran the ""acmboot.exe"" instead of the ""setup.exe.""

Installed like a charm... am I an idiot for not getting the right exe or brilliant for continuing to fiddle until I got it to work?  I think I'm both.  Thanks for the upload, vampwolf!"
,gvteja,2008-07-04T15:46Z,"i am getting insufficient memory.
can anyone please help me out?"
,BlackbeardTheLordOfWeb,2008-07-11T17:07Z,"Err i tried both acmboot.exe and setup.exe and it doesnt seem to be working for me, cause the setup just gets stuck at:""Setup is searching for instaled components"" and then it stops responding and i can only quit it.ANY HELP PLEEEEEEEAAASSSEEE!!!!!!!"
,Deth2U,2008-07-16T01:45Z,good job on this one man :). i got really fast speeds on this about 360+ kb :D. good job again :P
,Cheroku,2008-08-09T20:24Z,"You have to run the ACMBOOT first and put in the key that is in the visual_basic_6.txt NotePad file. and then run the SETUP.exe setup and put the same key in, no matter if you receive the, ""No setup..."" ect, error, in the ACMBOOT. I suggest you do a custom setup whether you alter anything or not. I also suggest not to ""Register Now"" your product.

I got it working perfectly first time by doing this."

On clicking SETUP it throws up the error message - Error accessing INI file in location  - LOCAL SETTINGS/TEMP/IXP008.tmp/setupwiz.ini

Please can anybody help me "
,clipandgo,2009-12-03T03:49Z,MSDN library doesn't install with the setup.You need to run the custom install to install but you need a disk for it.
,mishhh,2010-05-04T14:32Z,Create a folder like d:\vb6 or e:\vb6. Extract files in this directory. Install from this directory. It has to do something with path. It worked for me.
