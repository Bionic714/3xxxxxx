,g69mac,2008-01-21T06:49Z,quality is piss poor
,tamp,2008-01-22T15:29Z,Strange that it is bad quality! I used CLONEDVD so nothing is shrinked or stripped. It is cloned from a retail DVD. Sorry to you all!! :-(
,tamp,2008-01-22T16:06Z,I will try and upload one with GREAT quality tonight!? Check in later and see if i got it right!?
,tamp,2008-01-22T18:08Z,"Sorry! I burned theese files and they get the same ""poor"" quality as the retail DVD they are cloned from so I can not put up a better one. Sorry again but i hope you can see it anyway. Please let me know some input and thoughts. "

""quality is piss poor""

Is this due to a massive compression from a DVD9 to DVD5 tamp?

You have the original. If so. Concider cutting out all the extras and the italian, german and deutch languagefiles. If they cant read... well... :)

This should dramaticly improve the quality (picture)"
,tamp,2008-02-15T16:20Z,"Hi webspyder. I jused CLONEDVD on this one that gave the poor quality but iÂ´m gone juse
