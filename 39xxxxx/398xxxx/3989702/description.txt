Norton AntiVirus_10.0ESD

*I know you're probably wondering why would you should bother using this, right? You've already got a Mac and have probably never had virus issue! We'll, at least that is true for me... but I like this because you can configure this app to scan anything and everything that is wants to communicate with your computer.

examples:
Scan DVDs, CDs, flash/USB drives, external hard drives, et al!

**Keep the .dmg file in a safe place. If you reinstall in one year after it expires, you will get another year for free!

ENJOY
