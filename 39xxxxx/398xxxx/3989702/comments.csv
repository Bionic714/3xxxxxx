thanks anyway."
,captcornflakes,2008-01-22T11:01Z,"aox1, why do you use a 1 as both an i and an l?

A bit silly, don't you think? Oh, you probably don't think, hence the repost of already available software...."
,aox1,2008-01-24T09:37Z,"you people are so stupid. here is why:

1. if the file is already available on this site & others then why do you care what i do? i certainly couldnt care less about your torrents!

2.  when i put these files up i had no interest in look for previously uploaded versions of the same apps. all i know is that i had them and people wanted then... so i chose to start uploading torrents myself. surely you can understand that! if not, wow!!!

3. people who dont really understand computers (like older family members) dont give a shit how many copies of the same apps are made available. all they care about is getting something from someone they know... so if my torrents bother you then just go away and stop commenting.

4. not everyone has your point of view. just because YOU know about something doesnt mean that everyone else knows too. ive seen many copies of apps/files that range from crap to goods. all i make available are genuine copies... so why complain about that. if anything, you need to go bother people who upload bullshit.

5. how the hell are people supposed to get used to creating their own torrents without accidentally releasing something that you or someone else has already provided. if you look closely youd notice that my torrents (which have so obviously bothered you) were the first i ever created... under this handle or any other!

6. the reason im not burning to cd and sending in the mail is because the point of torrents (as i see it) is to eliminate the need for physical media. oh and its free... not to mention im not going to burn a new cd everytime someone asks me for something. 

7. get a life and leave me alone.

in short, the internet is free and available for everyone. my goal in life has nothing to do with pleasing you and/or your little socially crippled brain. if this is a problem for you, then deal with it!

If you want a free antivirus use ClamXav."
,macwel99,2008-01-28T01:36Z,Its funny to download anti virus software as torrent... and its funny to install any anti virus software on a mac system.
