IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT,.. AND I FEEL FINE.
season 1 (episodes 13-18)

Indy-VLOG created by Franklin Lopez of subMedia.. (and 'hosted' 
by the 571MUL47OR!) - this first season ran throughout 
2007 and provides for a most entertaining AND radical 
'year-in-review'

new episodes from season 2!  
 2.) check out other projects in the subMedia catalog. (some 
brilliant stuff there!)  
 3.) to purchase other activist oriented products from the 
website (and thereby help to support subMedia projects!)

derrick jensen's 'endgame'!))
