Synopsis

After serving time in prison for taking the fall for a group of his friends, Leo Handler (Mark Wahlberg) just wants to get his life back on track. So he goes to the one place he thinks will be safe -home. There he takes a new job with his highly connected and influential Uncle Frank (James Caan), and is reunited with his longtime friend, Willie Guitierrez (Joaquin Phoenix) and Willies girlfriend Erica (Charlize Theron). But in the vast New York City subway yards, where his uncle now pulls the strings, safe is not how they do business. Unwittingly, hes drawn into a world of sabotage, high stakes payoffs and even murder. And the secret he discovers will make him the target of the most ruthless family in the city -his own. Now, in the name of justice, hell have to do everything in his power to take them down.
