,babis200sx,2008-02-02T08:29Z,"Thank you very much!
One question: Because it's the first time I download FLAC audio files, how do I hear them? Do I need a special codec or something?"

,E-gel,2008-09-28T22:00Z,"Quite, could you please post the settings used for the encoding. There's another version of this album around and I'm asking myself why it is so much smaller than yours. Which ripper did you use? 
Thanx."
,E-gel,2008-09-28T22:06Z,OK it's not that much smaller but it still would be great to know.
,Bleach34,2009-08-15T19:33Z,"Is all of the songs in one file? That sucks, i just wanted one song...But good to add to my music collection.

Anyways, thanks for the upload!"
,Bleach34,2009-08-22T14:02Z,"Is there any way to select different tracks? How do I use the image file?? I tried opening it with Nero, but it says it couldn't open a file..."
