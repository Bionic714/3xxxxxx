STIR CRAZY - 1980

  Sidney Poitier directed this 1980 comedy. Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor play Skip Donahue and Harry Munro, two NYC losers who figure their only chance at a big break is to escape NYC and head for LA. They make it as far as Glenboro, a hicksville backwater desert town, where they are promptly framed for bank robbery. Their lawyer is utterly useless and they are in jail before they know it, literally. Skip only realizes the seriousness of the situation as they are being shown into their cell. But when Skip shows he has undiscovered talents as a rodeo champ the crooked Warden forces him to compete in the annual rodeo competition, giving Skip, Harry and some others a chance to escape. Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor made a great comedy team, and this may be their best movie.
