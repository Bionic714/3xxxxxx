  Five young New Yorkers throw their friend a going-away 
  party the night that a monster the size of a skyscraper 
  descends upon the city. Told from the point of view of 
  their video camera, the film is a document of their 
  attempt to survive the most surreal, horrifying event 
  of their lives.

A CAM version I downloaded via the Usenet (alt.binaries.boneless).  Not the best looking CAM I\\\\\\\'ve ever seen in my life but hey, haven\\\\\\\'t found another copy anywhere else.  I\\\\\\\'d say Video is a 4, audio the same.  Watchable if you don\\\\\\\'t have time to go see it in the theater.

Not a fake like others.  If you check my Pirate Bay page, I haven\\\\\\\'t uploaded much but what I have uploaded was real films.  Been looking for Cloverfield for some time now and nothing but fakes.  Saw this copy on NewsLeech and it had PARs so I thought it might be worth the trouble and it was.  No passwords.  I\\\\\\\'m just uploading the film as an AVI.
