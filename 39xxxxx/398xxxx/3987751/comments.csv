,DivorcedWithChildren,2008-01-21T08:08Z,"I also uploaded a very small torrent containing the NZB files you can import into your newsreader to get this CAM version yourself.  It comes with PARs for error correction.  You can download a single RAR file and use WinRAR to see if it requires a password.  I find the USENET a bit faster than torrents most of the time.  Just click on my name above to see the NZB file download.  By the way, did I get hit after I uploaded this torrent:  Hurricane Electric & RapidSwitch tried to eat up all my upload bandwidth but I cut them off at my router.  Thank God for PeerGuardian."
,jerstud56,2008-01-21T08:29Z,same here man they were trying to eat all my upload too. Thank you peer guardian...
,bseeds,2008-01-21T12:39Z,"This is legit but fuzzy.
Use VirtualDub to sharpen.
Seeing this flick on the big screen was great.
Watching a fuzzy cam is tedious."
,bseeds,2008-01-21T12:43Z,"You only get one good look at the monster's
face in the entire movie. The cam is so fuzzy
you don't even get that."
