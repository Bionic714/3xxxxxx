The exciting thing for me is to discover how these six pieces - which are included at the beginning of the new release - really complete the recording. They include two pieces ("Police People" and "The Goof Life") where I contributed some more conventional blowing changes for us to play on for the improvised sections to go with Ornette's great melodies - how rare and beautiful to hear Ornette play on structure like that - and three tunes that send the band into areas that were largely unrepresented in the original recording ("Word From Bird","The Veil" and "Computer". The piece "All Of Us" functions mostly as a link.)
