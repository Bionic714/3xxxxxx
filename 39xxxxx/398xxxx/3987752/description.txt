This file runs under Windows as well as Linux

HOWTO

1. make sure you have java installed (www.java.com)

2. for use under Windows, rename the file i2pinstall.jar to i2pinstall.exe 
   and run it
    OR
   for use under Linux or Windows launch the jar file, either by double-clicking 
   it or by running   java -jar i2pinstall.jar

3. make sure, your firewall accepts UDP port 8887 from the outside to your computer

4. run the router: ./runplain.sh OR ./i2prouter start

5. after the installation point your browser to http://localhost:7657/ where you
   find your i2p routers control interface

6. in order to browse the I2P internal web (website URLs ending with ".i2p"),
   make your browser use the proxy http://localhost:4444/ but mention localhost as
   exception (bypassing the proxy) in order to be able to reach the control
   interface.
   
Hint: 
If you want to be able to browse the official internet the same time as the i2p web, use scripts/i2pProxy.pac as automatic proxy configuration URL for your browser.

Hint:
The I2P router tries to get the current list of nodes from http://i2p.net which seems down since two days. If you are experiencing difficulties with connecting to the I2P network, you can find the current router list here: http://i2pdb.tin0.de/

Download the latest zip-File from that directory and unpack it into the netDB subdirectory of your I2P installation directory. Then restart the I2P router.
