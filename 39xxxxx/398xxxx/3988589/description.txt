MPEG Streamclip is a converter, an exporter, a player, an editor, a downloader.

It can open many file formats: muxed files MPEG, MPG, VOB, PS, M2P, MOD, VRO, DAT, DCM, VDR, PVR; transport streams TS, M2T, MTS, MMV, REC, VID, AUD, AVR, TP, TP0, TRP; demuxed files M2V, M1V, MPV, AIFF, AIF, M1A, MP2, MPA, AC3; QuickTime-compatible files MOV, DV, AVI, MP4, DIVX; pictures TIFF, JPEG;

MPEG Streamclip supports MPEG-1 video, MPEG layer 1/2 audio, AC3/A52 audio and PCM audio. MPEG-2 video is supported if you have QuickTime Alternative ($0) and you chose to install the Extra QuickTime plugins.
If you have Apple QuickTime, and do not want to replace it with QuickTime Alternative, you can buy the MPEG-2 Playback Component ($19.99) from Apple Computer.

The program is freeware. Everything what is needed (instructions, QT Lite, MPEG-2 plugin) is included in the package. The program itself does not install in the system, so it does not make any mess in the registry. I use it for transcoding to H.264 and I find it stable. There is a version for Apple platforms.


Enjoy!
