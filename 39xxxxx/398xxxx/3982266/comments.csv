,luther_me,2008-01-18T03:03Z,Thanks to all the people who make this possible.
,GreedosCreations,2008-01-18T03:31Z,"So, this is my first time participating in a request thread, and sure enough, they fulfilled my request! Yay!

However, I noticed that the download was really slow. I realized that this was because I was trying to download only the issues I requested... and that's probably what everyone else was doing too! So I changed my behavior, and am now willing to download the whole pack and seed it; I just hope you guys can do the same for me and everyone else :)."

,oxbladder,2008-01-20T00:15Z,"luther_me, unfortunately ASM 534 didn't make it to the torrent (as well as (some of) the Midnighter stuff. They will be in next week's torrent which should be out on Thursday the 24th of January."
,oxbladder,2008-01-20T00:19Z,"GreedosCreations. The torrents are usually quite large, MB-wise, and it doesn't take much time for lots of leechers to start downloading and if you are the only full seeder each person in the swarm can potentially take up bandwidth. You just have to be a bit patient. It usually takes about 6-8 hours before their are enough seeders to improve the speeds. Whether people only take parts or the whole torrent shouldn't matter as long as they share at least 1:1 the number of seeders should grow and speeds along with it."
