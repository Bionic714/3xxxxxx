,arbyman,2008-05-02T15:10Z,"I think KappaG9 works for Nullsoft as using this serial (or the crack found on this site) on the new version 3.31 totally stops the program from working and uninstalling back to this version stops it from working.  If you have done this (if you are on Leopard) go back to version 3.23, register with the crack (found on this site) then go to Library/PreferancePanes and ctrl click on the Connect360.prefpane and make sure every user has full read write accress.  That will make it work.

After seeing this working on the 360, its no where near as good as streaming from XBMC on the Xbox 1. The video file support is awful and the playback for the supported files is not great quality.  Compare that to XCMC and you can see.  Still, I have to say on the plus side, the communication from Mac to the 360 was effortless."
,hxh103,2008-06-04T02:07Z,"this version does not work for my mac, I have leopard 10.5.3

everything installed fine, but when i try to start it, it won't do anything. 

I installed the newest version right now (3.35) and it worked perfectly, anyone have a key for this?"
,danneo,2008-06-21T02:29Z,Nothing happens when i press start? Help!!!
,urfilipinohero,2008-08-08T09:41Z,"Yea hopefully people read arbyman's comment about kappa's suggestion screwing up it from working.  I knew i should have just bought the damn thing, it's not expensive, i wonder if i do buy it if it'll actually work...  Also, if anyone has a fix for once it gets broken, post it....good dl tho"
,Procrasturbate,2008-10-05T19:15Z,"ver 3.36 takes care of the serial number issue, with a patch.  This version works great:
