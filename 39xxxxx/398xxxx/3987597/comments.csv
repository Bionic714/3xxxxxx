,mluke45,2008-01-21T03:21Z,"without knowing me I can only say trust me, after that it's up to you. I played this in media 11 vlc and 1 other, all play. I spent the last 2 days playing around with ""FAKES"" till this one showed on a site I do trust. it don't look great but it does work"
,DARXYD3,2008-01-21T03:38Z,"I've been burned by THREE fakes so far, if this one turns out to be another fake, I give up."

,mluke45,2008-01-21T04:14Z,john21512 I only said yours might be fake in response to those who said it was. yours may not be a fake and all those sticking to it will find out. I only know mine is not fake.

,605Scorpion,2008-01-21T06:50Z,"Thanks mluke, first working copy of Cloverfield wut wut?
Quality is 7/10.  Not perfect, but for a cam it's very watchable.  There are a few scenes where people get up and walk around, but these are short."
,Ultimathule001,2008-01-21T07:14Z,"Seed, you fucking assholes, and stop leeching."
,Shaolin_sKunk,2008-01-21T13:46Z,please seed!  everyone's stuck at 84.8% with only one seeder.
,nated0323,2008-01-21T19:14Z,its the real movie but bad quality and terrible movie
,falkies,2008-01-22T02:32Z,"perfect!  As stated above, few times where people walk in front of the camera, but otherwise excellent quality!  a=7/10 (a bit echoey) v=8.8/10.  Glad I didn't spend the money to see this and thanks mluke45 for giving us a legit copy!  "
