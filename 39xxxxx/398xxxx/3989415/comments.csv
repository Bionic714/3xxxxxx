,Luke93,2008-02-10T01:26Z,please someone seed! it says 62 seeders im getting  only 5!
,Slaven152,2008-02-24T12:45Z,"I LOVE YOU. I HATE FLAC! 
Why do people upload in FLAC to begin with!? Wtf is wrong with their brains? Lol.

Either way. Thanks for the upload."
,kiryah,2008-03-03T00:43Z,Can someone please seed this? Pretty please? I just joined a new band and we are playing a lot of DT's music. 
,bscone,2008-03-08T19:33Z,"If you had a decent 2 channel system, you would not be asking why people use FLAC. Although an MP3 at 320 sounds darn good, the same song done in FLAC will normally sound much better! 

Simply put : FLAC is lossless and mp3 is lossy."
,wh0carez,2008-03-15T02:01Z,please people seed! it says 130 seeders and no one's seeding I've been trying to download for a couple of days and it's only at 2%
,ZuperZiggen,2008-03-24T09:49Z,SEED!!! FFS!!! It's you non seeders who will ruin bit-torrent one day!
[T],Aufseher,2008-03-31T06:48Z,"I release work in FLAC if I can download other albums in FLAC and put them together, but to save tons of room and just plain user-friendliness, I use 320MP3. FLAC is great for me because I have high quality sound equipment and I can hear the difference, but I know the general music listener doesn't and it just creates more of a hassle for them to convert and put it on their iPods/iTunes/etc. But actually, most of my discographies COME from FLAC sources. Ie. I download a discography of say, Dream Theater in FLAC, then I convert them to 320Kbps MP3s. :)"
,dartb,2008-04-02T19:38Z,I don't have a high spec setup (HD Realtek onboard sound chip with 2.0 speakers) and I can hear the difference.  I prefer mp3 to FLAC simply because it takes up less space although I usually do rip and upload FLAC *shrug*.
,seb101189,2008-04-10T04:36Z,"Took me a couple days to download the whole thing but it's well worth it. All songs are perfect quality, in order, album art, correct title, artist, cd, everything. Thanks for your time in putting this all together!"
