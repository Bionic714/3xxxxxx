,Frippotella,2008-01-24T22:26Z,"Dvd 1 works great, the sound is slightly out of sync but nothing major. But there's something wrong with dvd 2! I mount it with Daemon Tools 4.10 and Windows can't read it! Too bad!"
,lucasdr,2008-02-24T19:42Z,That's shitty. I already had problems rippin it. I thought I had fixed it. I'll look in to it this week and see if I can upload a version that works....

,lucasdr,2008-05-07T11:58Z,"NOTE TO ALL:

THE SECOND DVD DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK IN A DVD PLAYER. I AM TOO LAZY TO UPLOAD A DECENT VERSION.
IF YOU PLAY IT ON A COMPUTER, MOUNT THE ISO FILE AND OPEN THE DATA FILES MANUALLY
