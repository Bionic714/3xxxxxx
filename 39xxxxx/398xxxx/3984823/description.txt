Description:
The main topic of Eckhart's talk at the retreat is stillness. Stillness offers a doorway into the Now and to true personal enlightenment. Too often we become trapped in our mind-created sense of self. Eckhart explains how compulsive our thoughts become as we analyze, interpret, and label every conscious experience we have. In such a state we can no longer perceive the sacredness in ourselves and in that of the natural world around us. Our experience of life becomes nothing but a never-ending reel of thoughts, opinions, and viewpoints.
