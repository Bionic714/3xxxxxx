Japanese cult hero Zatoichi (Shintaro Katsu), who's headlined dozens of films, is a fighter who wields a mighty sword, although he's unable to see because he's blind. In The Festival of Fire, this wandering warrior blows into a town in which women are treated without respect. But he soon teaches the men the value of respect, although it's a struggle to enlighten them.
