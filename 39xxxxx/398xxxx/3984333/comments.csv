,monkiesatemybaby,2008-09-07T09:46Z,"Ive said it before and I'll say it again - I buy MORE than I would have based on the fact that I am exposed to more than I could afford otherwise. In addition, I am made a more saavy, knowledgeable, and informed consumer by the fact that I am exposed to more, once again, than I could afford. I am a happier person because I don't waste my money on crap, I only purchase media that I have tried and know work and/or satisfy my needs. If I didn't get to try things I wouldn't buy nearly as much as I do because I'm not going to waste my money when I know from experience that most (I said MOST, not SOME) software is crap, bloatware, over-priced and under-featured, or entirely inappropriate for my needs. Music and film is the same. Instead of going to the cinema once or twice a year as was my norm, I go much more because I know the film I am goin to see is worth seeing in the cinema. I buy more CDs because I know I like them. I prefer to own the official copies for the art and so on, but I don't buy crap I want, and have missed many releases because I couldn't be sure and didn't want to waste my money. Sharing is marketing, and the asstards who don't understand that are falling far behind the learning curve of future business. I loved Steal This Movie and Steal This Movie 2 (TPB search them if you haven't seen them, they're an education) and I'm looking forward to this one as well. Arrrr mateys, keep up the great work!"
,monkiesatemybaby,2008-09-07T09:51Z,Brilliant. I'm saving it to my phone to show all my friends at work. Is that stealing? Fuck if I know lmao

,llortamai,2009-04-13T00:41Z,Stealing is Wrong! You should be ashamed.
