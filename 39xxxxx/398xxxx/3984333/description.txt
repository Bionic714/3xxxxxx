Whenever you rent a movie, the multinational media industry forces you to watch their propaganda. They claim that [downloading movies is the same as snatching bags, stealing cars or shoplifting]. That's simply not true - making a copy is fundamentally different from stealing.


The media industry has failed to offer viable legal alternatives and they will fail to convince consumers that sharing equals stealing. Unfortunately, they have succeeded in another area - lobbying to adapt laws to criminalize sharing, turning consumers into criminals. They argue that their laws are necessary to support artists, but in reality all they're protecting is their own profits.

The Greens in Europe and worldwide has been opposing these laws. We believe that consumers are willing to pay if offered good quality at a fair price. We also believe that sharing is expanding culture - not killing it.

To protest against the faulty propaganda from the industry, we made our own film. The difference is - you can choose whether you want to watch this one.
