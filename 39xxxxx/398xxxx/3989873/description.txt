Ron Paul Money Bomb http://freeatlast2008.com/

MONDAY - JANUARY 21 - DOUBLE FEATURE:

A grass roots campaign organized by VIJAY BOYAPATI travels the country as they canvas the major cities going door to door stumping for Ron Paul in an effort to turn out the vote. What is most unique - - - these volunteers quit their jobs (Vijay quit his job as an engineer at Google) as the ultimate commitment to organize for Ron Paul - fully grasping that this is our LAST CHANCE to save the Republic and ALL of our cherished freedoms.
