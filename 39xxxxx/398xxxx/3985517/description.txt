Spiral Architect is a Norwegian progressive metal band named after a Black Sabbath song. They have recorded two acclaimed demos and one album, A Sceptic's Universe, since they began in 1993, as well as a Fates Warning cover "A Prelude To Ruin" for the tribute album Through Different Eyes - A Tribute to Fates Warning.

A Sceptic's Universe is the first and as of 2007 only full length studio album released by Spiral Architect, a Norwegian technical metal band. The album is known for its dizzying and varied time signatures, as well as for singer ?yvind HÃ¦geland's unique style of wailing clean vocals. The album is also characterized by a thin lead guitar sound, which further complements the upfront sound of the bass.
