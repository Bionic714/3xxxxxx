Paige had been missing for two months (circa September 2007) along with her boyfriend, pornographic director Inkyo Volt Hwang (more commonly known as Chico ""Wanker"" Wang), as rumors circulated about her possible demise. Hwang had been arrested on June 29, 2007, on charges related to beating and kidnapping Haley, but the charges were dropped and Hwang was released on July 3, 2007. Haley and Hwang married on August 2, 2007.[1][7][8]

It was later confirmed that Haley had died in King City, California, where she had traveled with Hwang. A coroner's report indicated that she died on August 21, 2007.[1] According to her family, she was buried in a small intimate ceremony, which combined elements of the BahĂĄ'Ă­ and Roman Catholic faiths.[9]

AVN reported that there was a ""circulated rumor that Haley died of a heroin overdose"", however, a spokesman for the Monterey County Coroner's Office stated that Haley did not have any track marks that would indicate this cause of death, though overdose by smoking heroin could not be ruled out.[1] However, Sgt. Steve Miller, of the King City Police Department, disclosed that Hwang had been ""implicated"" in her death.[10]

Hwang's dead body was later discovered in a room at an Economy Inn in Morgan Hill, California on September 29, 2007.[10][11]

His death was ""not being considered suspicious"" according to Morgan Hill police investigators. The investigators also stated that he was likely headed north due to the investigation in King City.[10]



Porn actress Haley Paige?s body was found on August 21st 2007 in King City, California. She had been missing for over 2 months as rumors circulated about her possible death from a heroin overdose. It turned out that Paige, 25, was murdered. In July of 2007, Paige?s husband, Inkyo Volt Hwang, aka Chico ?Wanker? Wang, had been arrested and later released in connection with the kidnapping, pistol-whipping and torture of Paige. Hwang, a porn director, had a history of violence toward women and had served a 2 year sentence in the late 90?s for the kidnapping and rape of a girlfriend. Shortly after Hwang?s release on the kidnapping charges he and Paige were married in Las Vegas. After Haley?s body was found Hwang was questioned and released by police. On September 29th 2007 Hwang?s body was found in an Economy Inn motel in Morgan Hill, California. The results of a toxicology report are pending although there is a strong possibility that Hwang took his own life realizing that he was the primary suspect in Paige?s murder. Hwang, pictured below, may have been on the run at the time of his death."
