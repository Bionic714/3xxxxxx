HR xx"
,Japzer,2008-01-24T10:45Z,"Can i ask how you converted these to .mp4? Been trying to transcode .mkv's to .mp4's for a while now, but never managed to produce files playable on my xbox360. As these are playable, I'm hoping you can tell me how you did it. TIA"
,xghoulx,2008-01-25T02:11Z,are these HDTV rips? or they from iTunes?
,hooghlyrocks,2008-01-27T04:20Z,"Japzer
These were indeed ripped from MKV files.  I downloaded the original files in 720p format (H.264 AAC) and then popped them into a program called Visual Hub; selected, Apple TV, High Quality with some extra ffmpeg flags for best encoding quality
(-refs 2 -mbd 2 -me full -subq 6 -me_range 21 -me_threshold 6 -i_qfactor 0.71428572)

Oh and it was done on my MacBook Pro.  Fraid you need a Mac for VisualHub.... if you got a PC then am not sure what would be best to use.  I tried Googling a PC alternative however I could not see anything.

Nice to hear that these all work on the XBox 360....  anyone else got these files working on any other platform?

Oh and I will be publishing Lost in the same format as and when they are broadcast/encoded/downloaded/transcoded and then finally uploaded on here ;0)"
,hooghlyrocks,2008-01-27T04:24Z,"xghoulx
These are broadcast/encoded/downloaded/transcoded MP4 files that will work in iTunes (and the xBox360 so says Japzer)

These have NOT been downloaded from iTunes and somehow stripped of DRM... no no no"
,Raothi,2008-02-05T02:35Z,Cant download. Broken code?
,utdarkviper,2008-02-08T14:54Z,worked for me and i started it 2-3 days ago... its gunna take a while...
,hooghlyrocks,2008-02-10T16:59Z,all looks live from my end too...
,McKinley,2008-02-11T02:32Z,Samn nice quality but where are the rest episodes of season 2?
,hooghlyrocks,2008-02-12T02:08Z,"ID:McKinley
That is your lot for season two I am afraid....
Would loved to have said that there was more but due to the writers strike in the US that is it.
As you can see in E11 they mention the end of Chapter Two and the start of Chapter Three...  that will be the third series...
Hope you enjoy what little there is of S2

HOOGHLYRocks!!!!"
,Bananahammockz,2008-03-03T08:13Z,"Thanks a lot, Hooghly - U RAWK!! Finally some iTunes-ready stuff around here without conversion nightmares ...

Q: What are the audio- and video bitrate of the files?"
,monoclone,2008-03-09T12:34Z,would have been cool if more tv shows and movies ready for apple tv were being seeded here.
,hooghlyrocks,2008-03-11T13:39Z,"mitter: These are HD copies of the show and are too high a bit-rate and resolution to play on the iPod unless you convert them - which I guess you have done

Bananahammockz: not too sure what the bit rates are, think that the app I use varies depending on the input video.... you can check this info either on iTunes (CTRL+I) to check the info on the file (same in Quicktime to check)

monoclone: Check out my Lost HD rips, they are HD iTunes ready (and also play on PS3 and XBox360)

can you change your naming convention?  My filesystem doesn't support using | pipes...

thanks ahead of time,

-ren"
,hooghlyrocks,2008-03-19T17:08Z,"rehndawg: cheers for the heads up...  won't use | going forward in folder or file names (will still use in torrent title)
Oh and what system you using?
Oh oh and I am not going to re-publish this one.... too well established..."
,DamienVnc,2008-03-20T12:28Z,"Yeah, please seed when you're finished. Don't just erase the torrent. Otherwise others won't be able to enjoy fine quality tvshows."
,hooghlyrocks,2008-03-21T19:16Z,well said DamienVnc
,riddleren,2008-03-27T08:50Z,Thank you hooghlyrocks. This looks to be by far the best Heroes seasonal releases yet. Thank you. Very nice work.
,Bananahammockz,2008-04-07T15:07Z,"Thank you so much hooghly!! Awesome quality, and it went straight to my Apple TV. Didn't have to waste my afternoon re-encoding. :)

Keep it up!"
,supersteve1982,2008-04-11T09:36Z,"These work perfectly on my PC however I can't get them to work on my PS3 or Xbox 360? Can anyone offer any guidance?

Cheers"
,hooghlyrocks,2008-04-28T00:45Z,"Hey supersteve1982, I know that you can stream your music to both your XBox and PS3 with WMP11 however this will not play MP4 files.

Have a look at http://tversity.com/home I am sure that it can do what you want.  :0)"
,son of a bitch,2008-05-15T20:41Z,"Thanks for this Hooghlyrocks!

Hey supersteve1982, are you trying to stream it from your pc? Try putting it on a flash drive, it's played perfectly on my Xbox 360."
,crumper,2008-05-17T17:05Z,"Use Zune to stream these files to 360 from Windows PC.

Videora 360 is a decent PC alternative to visualhub. I've successfully converted 720p mkv files to this format (mp4 h.264 aac) with it. Takes about 4hr per hr. 5Mb/s bitrate. Looks great. Does 1 click queues too for overnight runs."
,xD3ATHN0T3x,2008-05-27T00:13Z,"season 1 ?
Can u UL?"
,hooghlyrocks,2008-06-03T13:15Z,Clarpet2: what codec are you using with WMP Classic?
,hooghlyrocks,2008-06-21T21:37Z,"SUPERSEEDERS needed!

Going to be seeding Heroes S1 in the same format at this release...

,eatmorephish,2008-07-11T05:25Z,I've been on this torrent now for going on 2 weeks. I'M CRAWLING AT 5.0 kb/sec. I'm talking 56k modem speed here! Can I please get some decent seeds! I'm uploading at max capacity here!
,takeawildguess777,2008-07-25T17:10Z,"Audio was off for me too. Also used the MPC option to offset the sound by -900ms. Only started the first ep so far, so I don't know if this problem persists.

Video quality appears good."
,McF,2008-07-30T22:43Z,"hooghlyrocks you are the man, series 2 in glorious high def, muchos respectos 

i downloaded this to play on my xbox 360 but for some reason it wouldnt pick up the .mp4 file extension. a quick rename of the files to .wmv sorted this out and now plays like a dream.

audio and video appear to be in sync for me, although i have only had a quick look at all the episodes.

thanks again"
,dozer911,2008-08-01T14:53Z,"Come on you guys! Im uploading 100+ kB/s here.... Give a little:-)
Thnx"
,MatBailie,2008-09-21T02:14Z,"I had audio sync issues too.  I also notice is that the first couple seconds of video seemed massively sped up...

I renamed the files to .avi and everything sorted it self out.  But this stops me seeding the files.

Anyone know why this may be?  Or have a better solution?  (-900 ms in MediaPlayer Classic, rename to .avi, both seem naff)"
,Armaments,2008-09-27T00:13Z,"Once I have finished downloading, I will upload at 5Mb/s for a few weeks. Thanks hooghlyrocks!"
