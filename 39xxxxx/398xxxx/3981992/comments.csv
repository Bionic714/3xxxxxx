[T],crane_man,2008-01-19T17:29Z,you can make it full screen from wide screen in your ipod video settings    go back and look at your setting on the ipod again   its not a software issue
,erdemc,2008-01-23T03:06Z,i tried fullscreen works on your videos but not mine i guess im doing something wrong on nero are you using nero vision or nero recode ? because i tried ripping a dvd yesterday with recode and it worked but when i used vision to convert avi(xvid) to ipod the converted resolution was 320x240 which shoulda been 320x188 have you ever tried videora? i tried it today and works perfectly fine im gonna use it thanks anyway
