                     Thank you very much indeed!"
,vigibigi,2008-01-22T19:03Z,":-) no problem,
to install CD2 copy all files from the image to a folder on your hard drive and replace the existing setup.inx file with this one: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3941073/Jeppview_setup.inx
Click ""Next"" and ""OK"" several times and the installation will continue without serial key.
Have fun!"

,RAF_Ascot,2008-01-30T18:18Z,"Hi all, works great for the IFR and military charts in the UK however some of the smaller fields like Cosford (EGWC) say they are on VFR charts, does the full coverage serial cover VFR and i need to activate it some how or is a separate code for VFR terminal charts needed?"
,RAF_Ascot,2008-02-02T13:17Z,"Lionkingz,

Open the CD 2 image file, copy all the contents to a temporary folder for example, ""jeppview"" on your desktop, 

Download the setup.inx, 

Put the downloaded setup.inx into your ""jeppview"" temp folder and overrite when asked to. 

Then run the setup exe in the temp folder then accept the warnings that keep popping up and it will install.

P.S any news on VFR Coverage codes?"

,evgeni166,2008-02-06T13:21Z,"i am thankful  ..... this ""thepiratebay.ors/jeppview"" is the best of the web"
,RAF_Ascot,2008-02-06T17:24Z,"@zmaster007
Thanks works perfectly."
,RAF_Ascot,2008-02-08T10:37Z,"@thelionkingz

Jeppview only do European VFR by the looks of things. And the other countries come with VFR Airports on full coverage.

Press Ctrl+G in jeppview and click the all areas tab, tells you what they do and what you can ""buy"" (the first tab is where you input new codes after you install it)

So really to get everything you only need VFR Europe and Full Coverage."

But wit me something is wrong . I have updated 0723 with 0724 and the data is still from 0723 . Exept that now I have bloked with a msg. : 
""Your terminal chart subscription is more than 10 weeks out of date.
Please install the latest Electronic Chart Data CD to update the database.""

Thank you very much . It is really usefull . Now the old data from 0723 is readable .
But why did we download 0724 ? Why this version was uploaded if there is not some way to use it ?
Two main qustions and I cant explain them to myself .
