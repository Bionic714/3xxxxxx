[T],despo1ler,2008-01-18T21:36Z,"Another movie company anti peer2peer campaigner and plenty of people are doing his job for him by downloading and continueing to spread his torrent.

If you want to test if a download is genuine when it is saved in avi format then have your torrent client save downlaods in the original format not .bc incomplete files, once it gets to 5-10% you can try to play the film in VLC media player, if it is a genuine avi file then VLC, which is freeware and plays every format I've tried so far, will attempt to repair the file and will be able to play a few scenes or a bit of sound while domplayer fakes etc will not try to repair and will just try to run thru the file but show nothing but a moving slider. Even at 5% a real AVI will show SOMETHING, test suspect downloads long b4 they finish downloading and delete them before they spread.
pls copy/paste this to other suspected fakes "
