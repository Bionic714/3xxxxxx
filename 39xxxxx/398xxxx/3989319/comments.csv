,stelfy,2008-05-02T04:41Z,"picture 7/10
audio 7.5/10

it's a good film, and thanks for the upload, but i've seen it on dvd, and it looks much better than this.
 i turned it off when i realised that even Monica Bellucci didn't look good on my screen."
,woxthewox,2008-05-28T03:13Z,SEED people I'll seed for you guys once I'm done.. this is taking forever for me
,woxthewox,2008-05-28T03:13Z,"oh and boycutt doesn't know a fucking thing about what happens in Nigeria..  
he's just another redneck who isn't man enough to admit that shit happens.."
,LmEnt.,2008-09-24T01:24Z,"No, boycutt is correct, This DIDN'T happen in Nigera..... It unfortunatley DID happen in the early to mid 70's IN THE CONGO JUNGLE... I have a older friend that was in the Canadian Militay that had the task of Paratrooping into to the hot zone and 85% thats right 85% of his Platoon was DEAD before they hit the ground... And the part of the movie where the rebels are brutely killing the villiagers actually happened as well, but they weren't giving thegreen light to intervien, his group had to sit by and watch it happen until the commanders gave the go ahead, but by then it was too late for the innocent women and children..... So boycutt you need to TAKE YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS VERY SLOWLY AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH SO YOU DON'T GO INTO FUCKING SHOCK.... Do your fucking research before you even attempt to share your bullshit air-headed comments with people who now know you are retarded......
And cootoes to woxthewox..........."
,harigata,2008-10-10T03:40Z,"Ex'use me,
but who the fuck is boycutt?

From what I've read about what's going on in Africa, things that happened in this fictional war are commonplace in their frequent wars and civil strife. But I'm sure they ain't accompanied buy that african-american (not black. African American!) woman whining in the BG during the most dramatic moments....

stelfy,
I really don't understand you people. You're CRAAAAZY about getting the very finest super-quality. I think this is taking things way too far. I'm very happy with the quality of this upload. Don't need nothin' more.

But, whatever makes you happy : )"
