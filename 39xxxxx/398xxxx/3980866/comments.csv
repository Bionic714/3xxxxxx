,Toni0907,2008-03-05T00:37Z,"Hi,
 Yes, I am an avid movie collector. Yes, I have seen many movies slip through the cracks.  I was wondering if you could help me? I need Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Lady Vengeance (aka..Symapthy for Lady Vengeance) with hardcoded english subtitles. I cant seem to get the subtitles work correctly. :-( I would greatly appreciate it. If you come across Oldboy as well. Thank you for the download, I will seed it for awhile for you. Take Care."
