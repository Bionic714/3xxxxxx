Note from the ripper: 
Hello everyone. I`ve noticed that a lot of good movies have slipped through the cracks of the ripping community. Some movies are no where to be found. If you are an avid movie collector, like myself, than you know exactly what I`m talking about. I am dedicated to bringing you all the good movies that you just can`t seem to find, so you can fill those unseemly holes in your collection. 
When it comes to quality, I have one golden rule: If I wouldn`t put it in my own collection, than I wouldn`t post it.
