North Africa is Arab, Central is Black, and South was barren till Dutch and English moved there after whaling port city was established. The only Blackd that are know to be near the south, were nomadic San People and Zulu's near the border of Zimbabwe.

Today Blacks have taken over South Africa, helped by the likes of united Nations and other Communists."
