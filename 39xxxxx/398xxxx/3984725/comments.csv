,cool_midnight_rambler,2008-01-20T09:32Z,"Thats a scary amount of fandom work, but I'm pleased that Han now shoots first again.

Also, i too prefered the original edition.

Thanks."
,rageofthemage,2008-01-29T15:06Z,"as a HUGE fan of the original trilogy... this sucks. For one reason and one reason only... Greedo shot first. I mean it's pretty much undisputed internet fact now. Don't believe me? Just wiki that shit. Besides, I personally don't mind the ""special"" editions all that much. it's the ""special dvd"" edition that yanks my crank in the wrong direction. Where they remove sebastian shaw from the end scene in return of the jedi, and replace him with hayden whatshisface... I dunno, to me this re-cut is much of the same kind of thing, it's taking a classic movie and messing about with something that should maybe just be left well enough alone."
,Ioz-of-Mer,2008-01-31T06:45Z,"This is, by far, my favorite version of the original Star Wars (aka ""A New Hope""). This even beats the DarthEditious version in every way. The enhancements were subtly done and the corrections, such as the fixed ""sheathing/extending"" light-saber jump-cuts were flawlessly executed. I also appreciate the fact that the light sabers were all re-rotoscoped to make them more closely match the look, and more importantly, the hue, of the lightsabers in the other Star Wars films. The duel between Vader and Obi Wan was extended and enhanced with a perfect balance of the old and the new that still leaves me wondering how the hell they did it, and seeing the enhanced Death Star battle was like watching it again for the first time... only better. It was reminiscent of the space battle scenes of Jedi and Phantom Menace, yet it fit in seamlessly with the existing footage & soundtrack. 

Many of the numerous changes are too subtle to keep track of, but most of the obvious additions were done to give the film a better sense of continuity with the various other ""Episodes."" Star Wars Revisited is so ""insanely great"" that Lucasfilm should buy this version and release it on DVD.

For the Star Wars fan who disliked ""Greedo shooting"" and the added ""Jabba scene"" but appreciated some of the visual enhancements and corrections of the re-releases, this is the version for you."
,Ioz-of-Mer,2008-01-31T06:51Z,"Kudos to 'boon238' for posting this with its complete Specs & Summary. If this file wasn't accompanied by its more-than-thorough information sheet, I might not have experienced the wonder that is Star Wars Revisited.

Many thanks! I'll keep seeding this for as long as I can. "
,jmy1701,2008-02-18T04:44Z,This is the BEST version of Star Wars I have ever seen!!! I like the way the music from all six films is blended into it and the tweaked FX just help to make an allready GREAT film better. When will we see this same treatment given to the other films?
,MarilynMansonsZ28,2008-09-04T05:09Z,"i like it, but it shows up as some weird files on my mac, i can view them, but its all in small cutt up VOB files,, anyone know wat i should do?"
,MarilynMansonsZ28,2008-09-04T06:58Z,are we supposed to burn these to a disk ur what?
,Darth_Scourge,2008-09-11T14:10Z,"Supercalifrickin'AWESOME!

I pledge myself to your teachings, Master Adywan."
,Darth_Scourge,2008-09-11T14:16Z,"oh, and to rageofthemage...re Greedo shooting first...""Pretty much undisputed internet fact""? Not if you saw the '77 version for twenty years. 

This is perfect, now Han is back to his ""scoundrel"" ways, the CGI is all up to date, the Hand on the floor in the Cantina brawl scene is EVAZAN'S - he was the one with the blaster (the version I DL'd had this and not the hoof).

Shame the Alderaan destruction scene couldnt be seamlessly integrated, but the little scene where you see JAR JAR DIE is just classic!"
,MarilynMansonsZ28,2008-10-12T06:52Z,"how do you work the menu's? its all cropped in sections,, what would you use to play these all together and make the menu workable?"
,MarilynMansonsZ28,2008-11-30T04:43Z,stopped at 89% and says needs more sources....
,nhudell,2011-04-28T18:35Z,"Please forgive the newbie comment, but is this the most up to date version of Adywan's fanedit?"
,Mikeman2000,2011-08-13T04:18Z,"Hey rageofthemage... You're a dumb fuck! A TRUE fan of the trilogy knows that in the original theatrical version, not only does Han shoot first, but he's the ONLY one who shoots. It was in the 1997 special edition that they added in Greedo's shot, mainly because they recognized that children might idolize Han, and didn't want to make him look like a heartless killer. Oh, and about the ""undisputed internet fact"" shit, well, I'm sorry to tell you this, but the internet lies, dear. A lot. Anyway, since you're obviously not a fan of Star Wars, and probably haven't even seen any of the films other than the last 10 minutes of The Revenge of the Sith, I'm going to separate you from the rest of the human race. Just like the Christians. Goodbye."
,calideson,2012-07-08T07:42Z,"Is anyone else getting the video, but no sound?

Also, I can't believe there's actually anyone who thinks that Greedo originally shot first!"
