From IMDB.com :

Following the death of his father in Mexico, Stéphane Miroux, a shy insecure young man, agrees to come to Paris to draw closer to his widowed mother Christine. He lands a boring job at a calendar-making firm and falls in love with his charming neighbor Stéphanie.

This is a great, high quality iPod/iPhone/iTunes mpeg4 file.  One of my favourite films!
