This doen't work"
,Mnemosyne,2008-03-18T04:39Z,"I just downloaded this and the serial works fine for me. 

When you install, during the installation, you are informed at there is a newer version and you're asked if you want to update to the new version. I clicked no on that, and then was able to enter the serial fine. It may be that if you allow it to update, the serial doesn't work anymore."

,Petetech888,2010-12-29T22:14Z,"Thanks nalalan, much appreciated."
,PJMorgan,2011-01-02T06:50Z,Is the serial supposed to be entered in the place where you go to save the files and it asks for information? I didn't do the upgrade but putting that information from the serial in that spot wasn't working for me. Might have been doing it wrong. Any suggestions?
