,merrytyme,2008-01-22T18:24Z,"""Uber"" any advice on seeding would be welcome, be a love and let me know, Little new to this lark and would immensely benefit from some sound advice such as yours. "
,death734,2008-01-23T03:19Z,"well best advice is use 256k piece size when making the torrent and dont superseed or initial seed.

also i know you are doing 720p to try to get hd quality but mean while at this file size and 1.5mbps bitrate it would actually come out at better quality if you did a resolution like 960x544 (hr res) or 848x480 (dvd res)"
,merrytyme,2008-01-23T04:08Z,"Thank you death734, good info, I do want hi res, I will try that on my next torrent, and I did try to superseed, I think that messed me up. This is a learning process for me, thank you for helping in that process."
,missywissy78,2008-01-29T13:03Z,"can someone please upload episode 4!!
Please !"
,cyberdraknor,2008-02-04T05:32Z,Is this like most shows where the pilot is actually the first 2 episodes?
,DisabledTrucker,2008-03-04T14:23Z,"Leave it at the 720p and use 3-5000 for the bit rate with 160 for the audio, it will create a video that works with the aTV.  (Apple recommends using 5000 for this size video.)  Make sure it's two pass encodes with best quality audio.  Sure it takes a tad longer to export, but you get the best quality rip you can with these settings, I've done most of the series this way and it works perfect every time.  Granted you come away with 2 GB size files but it's well worth it IMHO."
