horribly written and even more horribly acted.

the plot bounces around and NOTHING in the story ever ""grabs"" you. 

you will find the main character to be extermely annoying and almost oblivous to being pregnat at 16. I had a child when I was 15 and never once was so air-headed about the situation.
as far as quality: Video 7/10
                          Audio 9/10

,HurtByTheSun,2008-04-15T13:43Z,"Quality is fine, but here's my official review:

I watched Juno earlier today. It was the most self absorbed piece of shit film I've seen since 'Garden State', which at least had a semi-reasonable soundtrack to save it.

For those who don't know, it's the tale of a girl who gets knocked up at the tender age of 16 and how she copes with the situation. This isn't just any normal 16 year old, no way sir, this is one of those irritating precocious ones who think that they know everything at such a young age; she's 'street' and savvy, despite having what seems to be a relatively normal and comfortable up-bringing. Let's face it though, we've all been there and part of my hatred of this movie possibly stems from realising that I did some massively retarded things at the same age. However, I like to think that I grew up a little, and for this particular little cocksmith, Juno, I can see only a bleakly opinionated future built around ill-informed opinions based on ignorance and extensive research of WikiPedia.

There were two good things about the movie, however, one of them being the father who was far and away the best character. He had a deep and beautiful voice which was a triumph of sound for whoever recorded him. He also had the best line in the film about 'Punching that kid in the weiner', which sounds childish and out of place, but delivered a much needed shot of realism and wit into a scene that was so dripping with smug self awareness I literally screamed. Her step mother was also excellent yet I constantly forget the name of the woman who plays her, driving my viewing partner to distraction with constant questions of 'Who the fuck is that?'. Apparently she was in 'American Beauty', which was great until that fucking plastic bag scene. I reserve a special part of my heart for hating that 'beautiful' scene.

The other great thing was watching that cunt of a child Ellen Page get fat. Seriously, she's annoying and pretentious and has a face I'd never tire of beating. I can't decide if I hate her more in this or 'Hard Candy', which at least had a cool story and has far better cinematography. The thing that truly terrifies me about this thunder-cunt is that she's young and will probably make a hell of a lot more movies in her life-time. She even sucked in X-Men, and that's pretty difficult to do given that the movie has a guy with an invincible metal skeleton. A metal fucking skeleton, how cool is that? She has the kind of face I would never tire of punching; were she on fire I would not piss on her. Any cliched statement about hatred you care to add, feel free to do so. If she's the future of acting, I think I'll stick pins in my eyes so that there's no way I can see her hideous face ever again. The girl has a fucking speech impediment and teeth that don't really fit in her mouth. Given a hammer and chisel, I could remedy that situation for her and save a lot of people from having to listen to her.

Her boyfriend, who was a drippy, sappy cunt in 'Superbad' (but at least funny) was such a total fucking loser that I constantly begged for his death. I wish he'd stop being such a pathetic cunt in films and start growing a pair of testicles or at the very least pubes. He's also a weird looking bastard who looks to have a touch of the reptile about him, leading me to conclude that his mother fucked a lizard, or at the very least a snake. The idea that this pathetic excuse for a teenager could have managed to get someone to have sex with him is laughable. That he even produces sperm is even further from the truth and it really concerns me that whoever inflicted this upon us thinks we're stupid enough to believe he's capable of getting anything but piss out of his pencil thin limp dick excuse for a cock. I think it says it all that in one of his previous jobs, he played the role of 'Crying Kid' in what is almost certainly a TV nightmare, name of 'Walter and Henry'.

I have absolutely no idea why this shit-can of a film is getting jizzed all over by people, specifically Americans who latch o"
