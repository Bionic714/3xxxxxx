,littlemuppet,2008-01-22T05:23Z,"Madeleine McCann Screensaver

I in no way wish to imply this screensaver is sanctioned by the McCann's, it's completly my own doing.
Being a father myself I can't imagine what Madeleine's parents are going  through. I made this screensaver
and sent it to all my friends hoping in some small way to keep Madeleine's profile active. Please use this 
on your own machine and all your friends.
No matter what your opinions are about Madeleine's disappearance are, please try and remember a little
four year old girl is at the centre of this and hopefully she will be found alive and well.

All hope and prayers for Madeleine's safe return"
