,finalfantasyhero,2008-01-21T19:06Z,"I'll stick it on my download list just incase you realise the concept of seeding, and then I, who understands the concept of seeding, shall share with others.  Great game btw, probably my favourite.  I own it on ps1 but the wife complains about me hogging the tv for gaming, so I'm trying to get everything onto my laptop.  Seed and share people :)"
