Vinyl rip's of 12" versions of two lesser known Wailers tunes sung by the original Wailers line up of Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, Constantine "Vision" Walker, and Junior Brathwaite. These songs exist in other places in other forms, especially Nice Time. But theses are longer and different versions than you've probably heard before. I believe these versions are out of print and are very difficult to find today. Album sleeve photos are included in the torrent.
