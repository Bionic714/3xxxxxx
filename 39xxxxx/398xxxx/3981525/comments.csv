,quiproquo,2008-01-17T19:25Z,"Be careful, though, folks! Office's Installer deletes all of Word 2004 before installing new Word, and Word, under Leopard, crashes! Therefore, be careful again if you don't want to have no Wordf version available on your Mac! To learn more about this damned sistuation, go to MacFixIt. IMO, it's bettewr to wait for the first update or patch from Microsft."
,jellings,2008-01-17T21:10Z,"I installed the home & student edition and the installer *asked* whether i wanted to remove office 2004, and i just said no. i would assume that this version is the same.

also if 2008 doesn't work just use the uninstaller file that is in the office 2008 folder and reinstall 2004? "
,iedric,2008-01-17T21:57Z,Quiproquo is right: I've installed Office 2008 under 10.5 and it crashes like fucking hell. Entourage doesn't even want to start!!!
,jockboy,2008-01-17T22:18Z,not sure what you guys problem is but Office 2008 S&T edition works fine for me under 10.5.1

,bradfantin,2008-01-17T22:54Z,what does exchange support enable me to do?
,MaccTuna,2008-01-17T23:52Z,"@Bradfantin

If you dont know what it is, you wont need it.

I have no clue why theres like 10 different torrents now, and on most ppl are complaining about it not working.

I got this one, works like a charm on Leopard 10.5.1, no hassle, no crashes, clean install. No point in QQ-ing when a torrent fails to work, get another one or read comments before posting your whine.

That said, HF with office 2008 it looks great!

,arbyman,2008-01-18T13:48Z,"Just to confirm, I used the Beta and this is not a Beta! Nothing has been hacked and it is a full release working perfectly under Leopard.  Exchange also works.  I would recommend not checking the box to remove 2004 though until you are 100% happy with 2008.  I found a bug with PowerPoint in showing a shadow of the text on bullet points before the text shows on the screen in slide show mode."
,iedric,2008-01-18T22:56Z,"@Bradfantin, uf, your comment is also a whine. 

The installation worked perfectly, but when I started Word and Entourage it crashed and kept crashing. Read: http://www.macfixit.com/article.php?story=20080118113937223"
,trunkjunk,2008-01-19T05:27Z,Where's the serial #?
,yabos,2008-01-20T17:12Z,"My Word crashes as well.  All the other apps work, just word.  I'll be waiting for someone to hopefully upload a non corrupted word template file because I'm not creating a new user on my system just to fix fucking microsoft's shit.  "
,processcolour,2008-01-21T04:09Z,"Maybe think about giving NeoOffice a shot if Office is giving you the shits. It does everything Word does, has a similar GUI but handles fonts better, it's never crashed for me, it's Open Source and doesn't have the poxy talking paperclip. Oh, and it's free. 

I haven't opened Word in over 12 months even though I use .docs all the time in my workflow. (I sound like a fucking ad, but using NeoOffice solved heaps of problems I had with Word.) www.neooffice.org

Try it once you've dl'd the torrent."

ur welcome!"
,macwel99,2008-01-28T01:39Z,"Works perfect for me. I had Office 2004 on the new Mac OS and I installed. Works perfect. No crashes ... noting. But the sync with exchange still sucks. No Task support and sync on calendar is many times wrong. Good to know, so I dont need to buy and can stay on my Neo Office."
