Spark you always know when the real versions are out because studio spammers like chick_nut switch from spamming the site with fake torrents to trolling the message section with cries of ""Fake!""

,jaymalmat,2008-01-21T06:16Z,"This is not a Fake. I downloaded it, verified, made a torrent, and currently seeding the hell out of it. Whats a ""blank movie anyways""? It's Real."
,jaymalmat,2008-01-21T06:23Z,I wouldn't post fake torrents like other idiots. Thats a big waste of my time and theres only 24 hours in a day where I live and wouldn't waste any of it by posting shit torrents that shouldn't be posted.

  Jay in your opinion is this version noticably higher quality then the 481mb verion?"

I also have a streaming preview at videoshare.homeip.net [Click the ""torrent previews""  link center top]. The previews have been encoded to .swf but shouldn't matter to see quality.(or lack of)"

,treebuey,2008-01-21T16:24Z,"definitely 100$ REAL.Kudos to those that tried to make this viewable. However,  this might be a movie that is damn near impossible to CAM well.. Since much of the moview is meant to appear to be CAM based already, you can just imagine.... I am going to try to watch this tonight but I can't wait for the DVD screener to appear!."
