AFRICA 100 - AFROBEAT 7 CD BOX


Afrobeat is a sound and a movement, music and a state of mind. It's the joyous awakening of a continent from a colonial nightmare and the crushing realization that the nightmare isn't over yet, anguish and happiness whipped together with traditional drums, cheap guitars, and even cheaper amps.

Afrobeat is a term with no solid definition, like punk, rock, or soul, although it may be all three of those things. No one knows who first used the word, but as far as history is concerned, it belongs to Fela Anikulapo Kuti, the late Nigerian giant through whom any understanding of the sound of 1970s Africa must pass. In the most limited sense, you could say that Afrobeat is the cinematic, polyrhythmic, symphonic funk sound that Fela developed with superhuman drummer Tony Allen, but it's much more than that.

For what has been recovered, distribution can be spotty, and the shop that has two things you're looking for is usually missing four other things you want to check out. Compilers of these sounds must track down the musicians, hunt out masters in forgotten, crumbling pressing plants, and sift through bins of scratched, dusty vinyl in the markets of Accra, Conakry, and Lagos looking for the lost slab of brilliant funk or the 45 with the highlife A-side and the totally unexpected fuzz-rock B-side. The rewards of those efforts have been huge, though, and I'm pleased this music is increasingly getting the spotlight it deserves.

Compiled by music writer Joe Tangari to accompany "The Indestructible Beat", his five-part April 2005 Pitchfork feature on the origins and history of Afrobeat and related genres, this home-assembled box set compiles 99 songs (a "vinyl-only" bonus track is unavailable here), and spans from the late 1950s to the present day, with a special focus on the genre's most active and fertile decade, the 1970s. Containing almost nine hours of music, it is now the most definitive collection of Afrobeat known to exist, and possibly the most thorough introduction to the music available.

For the uninitiated, Afrobeat, in its purest form, it is intensely beat-heavy, drawing as much inspiration from American funk, soul and jazz as from aboriginal chants and rhythms. Allmusic.com states that its musicians tended to favor large ensembles, extended grooves and improvised jam sessions, but that at its core it was dance music. Over the course of the the 1970s, however, many varieties and mutations would spring up, each drawing from more distant forms. On this collection, influences range from James Brown's good-foot funk, to Detroit's Motown R&B and soul, to Lee "Scratch" Perry and King Tubby's dub reggae, to even Serge Gainsbourg's sultry French whispers.
