I hope I find some great tracks for an African student of mine!"
,hapozamani,2008-12-21T12:24Z,"awesome up, dude
in case anyone's interested, 'afrobeat' is a sound exemplified by west african, particularly nigerian,  musicians, namely fela kuti
the genre doesn't include most of the artists here
remember, africa is the biggest continent in the world, and it's incredibly diverse - it's music, as well!"
,driver76,2009-02-01T00:31Z,"""It's the joyous awakening of a continent from a colonial nightmare""

Bullshit.  lets not have the self hating white man bringing his own tormented, demented spineless soul in to music. 

This music was made by musicians, a universal language. As a musician my self I have performed in the studio with a number of African players and all without exception despise the politicization of their music, especially when description are written by white self hating liberals who have never stepped a foot in Africa.

Now that I have vented I will be off.

Thank You
