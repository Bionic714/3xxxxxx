,CSuk,2008-03-16T21:27Z,"Superb quality from the FXG team as always. Thankx guys/gals.

The cast sang the Beatles songs excellently but what a really boring film (IMHO I thought so). If you love musicals and you like/love the Beatles songs, your'e in for a treat. You will love it!."
,delcross,2008-03-16T21:40Z,"Great quality both audio and video
Thanks"
,cray1000,2008-03-23T05:22Z,"This is an amazing movie.  I am not even a huge beatles fan but the singing is so good and i was surprised when i read that the actors are actually doing all the singing. 

the story is also cool as it follows through the early happy sixties to the crazier end of the decade."
,rbaleksandar,2008-03-23T10:46Z,"Yep, the movie is cool :) 10x ;)"
,XxDeucexX,2008-03-24T03:02Z,"my mom said this was a great movie so im gonna check it out. pretty popular movie, and the soundtrack is rly popular as well."
,tinky_,2008-03-31T20:19Z,"Whats the deal here...
Piratebay says there are 1402 seeders bitcomet says theres 19 seeders.
I download around 20 kb/s when I should have at least 900 kb/s
and I upload quicker than I download... I dont understand, why is it like this?
and dont give me no shit comments because Im a noob that doesnÂ´t understand, thats just mean, please teach me how it works instead."
,Valle9,2008-04-04T23:04Z,"Fantastic movie not only if you like some surtain bands or actors. It's just whole arty and...really really good. Many famous people appearing now and tnen, good idea, good message and high quality too. Start using VLC if you're having troubles with sound and all... Movie is warmly recomended "
,artaud2005,2008-04-06T19:16Z,thanks. You're da man.
,chickndude728,2008-04-07T17:13Z,HELP! is there a way to have it without the subtitles? When I watched it after I put it on a DVD it gave me the option in the disk menu to have no subtitles and i chose that option and it STILL had them...
,d3athr1d3r,2008-04-14T18:36Z,Fuck this torrent!! I just got a letter from the MPAA regarding downloading this shit... Yeah the quality is great but nothing is worth being reported to the MPAA  SO FUCK YOU MOTHER FUCKERS!! DONT' DOWNLOAD THIS!!!
,the_truth_hurts,2008-04-27T19:03Z,"lol dude, the MPAA is bullshit.. haha dont worry about it, they cant really do anything to you unless you sell their property to someone they find out about. hahaha.. :P  pirate til i die!!"
,Olivaise,2008-04-29T02:51Z,"""Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality."""
,chinkeyed420,2008-04-30T03:27Z,Besides the first letter you get from the MPAA is basically just a warning.
,zademirage00,2008-04-30T17:51Z,"^^ What he said.  I got a letter a long time ago from my cable company about me getting caught by the MPAA.    First letter is just a warning.  They did shut off my internet tho for a couple days.

Good movie tho."
,azzllin,2008-05-06T02:02Z,"some people just cant help themselves eh!  d3athr1d3r try using something convincing to get the attention you seek, if your worried give them my id im sure they can track my home addy, you wouldn't come near a site like this if they had contacted you, idiot."
,greenroomgal,2008-05-07T00:25Z,"great movie, great torrent! thanks!"

nice 1 Kudo !

Thx for great uploads FXG ;)"
,theRealKarmine,2008-06-08T04:28Z,people only cry about MPAA on FXG torrents so far that ive seen. seems to me like they are just trying to ruin their reputation.  i dont this shit on anyone elses releases.  then again i bet the guy is also doing all his downloading on an ISP that loves to screw people.
,Bambi-Slam,2008-06-08T12:58Z,"d3athr1d3r, don't be a dumbass.  The MPA letter had nothing to do with THIS torrent.  The torrent is fine.  It is a random thing, blaming the torrent for your warning letter is just fucking ignorant."
,gfnzilla,2008-06-13T02:42Z,"Wow, the MPAA dosen't want me to have it? Better download it twice then."
,warren7675,2008-06-23T04:08Z,"Yo, dis movie is da bomb.  Niggas be singing and shit.  Its crazy.  Dat one dood was on acid!

,The_Fett_Man,2008-06-29T07:00Z,wow imagine that....possibly getting in trouble for illegal downloading......who would have thought.....fucking noobs acting suprised that the mpaa isn't happy about fantastic sites like this
,markustangring,2008-07-02T14:49Z,Thanks!
,SnoboarderTPOH,2008-07-24T01:16Z,"This movie is great.  I am not the type to like musicals, but I am down with the Beatles.  But this movie offers so much more in my opinion.  The music was just tied in.  This movie really shows some brief insight into what life was like for a young adult living in the mid-late 1960s in the U.S.  "
,courtneyyy27,2008-08-14T03:12Z,I absolutely love this movie.

,bowseroffun,2008-09-14T00:03Z,"lOL its funny i dl torrents at great speed seeders wise i connect to alot and i dl them and i run on my step dads Road runner buisiness Class Internet 1.6MB Max DL and bout 500 or so Upload on doubts and MPAA or even the cable company havent said crap bout the total sense i started pirating ""totaly downloaded    42GB"" so your internet company must be the in the section of USA ""i live in usa also :D"" but You must have an ISP that is stopping piracy and Scanning all data transferr Hence the warning if you get caught 2 more times by your ISP you will lose your ability to connect Internet to your house.
USE UTORRENT AND ""peerguardian maybe"" or the Ipfilter for utorrent its great will block alot of anti p2p IP's AND Make sure encription is on which will make it harder for Your isp to Discover what Your transferring."

,rhynotude,2009-01-08T10:45Z,"Yo,ho's not enough is mentioned 'bout pirates protecting themselves... to that end try Peer Guardian ( http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2 )and/or Block List Manager & ProtoWall ( http://www.bluetack.co.uk/forums/index.php?act=dscriptca&CODE=viewcat&cat_id=1 ) ??

,SrMLove,2012-05-28T03:38Z,"@ flclkris
if you think its gay ... keep it to yourself.. b/c it sound like homosexual discrimination. and i dont see how a movie with a plot containing a love story between a man and a women can be gay in anyway. its an amazing -one of a kind- movie with a beautiful story that perhaps is too sophisticated for your dense little brain. in essence your a tool."
,SrMLove,2012-05-28T03:39Z,good stuff FXG! ... top torrent for this movie on multiple sites.
,SrMLove,2012-05-28T03:46Z,"except bono... although he did a good job .... i still cant ever get past how big of a douche he is. he should never play anyone but himself b/c he does a disservice to any character he is playing b/c i cant look past his outer ""douchey"" self. i hate that guy. so much that words can not express....
but the movie is still so remarkable that not even bono himself can ruin it... and he ruins everything he comes in contact with. 
once again 
props to FXG!"
