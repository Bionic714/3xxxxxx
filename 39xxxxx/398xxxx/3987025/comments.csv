can you read?? 
If you dont understand that this is a DJ who has mixed his favourite trax then you may have a much larger problem than me. 

btw i see that dj friendly is a search term,
but i cant find much of it.. 
Real DJ`s plays on vinyl !

And DJ Friendly is a well known dj in Norway so fuck off
