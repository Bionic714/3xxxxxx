,Deadend_deadend,2008-02-27T22:46Z,"Thanks for this collection; nice to hear some of these tunes again, some for the first time. Downloaders note that these files are .m4a; this may be good to some (good file size, good sound quality) but bad for others (who may be using car stereos or other devices that do not recognize that format, but who would rather have it in mp3). Note that you can convert to mp3 on many standard applications (inlcuding iTunes), but that you will loose data and some sound quality as well. All that being said, thanks so much for offering this up. I will continue to seed. D-D"
,Krieschen,2008-03-11T19:12Z,Great job. I recently discovered Calexico. This group makes superb music. Thank you for your effort and for sharing.
,phisheadharpoon,2008-04-05T19:11Z,Unbelievable job putting this all together. Thanks!

great music! :D"
,Numskull808,2008-12-27T08:59Z,Thanks for the up on these. I've never complained about a torrent before but Calexico is one of my fave bands.  All 13 discs are ripped at 128kbps.  Which is equal to the quality of FM radio.  Seriously it does not do the band justice in the least.  I'm not bashing your efforts I just don't understand why anyone would rip anything at such a low bit rate it makes no sense.  I wanted to fill in a couple gaps mainly convict pool and I just feel like it was  pointless to DL this torrent.  Please don't take offense I do appreciate the effort just want the others to know it's  very low bit rate rip.
,kwstaskkkts,2010-03-22T13:35Z,Unfortunately the quality is very bad similar to 128kbps. It is tolerable only for those that listen through cheap PC speakers. It would be pleasant if someone re-make this work from the original WAV files but in 320kbps mp3 (algorithm with the least losses and the lightest psychoacoustic add-ons)
,TraumaHound,2011-03-24T03:34Z,"Just downloading ""Convict Pool"" for their cover of ""Alone Again Or"" after hearing it in a Starbucks today. Awesome song, great cover. Thanks for sharing!"
,PieChaser,2011-09-03T17:23Z,"Thanks for the great torrent, Calexico is wonderful!

Also, do'nt forget that this is not in MP3 format but in AAC format.
128kbps AAC format sounds much, much better than 128 kbps MP3 format, you can in no way compare the audioquality between 128kbps AAC and 128kbps MP3, wouldn't be fair"
