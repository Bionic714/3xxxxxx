So the story goes, King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) and his people are being terrorized by the horrific monster Grendel (Crispin Glover). 
Hrothgar puts out a call to any brave man who can come and slay the monster. 
Enter Beowulf (Ray Winstone) and his brave band of soldiers. Beowulf is a mighty warrior, and he quickly dispatches Grendel, but in doing so he enrages Grendel's mother--played here by an extremely sexy and serpentine Angelina Jolie. 
Beowulf journeys out to lay waste to Grendel's mother as well, but soon finds his resolve tested by great temptation. 
His choice ultimately brings about a new curse--one far worse than Grendel. Groundbreaking animation, stunning visuals, and a talented cast.

Cast: Ray Winstone, Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, Robin Wright Penn, Crispin Glover.
