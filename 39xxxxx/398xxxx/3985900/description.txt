Stranger in the House

The crime drama is about an insurance investigator named Ben Ford who works 
the border in both Detroit and Windsor. The story takes into account the 
shifting allegiances and ambitions that straddle the Detroit/Windsor 
Canada/US border.

Benjamin Ford's 30th birthday happens to fall on a fateful day: November 22, 
1963, the day of the Kennedy assassination. Coincidentally, it is also the 
day that his flight attendant girlfriend, Katie, disappears on a flight back 
from Dallas.

The mystery of what happened to her, and why, consumes the life of Ben Ford; 
it eventually involves his adult daughter, Kathleen, when Katie's body turns 
up 40 years later. Family mysteries and intrigue play out against a 
spectacular backdrop of some of the more momentous events of recent American 
and Canadian history.
