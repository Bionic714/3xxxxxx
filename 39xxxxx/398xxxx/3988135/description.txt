QUATERMASS biography
Power trio of keyboard, bass and drums. Straddling the line between hard rock and prog, there's a little something here to appease fans of both styles. Keyboards apparently just piano and organ, with the latter being especially hot-wired to make the keyboardist's style resemble Frumpy keyboardist Jean-Jacques KRAVETZ, or perhaps Dave STEWART at his most maniacal (see "Dreams Wide Awake" for an example). He can lash out at his organ with a recklessness that puts EMERSON to shame, listen to the solo on "Post War, Saturday Echo" if you don't believe me. Bass player John GUSTAFSON (pre-ROXY MUSIC) sings in a uncontrolled, manic voice that can often sound gut-wrenching. A couple of tracks (the ballad "Good Lord Knows" and the lengthy jam-orientated "Laughin' Tackle" include massed strings. In the 90s there suddenly was a QUATERMASS II, but their music seems to have very little to do with the original band. The latest CD is called "The Long Road"
