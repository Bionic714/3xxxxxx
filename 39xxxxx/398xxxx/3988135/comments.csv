Even though the name is the same,this Quatermass has NOTHING to do with the excellent first album of that same name (with the exception of Mr. Underwood on drums). whereas the first one was solid laidback prog...i almost said....usual trio Bass,Keys and drums. This one comes across as a lost powerrock groups last gasp!! Shame on you guys!! Guest star Don Airey on keyboards cannot save this... and Nick Simper (first bass.player with Deep Purple way back..later he formed WARHORSE) cant save the day...this is at best AOR rock...with little to give us progfreaks. Sure, there are good guitaring and nice vocals,but there is nothing that we havent heard before!!How on earth could you (in your wildest imagination) call yourself Quatermass ( even if you attached a II )??? So guys and gals...go for Quatermass the original...this one´s a waste of time!!! Originally i started out with a 2 star rating,but...the more i hear the more i am certain that this only deserves 1 star !! And hey..there´s is nothing wrong with powerrock/AOR rock...but then you really should check out Nick Simper´s FANDANGO or WARHORSE instead...much better value for your hard earned music flavour !!"
