I have these cds, but for some reason when I put it in my computer to burn, the tracks get all jumbled up, and I just don't burn it because I don't know if they're go back how they're supposed to or not.  I don't know, but I'm glad to have it now!  I was front row to one of their concerts when I was in high school, very fun!"
