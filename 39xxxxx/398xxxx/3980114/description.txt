This is stripped down hate doom, very much akin to their late Chicago brethren Buried at Sea or Portland, Maine's Ocean. (stonerrock),

Slights and Abuse is 28 minutes long?a full-length by many bands? standards?but it?s really only half an album. A companion LP, Sycophant, is due out in February, and Seventh Rule plans to release both on a single CD around the same time. Sycophant will invert the theme of Slights to focus on serving oneself instead of a larger social organism, echoing ideas from Nietzche and LaVey that many a metalhead has found inspirational.
