  NOTES:
    
    Restless is a short film documenting the last two years 
    of the etnies team travels, their skateboarding and 
    everything in between. From Arizona to Mallorca to 
    Helsinki, Copenhagen and back home, Restless is about 
    friends, fun, and seeing the world through skateboarding.

    In addition to impeccable talent on a skateboard, our 
    riders have a wide range of background, dynamic styles, 
    voices and personalities that we choose to embrace.
    Arto Saari, Ryan Sheckler, Jason Dill, Rune Glifberg, 
    Ali Boulala, Ronnie Creager, Elissa Steamer, Kyle Leeper, 
    Eric Fletcher, Conhuir Lynn, and our European team are 
    skateboarding and they are etnies.
