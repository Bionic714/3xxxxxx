Here is a selection of some of the best-known and best-loved tales of 
The Arabian Nights, including "Sinbad," "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves," 
"Aladdin," "The Talking Bird," and the "Fisherman and the Genie." In 
this "treasure house of pleasant things" you will find golden palaces, 
gem studded caves, and breathtaking gardens; you will sit by mysterious 
fountains, hear the crash of gleaming waterfalls, unearth magic lamps, 
take a long voyage to exotic shores, and meet flying men and mythical 
beasts. 

Nowhere else will you find such marvels, nowhere else will you find 
the impossible so real and convincing. For centuries The Arabian Nights 
has enchanted readers. These stories are presented here in a clear and 
direct style that renders them as fresh and as exciting as when they 
were first told.
