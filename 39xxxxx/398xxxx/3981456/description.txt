Hi there!

I got an idea to put some of my MP3's to share, there ain't any of them number one to me, depends
to feelings etc, you know that yourself too, right?

So here is my harder style TOP 50, some of these are older, and some a bit newer, hope you all enjoy :)

If so, maybe i'll put some other music together, like TOP 50 Trance, TOP 50 Chill trance,
TOP 50 Happy Hardcore, TOP 50 Dance and TOP 50 Pop/Dancefloor or something :)
