[M],Q91,2008-01-17T14:42Z,I'd like to see that TOP50 Happy Hardcore... Somehow I know it's going to be only dutch happy hardcore
,Damjam,2008-01-17T14:52Z,"Well, i think most of them is, but there's also soma UK's DJ's, like Dougal & Gammer also. I haven't think about that yet through, but there is older and newer song's like this one here."
[M],Q91,2008-01-17T14:57Z,"Dougal & Gammer are actually UK Hardcore (or just  Hardcore in britain). Dougal used to make Happy Hardcore, but as it died in the UK around 99, it changed to what it is today"
,Damjam,2008-01-17T15:06Z,"Yeah, you're right, but i don't take too seriously what is hardcore and happy hardcore if we come to that, don't know if there's a problem with someone else, is it German hardcore or UK hardcore, i only hope everyone enjoy. But i have to say that you're just right and if i'm not wrong, it ain't chanced."
