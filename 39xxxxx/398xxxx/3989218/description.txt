The ultimate (at least until the next one comes out) collection of Superman's post-crisis adventures.  Includes all main Superman titles from 1986 on, including Superman's adventures with the Justice League.  Also included, the adventures of Superboy, Steel, the Eradicator and all 3 Supergirls, including their appearances with Young Justice, the Teen Titans, the New Titans and the Outsiders.  Thoroughly researched and placed in chronological order.  Dl what you need or grab the whole thing (I will try and keep it seeded for as long as possible).  Enjoy!

This is Part 1, covering Superman's pre-history, Year One, various standing pre-Crisis stories and then the on-going post-Crisis books from Adventures of Superman 424, Superman v1 1 and Action Comics 584, up until roughly 8/90 (Adventures of Superman 469, Superman v2 46 and Action Comics 655).
