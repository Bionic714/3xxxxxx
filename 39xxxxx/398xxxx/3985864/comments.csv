i will have additional seeds on monday.  should take no longer than 5 days to get it fully spread."
,Bamimi,2008-01-20T08:22Z,you should of seperated it into smaller batches then upped each batch in sequence. zips is just not a good idea on this sort of thing.
,sk8er2571,2008-01-20T18:33Z,"dont listen to these chumps, you did a great job."
,telos,2008-01-21T03:55Z,"There are already 3 seeders and I'm pumping 120KBs into this thing so I don't see why people are complaining. 

By the end of the week it should be very well distributed. "
,TheKogut,2008-01-24T00:53Z,"Just be patient, kids. We're all sitting on this thing, and soon enough it will get distributed. Wired is running the story, so it shouldn't be long before even more people jump on this."

,HPDarkness,2008-01-25T22:04Z,"I think it's funny. People think their images will be safe online if they make it private on Myspace.

,Jays4Life,2008-01-26T04:59Z,PLEASE SEED!!!!!!!
,blaine00,2008-01-26T05:12Z,"I hope this thing has been fully seeded out. Of all my peers, the highest ratio downloaded is %77.6. I will be pissed if I find out that no one is seeding the entire %100.

Thanks a lot for posting twdmaul! This should be... interesting to say the least."
,rHBa,2008-01-26T07:11Z,"Looks like the torrent is split into 17x1gb zip files (rather than 1 big zip file).

Also there is a zip file of HTML pages with images pulled straight off myspacecdn.com"

,germversion,2008-01-26T13:05Z,downloading this epicness of a torrent -- had its own news article Good work Maul! 
[M],DeeLee,2008-01-26T14:12Z,seeds are correct but leechers is wrong. It currently have 6185 leechers.
,blaine00,2008-01-26T15:40Z,"Okay guys, I've already download the HTML part and I've been going through it... and one thing I have found about Myspace people is that they don't really hide interesting pictures... I haven't really found anything worth mentioning...

When I finally get one of the picture parts I'll be able to browse much faster."
,fasps,2008-01-26T16:25Z,"Eh, this download is BS so far.

1. I'm halfway through looking at 0.zip, which contains 32,000 pics, and not one nude has been found.

2. There's no labels whatsoever on these pics, so we can't even tell what account they came from.

Really, it's just a bunch of crappy pics and is no different than scanning google image search using random words."

HTML files, douchenozzle."
,LondonOntGuy,2008-01-26T18:58Z,"
OMG, Pedobear! Run Pedobear! Chris Hansen is gonna come for you soon!

First zip in the pack is complete fail. Takes forever to load, even on my 3.5 Ghz AMD. ACDSee basically pukes up because it can't handle that many pics, but I'm more convinced that it can't handle so much fail in one folder.

,delton19,2008-01-26T20:15Z,"Use WinRAR everyone! 

Also, I think a lot of people are downloading this just out of disgust at Myspace. 

Really, its hard to find interesting stuff here. Probably only 1 out of 100 pics are interesting, and only 1 out of 500 are nude, although I didn't find any nudes in a search of like 50, these are just random estimates. Still, theres like 32000 pics in each folder. Hopefully people will start releasing best of torrents soon. "
,paine1214,2008-01-27T03:07Z,i dont understand y would anyone want 2 DL this???
,blaine00,2008-01-27T15:10Z,"Yeah, I started going through the first zip file and I've only found 1 nude...

LondonOntGuy, it is not your computer that can't handle that many pictures, it is your OS. Trying going with an operating system that doesn't suck as bad as Windows.

I'm in Mac OS X 10.5 and everything is working fine so far.

Yes, I am now only downloading this to spite Myspace. I can see this is going to be half a million pieces of crap. But I'd like to go ahead and get it so I can help seed it out... to the people that are going to download it no matter what comments they read."
,ciupi,2008-01-28T06:09Z,whats inside ?
,chrisnolan81,2008-01-28T07:57Z,"This is complete bullshit.  I scanned through over 60,000 pictures, and there was NOT ONE INTERESTING ONE.  There were *maybe* 4 or 5 pics of topless professional models ripped from places like Suicide Girls.  I think this whole thing is a complete scam -- these are nothing more than the public pictures.  Lots of them are repeated in different archives.  There's nothing here you wouldn't show your grandma.

I think we've all been suckered into downloading 17 MB of bullshit."

,The_Real_Clipper,2008-01-28T15:17Z,"Pfff I just browsed the html files a bit. Wedding, baby, party, wedding, baby, party, etc.

True boring stuff. Anyone has that porn image recognition software ? that would help a lot :-P

Some dudes on myspace have hundreds of horrible ugly pictures of pretty much anything including numerous times their stupid face in all positions and expressions. At least today they eventually will have ""friends "" that will look at their pictures (even thoug it wasn't wanted) :-D"
