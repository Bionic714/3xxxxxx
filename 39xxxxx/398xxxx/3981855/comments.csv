,steve10,2008-01-19T09:57Z,sorry for the time this is taking...my upload speed is slower than a ..pensioner driving a nissan micra on sunday...
,MIKEYPROS,2008-02-03T07:26Z,"this is missing the VTS_01_1.VOB file, thanks  "
,FUCK_OFF_WEASEL,2008-02-08T05:57Z,"The movie is watchable on Nero Showtime, played from the hard drive. Without the VTS_01_1.VOB file, it will not burn to DVD. No software that I know of can repair the movie to burn it to DVD. Oh well, I'll keep looking..........."
,FUCK_OFF_WEASEL,2008-02-08T06:43Z,"If you can't burn the movie, try this: In the Hannah Montana folder, copy ""VIDEO_TS.VOB"" to your desktop, rename it ""VTS_01_1.VOB"", copy the renamed file and put it back in the Hannah Montana folder. Use DVDFab Platinum (get this one, it does not need a key or crack: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3909412/DVDFab.Platinum.v4.0.1.2.Cracked-F4CG ) to re-encode the DVD file (it needs to be fixed, so get DVDFab). In DVDFab, under ""Customize"", choose titles 1,8 and 9, dump the rest (unless you want to keep an audition out take, the previews and a DVD piracy warning), and then choose to either write the movie to hard drive or burn to DVD disc. I chose to save the movie to hard drive so I can save it for later burning. Hope that helps, and thanks to the uploader for the movie. "
