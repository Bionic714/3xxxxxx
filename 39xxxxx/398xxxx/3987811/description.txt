Lark Rise to Candleford is a love letter to a vanished corner of rural England and a heart-warming drama series teeming with wit, wisdom and romance. Dawn French, Julia Sawalha and Liz Smith star in a ten-part adaptation of Flora Thompson's magical memoir of her Oxfordshire childhood.

Set in the small hamlet of Lark Rise and the wealthier neighbouring market town, Candleford, the series chronicles the daily lives of farm-workers, craftsmen and gentry at the end of the 19th Century.

This world is seen through the eyes of a teenage girl, Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan - Sugar Rush, Torchwood) as she leaves Lark Rise to start a new life under the wing of the independent and effervescent Dorcas Lane (Julia Sawalha - Hornblower, Pride And Prejudice) who is post-mistress at the local post office in Candleford.
