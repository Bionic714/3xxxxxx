,PsychopathicMetal08,2008-05-05T17:03Z,"mr smart-ass wrestling is scripted guy.... yeah its scripted and its also FAKE you dumbass... its fake because they use blades to cut themselves (thats how wrestlers actually bleed) and they train for years so they dont get hurt for real.... most the ""injuries"" are also fake and only real if caused by accident

any inteligent wrestling fan should know that.... and the same rules apply for every single wrestling promotion, its all FAKE."

[T],FaeGiN,2008-06-14T10:08Z,"hehe the debate continues....
'is Wrestling Fake?'
That isn't a valid argument.
Wrestling is pantomime, theatrical play.
It is definitely not fake pantomime so the answer is NO it is not fake.
If the question was - 'Is Wrestling REAL fighting?' then anyone can see and learn that of course it is NOT real fighting!
In that case the answer would be that it is FAKE fighting!"

,coenieic,2011-02-24T09:10Z,Look I used to think wrestling was fake myself UNTIL I stepped into the ring and decided to try it for myself. And I can tell you right now - that shit hurts!! And if there are any of you out there that thinks its fake then grow a set of balls and step into the ring and I bet your attitude will change REAL fast.
