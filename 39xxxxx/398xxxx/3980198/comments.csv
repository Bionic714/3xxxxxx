This app tells you everything you need to know about your system without even cracking the case, right down to the processor's serial number. 

Fantastic Upload!!! Plan to seed on a permanent basis!! 

Thanks a Million!!"

,DocEvil,2008-08-13T06:55Z,"I cannot express how awesome this is in words. You, with a single program, have completely outdone the information provided by any tech-help site I've used, including the chat and phone conversations from the manufacturer. NOBODY could tell me what RAM, Processor or Motherboard I have.
Again, thankyou. This is a KICKASS program!"
,DocEvil,2008-08-13T06:56Z,"Allthough....if they could list the PIN of the RAM, that'd be nice. But its still amazing."

,ButchTheButcher,2008-11-27T16:21Z,"Somebody here can help me?
I have 4 Gb RAM Kingston DDR2 800 (NOT HyperX) with CL5 (5-5-5-18) @ 1.8V
I overclock my CPU
Athlon 5400+ 2.8Gb @ 3.15Gb (225 x 14)
HT Link down @ 900 HHz
The RAM work @ 450 MHz, VDIMM 1.8V.
I buy Memory heatspreaders and i ll try to rise tne VDIMM @ 2.0 - 2.1V.
The question is : Can I get timmings 4-4-4-12 in this type of memory (if it's possibe). I think that I can rise the RAM freq. @ 460HHz with 2.0V.
So It's possible run a CL5 memory 5-5-5-18 @ 4-4-4-12 and how?
Thanks."

Can not be. The program in upx was have in original a while ago some problems with AV scanners. See them forums.
to be sure use innounp extracts the installer, scan single files online. Its possible you have any viri on pc and it hangs on every process what you start. Check if your nod got the right updates (if its patched and use suspiciouse av update server it could be nod by self)

I will check if the software what i use by self is infected and will not upload it."
