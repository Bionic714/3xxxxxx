http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3999229/aaf-crwdd.s01e03.avi

It is only my second u/l, so I somehow screwed up in naming it, and I'm not sure if it will show up in searches. Sorry for the inconvenience."
,Kronz,2008-01-29T21:08Z,"your upload works fine, it just indexed the torrent by the file name rather than the name the release group gave it.  thanks for helping out, it's a great show and I don't get Vh1!"
,DaisyB,2008-02-01T21:34Z,"Thank you so much, great show, looking forward to episiode 4!"
