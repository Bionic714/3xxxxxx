,apowell0224,2008-01-18T03:57Z,"No prob at all... the first of this iso didnt work, and i made the mistake of uploading without testing fully"
,chops3,2008-01-18T04:57Z,how about seeding this.
,TheScynic,2008-01-18T05:10Z,"Appreciate the re-do, apowell0224.  :-]"
,carlosrajas,2008-01-18T10:53Z,more seeders please !....we're maniacs
,apowell0224,2008-01-18T14:02Z,"Because of the strict parential restrictions in my household, i can only seed for certain times...but dont worry ill be seeding all day today. Quit worrying the download will eventually be finished."
,apowell0224,2008-01-18T14:04Z,And make sure you let me know how the iso turns out when its done TheScynic
,apowell0224,2008-01-19T08:16Z,"In the previous version of this iso i included a note that norton antivirus 2007 detected a virus in chapter 10... and there is a simple solution to these 12 viruses that were found by richard4988

just dont use these components of the cd image...

I suggest before attempting to install any software, first virus scan the item to ensure there is no traces of viruses

(and just a comment...the most probable reason your anti virus software detected 12 viruses was because there is an entire chapter dedicated to password cracking.... they were probably just the keyloggers)"
,apowell0224,2008-01-19T08:18Z,"And i can personally assure you that this iso is an exact image of the CD that came with steal this computer book 4.0 with no modifications or additions to the software it contains

But other than the complaint, i'm glad to see that my first torrent is successful"
,crump,2008-01-19T10:49Z,Sweet
,Pauper,2008-01-21T16:09Z,"Ya .. he ""Fixed"" it alright ...
The fake_freeav.exe in Chapter 05 - Trojan Horses and Worms\fake_freeav.zip contains the Generic.HSN Trojan Horse,
and the KReview.exe found in H:\Chapter 09 - Cracking Passwords\kreview.zip contains the Agent.LJR Trojan Horse.
*** DO NOT DOWNLOAD ***
To apowell0224 I have this to say: ""Fuck off and die squealing shithead"""
,apowell0224,2008-01-21T19:13Z,"I dont really like to call some people retards but, Pauper....you insignificant little piece of shit, i said DO NOT USE ANY PROGRAMS THAT YOUR VIRUS SCAN SOFTWARE SAYS CONTAIN VIRUSES OR TORJAN HORSES....

if your not happy with the torrent...then dont use it. But you have to understand that i did not create the programs, however i do use them on my computer.

And Honestly i don't know the first thing about making viruses.....let alone adding them to the iso....

Oh and one more thing Pauper.... Suck My Dick"
,Nanoer11,2008-02-08T04:52Z,"To whoever thinks it has viruses in it. No shit sherlock. Note how the whole book is about hacking a computer and since this is the software that goes with it makes sense that it would contain viruses, trojans, keyloggers and so on which of course your antivirus program would detect. >_> "
,apowell0224,2008-02-16T06:10Z,"Finally someone understands the whole concept of ""steal this computer book 4.0"" thanks nanoer11"
,Nanoer11,2008-02-18T21:25Z,By the way do you happen to have the ebook to go with the cd? I tried looking for it but I could only find older versions not 4.0. Thanks. 
,apowell0224,2008-02-20T03:19Z,"I dont have the eBook, but ill look around, if i do find it, ill be sure to make a torrent."
,Speaker4TheDead,2009-05-31T11:00Z,"Thanx apowell0224,
Now let's hope I can make use of this w/out killing my comp ;)"
,AbganExplor3r,2009-12-13T10:38Z,"Apowell0224, 

So far I have not encountered any program that will allow you to 'skip' so to speak of the chapters included with the malware in them.

In my opinion, I think the CD should have come in a regular file directory so one could choose the chapters to download. Makes it much easier to SKIP the crap that you recommend not to downoad.

If anyone finds a program that can see the actual files inside the .iso file and extract them individually, then please post a comment about it.

,vim123,2010-01-29T23:39Z,"Where is the 4.0 ebook, why isn't it included in the torrent?"
,tomasz5,2010-06-15T00:03Z,"usrnme, the files are 100% clean don't worry! But if your still paranoid use winrar to extract the files you want
