Fixed copy of the Freeware Cd that comes with "Steal This Computer Book 4.0"

I loved this CD so much i felt everyone should have a copy without having to pay $30 for the book

I previously made a torrent that was unreadable, however i did not find this out until after it was created, so this is the fixed version.
