Not sure without more info.
Have the other avi's worked ok?
If your player is DivX compatible, then playing should be fine.
But...if all else fails, you could use something like ConvertXtoDVD software to create a DVD format, which won't have any compatibility issues with your system.

I use a Home Theatre Computer (HTPC) so don't have compatibility issues, hence don't have experience with how to overcome your particular problem."

Crap download - A/V out of sync and video out of proportion (squashed)

Why has no-one written about this?

Have tried in mulpiple players all with correct codecs...

WHY HAS NO-ONE MENTIONED THIS?  ARE YOU ALL IDIOTS?

What a waste of 1.8 GB dl"

Thanks Cody1970!"
