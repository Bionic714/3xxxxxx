Then Apple's next operating system called ""The Beast"" will natively run on all computers and all Windows and Mac software will merge to work on it. That's the same time the Intel 50 core chip will come out. The Beast 10.6.b66, the good thing is that it will be the end of viruses, but more spyware backed by homeland security."
,Jadocs,2008-01-19T22:26Z,"BS, Think about it.  All the viruses you see on PCs are written to attack Windows.  So if there is only going to be one OS, guess what type of viruses your going to be seeing Moron."
,hockpooh,2008-01-20T01:53Z,"You kiss your Mother with those lips.

Mac Viruses can't be made, that's why we don't have them. Duh.

We would have them with or without windows if they were easy to make.

Windows is an inferior product, always was, always will be.

Apple had the best OS that's what pissed Gates off, cause Jobs was one up on him."
,Jadocs,2008-01-20T02:57Z,How old are you 15?  The reason we don't have Mac viruses is because the majority of people use Windows and it is much easier to attack that OS.  So if you think it would be the end of viruses if Apple bought out MS resulting in one common OS for everyone you are a moron. I bet you think gun control reduces crime too. 
,hockpooh,2008-01-20T03:34Z,"I have boxer shorts older then you son.

52 year old Grand Father of 4. I'm not going to waste my time educating you. I said it was going to be the end of viruses, because safe guards will be in place to prevent them from being implemented in the first place. Trust me, I have friends high up in Government, Law, and Tech companies. I know what I'm talking about. That's the advantages of being a senior citizen and being there when the birth of all that you know was started, some companies were started by high school friends of mine, like Intel."
,Jadocs,2008-01-20T04:21Z,"Ok, we both made incorrect assumptions about age. I still disagree with your claim."
,drumheadz,2008-01-21T02:29Z,Period... !! ; ))
,hockpooh,2008-01-21T03:14Z,"Why would you want to write viruses ? Do you like hurting others ? Are you a thief ? Are you evil ? I find that being kind to kind people is so much more fulfilling and stomping out evil demons has it's own pleasures. If you want to hurt the government and over throw it pick up a weapon and stand and face your enemy like a man. It's our right to a new form of government or so they said, where do you vote on that, no where ??? then that leaves only one choice."

I would have to say that you are right,
about viruses. Since the OS X kernel source code
is free to have a copy of. You can look for weaknesses in the code. And make a virus for it.

The things that people are saying about OSX is.
Nothing more that apple hype. Any and every OS  
Not only can be hacked but can also be infected.

People where saying the same thing about Linux.
and they where all wrong VLAD is I remember right made the first virus for Linux.

So to say that Apple OS X is better than Windows 
when it comes to viruses is full of it.

Since OpenStep 4.2 had problems with some Kernel code and if you look at the kernel source for darwin, xnu-1228.3.13.
You will find the same errors in the kernel.
So to say that OS X is the best of the best.
And can not be hacked you surly are wrong.
And have not done your home work.
I can be sure hockpooh, that I have been using PC's for a lot longer than you have.
Trs 80 was the first system that I had.
And I have a lot of Unix know how.
Linux, BSD (before FreeBSD came out),
NextStep 3.3 ( Now Apple OS X),
OpenStep 4.2 ( Now Apple OS X),
Windows All versions from dos 3.21 to 
Windows Vista.
So as you can see I might have more know how
Than you."
,m0dzyz,2008-04-09T03:13Z,Oh I forgot Mac OS X 10.1 to 10.5 PPC And Intel.
