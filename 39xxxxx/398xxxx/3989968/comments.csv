,Rbarba23,2008-03-28T18:50Z,"Here is the deal on this torrent. As you can tell by the resolution, it is a full screen video, I don't know if a widescreen exists or if it was filmed in widescreen, but for those using a widescreen monitor, it doesn't look too great. Also note that this is NOT an HD file. The quality is as stated, just about DVD quality, a little lower if you ask me. I found the audio to be delayed at parts, but not by much, it's totally acceptable and catches up after say 10 seconds. I have not checked to see if this movie is available in a different encode, but this was still very enjoyable to watch on my PC. I wouldn't advise making a DVD with it. To the uploader and/or encoder, don't take this as a diss, just want people to have an idea of what they are getting as it is listed in the high def section. I wasn't expecting too much out of this movie as a film and in the end I was actually impressed and somewhat enjoyed it. Still doesn't beat Disney though, but it is totally different. Enjoy the film, and remember to seed!"

,ray1987,2012-05-10T01:10Z,"This is in regard of Rbarba23's comment. Please get your facts right before you diss someones up load! When you say it's not a diss it really is, but any way on the remark of the Disney version being better. Well in the 1967 cartoon and the live action 1994 film are in fact both Disney.  Just thought you would like to know. By the way this is NOT a diss just a correction for the miss informed."
