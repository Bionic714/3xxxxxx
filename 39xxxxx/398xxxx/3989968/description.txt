Born of Men.  Raised by Animals.  Destined for Danger.

A spectacular, heart-stopping adventure based on Rudyard Kipling's classic tale of India under the British Raj.  The Jungle Book tells the exhilarating story of Mowgli, a boy raised by wolves and who befriends the wild animals of the jungle, with the exception of the most dangerous, Khan the tiger; and who holds the key to finding a lost city filled with untold treasures.

...this is a journey you shouldn't miss taking.

A Solid Version Of The Classic Story, 11 July 2006
Author: ccthemovieman-1 from Lockport, NY, United States 

This was pretty solid adventure story with colorful backgrounds of a the country of India and jungle scenery. 

Jason Scott Lee as "Mowgli" is interesting to watch in the lead. Lee is an intriguing actor. He has an Asian background, but has played an Eskimo, here in Indian and other nationalities in other films. He is one of the more diverse actors I've ever seen, yet he isn't well-known.

Cary Elwes is usually effective as a villain. He has the acting talent that makes him easy to despise! The animals are fun, too, from Mowgli's friends in the jungle to the monkeys and giant snake guarding the lost caves with the treasure. Nicely filmed and a good adventure story for everyone.
