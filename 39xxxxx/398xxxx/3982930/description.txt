Episode 13 The blizzard makers

In blizzard-wracked Florida, Nelson contacts a meteorologist who may be able to help explain the strange weather conditions. That night, however, the scientist is abducted, and "programmed" to kill Nelson. When his first attempt fails, he comes aboard Seaview when she sails to investigate the source of the problem, and continues his efforts.
