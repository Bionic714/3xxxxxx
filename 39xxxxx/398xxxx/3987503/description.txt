R.C. Cars is a fun little off-road racing game that puts you in control of three different RC Cars: a Bigfoot-style truck, a six-wheeled Hummer and a racecar. Race over many different types of terrain, from beaches to busy roads. During each race, you may come across people, animals, cars, and a variety of other obstacles. Since life doesn't stop for your races, you'll need boost and jump abilities to maneuver around the obstacles in each track. In Championship mode, you can win prize money, which you can use to purchase car upgrades and unlock other tracks. Use shortcuts hidden in each track to overtake your opponents and finish first.

Features:
- Two-player split screen mode
- LAN play (up to six players)
- Ghost Race (race against your own best result)
- Magnificent racing physics
