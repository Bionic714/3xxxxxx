 /Applications/Utilities/SteerMouse.app/Contents/Resources/SteerMouse Manager.app

Directly into Little Snitch. Seems to work for me... so fa at least. Can't guarantee that it works for good though."
,spankbot,2008-01-31T07:36Z,Simply going to your Applications/Utilities folder and launching Steermouse will re-enable it for a while.

Actually, Steermouse was my very first app that i purchase a license for. I got so fuckin' mad everytime when i had to restart the app. 
It cost me less than 20$, ant it was really worth it. The reason why i purchased a license was because of that message that came up when i gave in a cracked key: ""Your key is cracked, but i am a nice person so i will let it go, but if you want to be a nice person purchase the software..."" or somthing like that
That is humour guys, worth paying for."
