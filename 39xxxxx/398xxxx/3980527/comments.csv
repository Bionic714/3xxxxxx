,cdrobinson83,2008-01-17T21:29Z,"Toast won't recognize the .cue file in this RAR.  i'm sure it may just be my copy of toast or something.  but does anyone have any suggestions?  if you got it to work, could you help me out a bit? thanks."
,Bishopbush,2008-01-29T06:15Z,I don't know why people do the files like this because I don't know anything about how to separate the files aren't in one file. 
,ashasaur,2008-02-17T02:31Z,"mkay folks, while the jackass who ripped this apparently doesnt know how to use a simple program called WINDOWS FUCKING MEDIA PLAYER to rip CDs to individual tracks, but here is an annoying solution to this rip(IE, to make different tracks)

1-Right click on the .CUE file, the select Open With, and then hit Wordpad, that will open the CUE file and let you see when the tracks end, you can simply then use a audio file splitting program(Such as WavePad, google for a cracked version)and split the file at the correct locations and voila!  A CORRECT release, OR wait for about an hour or so and let me do it, and I will re-release this here at TPB."
