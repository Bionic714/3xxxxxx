,jimbo1st,2008-01-23T11:38Z,Had problem with no sound on RealPlayer. Used WMA and got sound. Then used Nero player and got sound. Works great now. Tried again with RealPlayer and now that has got sound. 
,xxhaz07xx,2008-01-26T00:44Z,whats the point in seeding this klaxxon. crap old movie which is on the tv all the time.
,hyteck,2008-01-26T11:34Z,for all the blind ppl Klaxxon has aXXo in it in case you cant see it kl aXXo n im not sure if they are aXXo but maybe
,Dealer_,2008-01-26T22:12Z,Klaxxon who are u?? made good videos anyway :)
,rapemaster,2008-01-28T16:18Z,For all of you who complains about KLAXXON releasing avp1: Maybe some people haven't seen it yet and would be happy to download it so they could see it before eventually going to the theaters to see avp2? Stop complaining and just don't download it if you've seen it before...
,projektdeth,2008-01-28T18:35Z,KLAXXON smokes cock.  He releases torrents that are already available and attaches his gay-ass name to them.  DIE KLAXXON
,stormenper,2008-01-30T11:47Z,This is the first movie!! ATTENTION: NOT AvP2!!
,right2copy1,2008-01-30T18:15Z,"if it is axxo welcome back

,leannenude,2008-04-21T00:12Z,"Thanks for posting AvP 1, I've been trying to find it before I see 2!"
,catchow58,2008-04-27T08:31Z,"I've just discovered KLAXXON, but it looks like he's doing a great job, even if some of the the torrents were previously available.  He's bringing together some high quality product.  Because he's got a following, these movies are all thoroughly and dependably seeded, and his blog is fun to read.  I intend to start leaving comments.

Rock on, KLAXXON!"
,An4h0ny,2008-05-17T19:07Z,"thx.  i was looking for avp1.  hard to find a good, fast tor of this now.  much obliged."
,jbb1979,2008-10-05T13:18Z,"Thx Klaxxon this was on tv last night and I could have recorded it to my harddrive, but then I'd have to convert it to MP4 or something, that would take hours and hours on my system..

This way, I get what I could legally have taped of the tv onto my computer, without wasting time and global resources on converting it myself.

Thank you very much. By the way, I look at the movies that are on each night, most nights there are two or three good ones these days, and I download them and see them in the morning. That way I can do more interesting things at night, where I am more into exercising and so, so tv doesn't get in the way.

And again, it saves time and energy resources, so great service, keep up the good work. I think I'll have to get Lord of the Rings next, it's on tv every Christmas.

God bless you, people need to realize how legal this is.

Thanks,

Jesper from Denmark"
,kidknapp,2009-03-31T23:10Z,"I just HAD to say something.... First - Klaxxon - Thank You. I personally appreciate this torrent because its not so easy to find a DVD hard copy at many stores anymore, and I don't have ultra package cable like these other kids living in their Mom's basement who can whine about replayed movies being uploaded on TPB...WHich brings me to, Second-  xxhaz07xx and projektdeth - You are the sucky cock-smokers - Neither of you have even uploaded any torrents of your own - WTF? You like to leech but don't wanna share your own? And then are stupid enough to disrespect somebody's torrent. You are bitches, and probably still suck your mother's teets while thumbing on your PSP's. Prolly couldn't even make yourselves Chef Boyardee if you were starving. Sorry everyone, and again, Thanx For the Up! "
,Revanant,2009-06-18T23:51Z,Great torrent! A/V is good quality and in sync. Thanks!
,.tpb-dude.,2009-07-04T14:05Z,"Hard to find a good copy... 
Thanks for the upload !"
,manny59,2009-12-28T17:06Z,"Sound only in VLC, no sound in other players. Can anyone pls upload The Spanish Woman (La Sagnola)."
,Damsco,2010-03-09T17:50Z,"nice quality
10/10"
,aiman9,2010-03-15T10:15Z,catchcow58 you're the good guy and thanks for saying that 
,lilkiss,2010-11-22T08:10Z,much appreciated! alwayz gud KLAXXON
,xxvi,2012-03-14T02:31Z,some torrents have no comments. You have 34. What more need I say. Your ID has been to me of great quality and generosity. Thank you always
,xxvi,2012-03-27T03:48Z,Thanks as always. Not too excited by the quality but it was off TV anyway and smaller file size. Does not in anyway detract from your well known great work for us.
