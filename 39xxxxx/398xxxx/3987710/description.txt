There are over 23 hours worth of film and 16 feature films (4 dvd's) in this pack. Here is a list of the movies: 

Disc 1: Casablanca Express (1989), Cold War Killers (1986), A Yank in Libya (1942), Waterfront (1944), 

Disc 2: Commandos (1968), Eagles Attack at Dawn (1970), Hitler's SS - Portrait of Evil (1985 - the best movie in the pack in my opinion), Go For Broke (1951), 

Disc 3: North Star (1943), Submarine Base (1943), Gung Ho! (1943), The Sell Out (1976), 

Disc 4: Black Brigade (1970), Half-Shot At Sunrise (1930), They Raid by Night (1942), Five For Hell (1968).

Not all of the movies are worth seeing - the worst of the bunch are Casablanca Express & Five For Hell. The best at Hitler's SS and Gung Ho!. Several of the period WWII film's are very interesting just to see what Hollywood was putting out during the war years.

Disc 5: No substitute for victory (documentary).  More details at http://www.amazon.com/No-Substitute-Victory-William-Westmoreland/dp/B00000JPGC
