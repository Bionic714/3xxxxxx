,dk_Barney,2008-01-21T21:08Z,Any covers and labels for these ??
,Arsventure,2008-01-25T23:47Z,"Thanks!  This really rocks.

I know that this is a really big commitment to seed something of this size, and I hope you know that it is really appreciated."
,Arsventure,2008-02-03T16:55Z,"Unfortunately, Disc 5 ""No Substitute For Victory"" is massively corrupted.

Any chance of a re-encode and repost?

Thanks."
,plasmaview,2008-02-05T01:54Z,"Sure, I will put up a separate torrent for disc #5.  Are the other 4 discs OK?"
,plasmaview,2008-02-05T02:40Z,Also - can anybody else confirm the problem with disc #5?  Thanks!
,Arsventure,2008-02-06T04:26Z,"Thanks, plasmaview!

The other 4 are just fine."
,plasmaview,2008-02-14T05:16Z,"I'm still trying to figure out what happened with ""No substitute for Victory"".  I ripped it a 2nd time and had problems with both images mounting on a Linux machine.  I'm not yet sure if it's a rip problem or sone strange software incompatibility.  I'll work on it in the next few days and then either post a new rip or the results of what I found out.  The DVD plays fine on my player to a TV, very strange!"
,Arsventure,2008-02-14T13:39Z,"Thanks for looking into it - I really appreciate your efforts!

It is a rare movie that I'd really like a chance to see."
,loveboy_lion,2008-02-29T06:19Z,i appreciate ur work but it would rather be easy for us to download if u upload all the movies individually keep the good work going
,plasmaview,2008-04-20T16:51Z,"I have finally figured out how to rip this thing.  dd didn't work.  Gnome copy disc (Ubuntu Gutsy) didn't work.  But finally I read about dvdbackup and used that.  Success at last!

This is disk #5 from the War Classics set that I uploaded at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3987710/War_classics_5_DVD_set.  I didn't realize when I originally uploaded it that the ISO image for the disk was corrupted.  Now dvdbackup has allowed me to rip it, but as a directory of files, not an ISO image.  You can burn a DVD from this if desired."
,plasmaview,2008-04-20T16:53Z,"Sorry - I'm getting more senile every day.  The fixed version of ""No Substitute for Victory"", which was obtained using dvdbackup, is at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4145463/No_substitute_for_victory_(documentary).  I created a new torrent just for that."
,BHInc,2008-08-29T00:28Z,"Is it just me or is disc 3 having issues also? - Any way of uploading ""Gung Ho"" ala solo?"
,samyoti,2009-06-17T14:20Z,"i am useing vlc as my player and i cannot get the movies to run ? what have i done wrong

,joe2bad,2009-08-03T07:06Z,I can't seem to compress this to burn it !! can someone please help me !!!
,rapjp,2009-09-01T18:47Z,"I d/l Disc 4 for the movie Five for Hell, which I have been searching for ages...and I am sorry to say D4 is corrupt as well...I even went as far as extracting the files from the ISO image and then trying to play individual VOB files to test and there is rampant corruption....VLC or KMPlayer show blocky garbage all over the films...
Can you seed the movies again..."
,pcfixer123,2010-05-16T03:43Z,"These disks are ALL horribly corrupt
Any chance of a reseed of each disk individually uploader???
Thanks"
,mtvgsc,2010-12-25T05:29Z,d/l torrent with iso data.  all the disk r corrupt. tried to convert no use.  req. for fresh up-load. individually. thanks
,mikija11,2010-12-28T04:03Z,I'm looking for Five to Hell since several decades. I was a kid when I saw it the last time. Is it possible to upload only disc 4 or this film only? Thanks.
