 Finnish record label Space Boogie has been making quite a splash of worldwide 
 psy-trance wavelengths for the past couple of years, and their fourth release,
 'Useless Science' by Troll Scientists is quite the outdoor autumn stormer!    
                                                                               
 Featuring ten amazing tracks with sounds ranging from the ambient dub-tempo   
 spectrum to ultrapsychedelic mashups of old-school sounds thrust through 21st 
 century music technology, and this duo has the skills and talent to back it   
 all up! This music is feral and funky and will whip you up into frothing dance
 floor frenzies. Featuring a tribute to one of psy-trance's greatest legends   
 and a track collaboration with one of the hottest current talents out there,  
 'Useless Science' is a must-listen; it's just what you need to get you through
 the long autumn nights.
