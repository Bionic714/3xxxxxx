,scott_ehm,2009-11-13T02:34Z,"Though this software is outdated, it is still awesome for slower machines. I used to love this app but it's Cakewalk Sonar these days :)"
,threecornerace,2009-12-12T01:23Z,"Havent been able to use the software yet due to the hours I had to spend removing ""Antivrus Live"" from my computer that occured as soon as this download was complete. Possibly not related but too much of a coenkedink for me. More feed back after I install the software. 

Thx,
