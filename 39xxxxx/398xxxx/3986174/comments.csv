,madasahatter,2008-01-21T01:32Z,Cheers for the up.....Do you have VFR V1-4 for FSX????
,madasahatter,2008-01-21T01:33Z,"Sorry mate , also put FS2004/FSX in the title...that way its easier for a search ;)"
,lee_76,2008-01-21T07:13Z,"no sorry,only got the 2002/2004 versions"
,madasahatter,2008-01-22T09:11Z,"@lee76...Is it just my rig or do you find this slows FS9 down?....i had all my settings on high with real weather updates flying the commanche..fps was bad.....i d/led these weeks ago and deleted them ,but for some reason i want them again....but i`ll have to wait till i get a new H/D...."
,lee_76,2008-01-23T18:32Z,"it doesnt slow my fs9 down, but i havent got my settings on high, i have mine on a medium setting as my pc is a few years old and needs upgrading. When i installed VFR terrain, most of the bridges over some rivers had disappeared! dont know why?"
,curly6956,2008-03-25T00:54Z,will this work on fsx?
,lee_76,2008-04-16T15:10Z,"not sure about fsx, i suppose it should if you direct it to the correct location, then add it as add-on scenery, maybe, but havent tried it"
