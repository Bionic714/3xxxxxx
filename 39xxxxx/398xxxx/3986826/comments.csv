The film has two rapes one of the ""she's being raped, but she likes it"" form, and the other of the ""oh well, I raped her but I still love her and she still loves me"" form. Both bullshit.

Leone fails to keep any of the good parts of the 'Dollars' trilogy, but does manage to draw out the masturbatory sentimentality present in the civil war scenes of 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly' (the worst parts of that film).

Perhaps the only upside of this film is an early appearance of Jennifer Connelly."

,mainoRawrr,2008-10-15T00:36Z,for some odd reason it no sound is coming from speakers when i turn the movie on.  Is anyone else having this problem
,bettelill,2008-11-04T20:31Z,"This download isn't good. There is no sound. do not download it, it's a waist of time."
,ucbruce,2008-11-18T03:44Z,There are 165 people on this torrent. Is there sound or not?
,ettnyttnick,2008-11-19T23:46Z,INSTALL THE AC3 CODEC AND THERE WILL BE SOUND
,theninjapenguin,2008-11-27T18:02Z,"Great movie! And YOU don't know what you are talking about sosofake, like your s/n implies. And there is nothing wrong with this torrent. Sound and audio is just fine. What you need to do is trash windows media player and go with vlc media player. It already has all the drivers and codecs needed to play any torrent except .rar and you can get .rar from WinRar. Thank you for this great movie!  :D"
,Fleros,2008-12-15T00:30Z,"sound IS working!!!!
just google for the AC3 codec,
after you installed that, it will all be playing fine!"
,KaraokeDude,2009-01-29T15:07Z,"Thanks for the share, great movie, suppose some people have'nt got the patient span to watch a long and decent movie"
,CovertOPSDragunov,2009-08-28T01:29Z,Download The K-lite mega codec it makes windows media player play any kinda file i can watch MP4 and HD movie with windows media player
,frenzyface,2009-12-22T08:09Z,The second video's sound is a little off.
,disimagery2,2010-01-08T22:22Z,"for ending your codec troubles:

just play all your media through VLC player.

Download it @ www.videolan.org"
,vslink,2010-03-02T07:39Z,"Mac users can end codec problems by downloading Perian. Wish I had a solution for Windows. VLC works too if you just want to play back. If you want to transcode to another size and format to play on iPod or Apple TV, MPEG Streamclip is good and Handbrake is better."
,ibr4him,2010-04-29T20:14Z,"spoiler alert!

before reading watch the film..

i think many people are missing the point of the ending. here is the thing: noodles (not the old noodles) comes chinese theater with the newspaper in his pocket and then the final smile tells us all we watched is in noodles's mind. at the end, every thing is cleared up..

watch carefully every where, every time.."
