This PPF patch, when applied to the Kalyway 10.5.1 ISO, will create an installer that is 100% compatible with the ASRock 775Dual-VSTA. Along with the PPF patch are the development files used to create it. Visit the InsanelyMac post for more information about the PPF, how to apply it, and the guide for how to create your own install discs based off of Kalyway.

MD5s are in a file inside the 'Development' folder.

* Please seed!

* Please report if it works! A simple 'It works' helps me know what to think when somebody tells me it didn't work. If I don't get feedback, I can't help others.

* Please don't ask questions here. I don't get notified of posts here. www.insanelymac.com

Rule of thumb, if you don't know what this is for, then you don't need it.
