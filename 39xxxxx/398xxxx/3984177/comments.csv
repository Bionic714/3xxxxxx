,Destaone,2008-01-28T23:39Z,Why not rip and release in a format everybody knows?? Fucking mkv bullshit!
,rymdrattan,2008-02-05T21:52Z,"Because the uploader probably is from the same country as the creators of the codec and therefor wants their country to be successful.

Thats the only reason i can think of why anyhow. And my computer can't handle mkv's of this size so I'll have to reencode it."
,rymdrattan,2008-02-05T22:43Z,"I stand somewhat corrected. Mkv seems to be one of the choices when switching to free software. mkv and ogm seems to be the most common. 

Although xvid is free, avi isn't licensed under GNU. So that is probably one of the reasons. Also Mkv seems to have alot of effects (if you can call it that) into the format. 

Such as chapters, subtitles, different audiotracks and probably more. Even though I would still go for xvid any day."
