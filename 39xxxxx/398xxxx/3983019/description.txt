::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

  Make sure you have installed the most recent drivers for all of your 
  hardware before playing the game. and read all carefuly!.


:. info .:

OpenAL fucked this game totally up!, just before you gonna play you
need to change main-menu >Option>Audio> and select DirectSound.
if you dont do this, the game crashes sooner or later in several levels.

the other thing you should know is that the game just wants to connect
to the web. MAKE SURE you BLOCK or allow these files from your firewall. 
>Launcher.exe< and >kaneandlynch.exe< this is really important!.
(those who dont do this are getting forsure a black screen)

(again, ...1 more step to handle, good luck! ;) )



S p e c i a l   I n f o   N o t e :

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of a packed exe 

( K+L-start.exe )

as a lame virus, (coz its the byte by byte check error of em!.) 

Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics

you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!.

(heuristics).    >>>  thank you for reading!.
