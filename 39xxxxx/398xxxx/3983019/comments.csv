[V],Subzero!,2008-01-25T15:51Z,"@Svartingen 
thats real strange, ok! do the following
check your firewall (check if the launcher.exe and kaneandlynch.exe are in this list of files, if they are there you allow or block both, and try again then)

other thing you could do is maybe moving the content (content not whole folder) to the folder of your installed demo( , and then try again!... thats even more weird, but pc's generally likes it sometimes weird ;) ... i wish i could help you more, but your problem is indeed a stranger one, demo works , this release not, weiiiiiird..."

,hobblesp,2008-01-28T12:51Z,"I'm afraid that my kane and lynch will not run for more than about 45 seconds. I have more than matched all system requirements, I have set audio to directsound, updated my sound drivers and openAL drivers, video drivers up to date as well. I have tried blocking and denying both files. Nothing works. I have updated directx. About 45 seconds into the game, (longer for start movie) the game crashes to desktop, with no error message. I am also unable to hear character voices in-game. Help would be appreciated."

use peerguardian2, and update all lists!... if you dont know what that is, or for what you can use this, then gooogle for it and visit their page to download this little tool, install, update block lists, and continue your leeching, and i bet , your downspeed has been increased!...."
