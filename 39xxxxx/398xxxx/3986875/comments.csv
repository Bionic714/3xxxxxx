,Teufelshunde,2008-11-19T08:53Z,"Great set, but I can't stand the guy reading the Malloreon...after hearing Cameron Beierle reading the Belgariad. He does a fantastic job with the voices and dialects."
,supersizeme,2008-11-27T20:51Z,"Honestly, if you can afford it (and of course there's always the library) get and read the books,  Personally I found the narrator very dry and slow, however the audio quality is awesome, its a great upload, just think these stories are worth reading......its a dying art..."

,gisoke,2010-08-31T19:52Z,"Hm, there are gaps in these files... first I could find at 39:21 in the second file of the first book of the belgariad, a rather long one."
,gisoke,2010-08-31T20:17Z,"Disregard that, file wasn't complete after all. My client sucks."
,Annurs,2010-09-17T18:53Z,"Belgariad 1 - Pawn of Prophecy and Belgariad Book 2 - Queen of Sorcery is ok, but Belgariad Book 3 - Magicians Gambit is a total mess, ""disc"" 7 is actually ""disk"" 1, ""disk"" 2 is 3 and so forth up to ""disk"" 9 which is 6 for some reason, book 4 and 5 are ok to, haven't checked the rest yet."
,crewislife,2010-09-29T13:39Z,"Can someone provide more accurate information on the 'Magician's Gambit' disks, they're a mess."
,slicer_05,2010-11-10T00:33Z,"RIP David

On February 28, 2007, David Eddings' wife, Leigh Eddings (born Judith Leigh Schall), whom he married in 1962, died following a series of strokes.
She was 69.
Eddings resided in Carson City, Nevada, where he died of natural causes on June 2, 2009"
,Munte.II,2011-02-18T10:48Z,"After having enjoyed books 1 thru 5 i was disgusted with book 6. 

1. The narrator is terrible. 
2. The storyline.. well im starting to think that Eddings sufferd some sort of brain damage prior to starting on the Malloreon. 
3. For some reason each and every character has had their intelligence reduced.

I am usually able to ignore things like bad narrators or somewhat skittish storylines but both together and to such a degree.. I gave up three quarters into book one of the Malloreon..

I have rarely been so sadly dissapointed by any book/author.  "
,Munte.II,2011-02-18T10:57Z,"Book 6 the first book of the Malloreon series is terrible.

First of all the narrator. Listening to that fool would threaten to turn a saint to murderous raving insanity. 
Sadly i think Eddings must have sufferd brain damage while composing it.

Depressing beyond belief."
,LorduDragon,2012-01-30T18:39Z,"Thank you eve so much for this I do own the books paper back lol not the hard backs :>
