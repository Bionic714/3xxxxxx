,sk8flawzz,2008-01-21T08:11Z,^^ that does not mean its fake
,sborrick,2008-01-21T08:26Z,"loder beat me to it! Yeah this is real it is the Jek.THS release, it has been redone a bit by JAwS.
It looks and sounds a little bit better."
,devilman98,2008-01-21T10:19Z,Is it crap? All of a sudden the seeders left. It's such a bitch to get good torrents since Demonoid died.....
,willdrumz,2008-01-21T10:28Z,This is the best fucking movie I have ever seen. It's like a cross between The Blair Witch Project and 911 (yet to be made into a movie but I'm sure it will be awesome.) The only problem with these cam recordings is that they stop at the credits. EVERYONE I KNOW WHO HAS SEEN THIS FLICK IN THE THEATERS SAYS THE GOOD PART IS AFTER THE CREDITS YOU ASSHOLE! LEAVE IT IN. FUCK!
,sk8flawzz,2008-01-21T11:03Z,"wildrumz, i think they stop at the credits because as soon as the flick is over the lights come back on a little, so the cam is turned off and the person must want to get the hell out"

,Kidnice,2008-01-21T16:52Z,"Everyone is going to complain about the video because, the movie is so dark and the guy who runs around in the movie never used a camera and,In most of the movie we are seeing the action threw his camera and hes always running.So this movie sucks and its 93% percent shot in the night so go figure.. even when you get it on DVD it will look messed up And paramount I still want my money BACK FOR THIS WACK MOVIE!..  I seen better in the Sci_fi Channel  !!!"
,bleekerz,2008-01-21T19:12Z,"This is the real deal, quaity is not the greatest in the world but viewable, at least it's not another  gayass domplayer fag uploading, this is definately the real thing. Great movie, can't wait till the DvD comes out."
,WraithofAtlantis,2008-01-21T19:19Z,Is this better than the 412.mb one?
,mkeezay,2008-01-21T20:26Z,"So many retards saying these are fake,do a little searching before you make dumbass coments,this is a known legit release and 2 seconds on google u know the same"
,Windsong1,2008-01-21T20:46Z,"ah ha!It looks like the three seeds have flaked out at 99.8% so I guess that this is going to be another dead torrent soon. Hollywood sure is working hard to pull down the P2P sites. I wonder if these guys get payed by the studio to post all these fakes and dead torrents? remember to report fakes to the pirate Bay admi as soon as you see one.... no piont to leaving it online taking up bandwith 

I am counting 52 users sitting on 99.8 out of the 78 connected to me sorry to say the seeds are there they just arn't downloading anything the butt whipes"
,Windsong1,2008-01-21T22:19Z,I went to the link that eskick suggested and much to my amazement there is a full watchable cam copy online there. even more importantly it is a Divx web viewer so the player should automaticlly save a copy to your hard drive under movies in your divx folder  
,Puerilis,2008-01-22T02:51Z,"Stuck at 99.8%, And because its a bunch of rar files you get sol. Seeders need to seed."
,the_god69,2008-01-22T03:59Z,please seed... im at 99.8% come on guys please seed like a couple more minutes... thanks
,cintronix,2008-01-22T05:21Z,"If I get the last .01%, I'll seed for a week!"

,Novice223,2008-01-23T07:22Z,"Okay, so it is stuck...why? Thanks for the heads up but I wasted enough of time with this crap and the contributor. It is refreshing to have the talents of other contributors that are more technically gifted. To them my thanks!!!!
By the way, another crappy movie is Primeval or the giant crocodile....I think you all know how it ends."
,gadamharris1,2008-01-24T02:05Z,Thanks for nothing Sborrick

,sborrick,2008-01-29T06:49Z,"Sorry everyone for all the trouble with this torrent. I was just trying to be kind and share. This also was my first torrent I posted on here. I seeded for a long time. Too many hit and runs I guess, is  the reason it didn't work out so well. Maybe next time will be better if I decide to do it again. Sorry all."
,sborrick,2008-01-29T06:50Z,I won't upload in .rar form next time either.
,czechmate67,2008-01-30T00:10Z,Er didn't we already agree that the ablair witch project was wank? So what cunt thought the world needed this?

,Magnusftw,2008-02-06T01:27Z,"Ey, retards. why the hell did i have liek 300kb dl speed, untill the last 0.2%? went down to 0 in no time.. "
,Kowalski1977,2008-02-08T15:42Z,"People I would seriously not recommend downloading any cam version of this film well especially not this release as I watched this jaws version the other night, because it's a cam of a cam recorded movie You can't see much in dark scenes of the film and when there's there's a lot of activity on screen even when camera man shakes the camera it loses focus a helluva lot, even though I watched the whole movie and got the jist of the story I still don't know what the monster looks like because you can't see for shit most of the time, I would need and want to see this film again but will wait for a dvd rip, most movies even the worst of cam jobs can be semi watchable but this must be avoided, like isaid becuase the style of the film is done with a camrecorder and all the shakey bits and bad lighting it doesn't make acceptable veiwing thru a second hand cam job"
,Xtenuator,2008-03-02T00:56Z,This movie cood of had a beta ending =(
