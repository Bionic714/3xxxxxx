From NOAA's web site:

Chart No. 1 Nautical Chart Symbols, Abbreviations and Terms is a reference publication depicting basic chart elements and contains a description of the symbols, abbreviations and terms that appear on nautical charts produced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the International Hydrographic Organization. It is a valuable aid for new chart users and a useful tool for all mariners. 

You can also download it here:  http://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/mcd/chartno1.htm ...but might find the torrent faster or more convenient.

Why would you want this?  It's a good accompaniment to maps such as the Garmin BlueChart series and particularly useful for people who are just getting interested in nautical maps.  For anyone that spends time in a boat, it's a good reference to nautical navigational aids both for the novice or experienced sailor.
