,aox1,2008-01-22T08:29Z,THIS IS THE REAL THING!
,Megatherion01,2008-01-22T08:31Z,"So what if it's ""THE REAL THING""?

It's been uploaded here about a dozen times already."
,aox1,2008-01-22T08:32Z,"hey 1m up1oading these for fami1y members who are cheap noobs. this isnt meant to be ground breaking news for you to go around thrashing. if these fi1es were sma11er than 5MB i would have just ema1led them straight to the peop1e who are expecting them.

thanks anyway."
,aox1,2008-01-22T08:35Z,then why are you searching for it?
,sundazed,2008-01-22T09:02Z,Not worth trying to talk sense to I'm afraid.

Why you are not burning 1 DVD / CD and send it via snail-mail? It is easier for all of us."
,masterbluestar,2008-01-22T18:10Z,"AOX UR an idiot! If you'd use your logic, you'd realize that uploading an already existing torrent for ""family members"" makes as much sense as adding a bucket of water to the ocean."
,hockpooh,2008-01-22T18:32Z,"Zero Seeders, Zero Leechers, not much of a family."
,hockpooh,2008-01-22T18:47Z,"Your ""Family"" can download any of the others with hundreds of seeders. You are a bad boy and should punch yourself in the crotch until you black out or until flying monkeys shoot out of your ass."
,aox1,2008-01-24T12:16Z,"you people are so stupid. here is why:

1. if the file is already available on this site & others then why do you care what i do? i certainly couldnt care less about your torrents!

2. when i put these files up i had no interest in look for previously uploaded versions of the same apps. all i know is that i had them and people wanted then... so i chose to start uploading torrents myself. surely you can understand that! if not, wow!!!

3. people who dont really understand computers (like older family members) dont give a shit how many copies of the same apps are made available. all they care about is getting something from someone they know... so if my torrents bother you then just go away and stop commenting.

4. not everyone has your point of view. just because YOU know about something doesnt mean that everyone else knows too. ive seen many copies of apps/files that range from crap to goods. all i make available are genuine copies... so why complain about that. if anything, you need to go bother people who upload bullshit.

5. how the hell are people supposed to get used to creating their own torrents without accidentally releasing something that you or someone else has already provided. if you look closely youd notice that my torrents (which have so obviously bothered you) were the first i ever created... under this handle or any other!

6. the reason im not burning to cd and sending in the mail is because the point of torrents (as i see it) is to eliminate the need for physical media. oh and its free... not to mention im not going to burn a new cd everytime someone asks me for something. 

7. get a life and leave me alone.

in short, the internet is free and available for everyone. my goal in life has nothing to do with pleasing you and/or your little socially crippled brain. if this is a problem for you, then deal with it!

,namuori,2008-01-25T06:17Z,"1. People care what you do because the site is public and you, as well as some others, are doing something that's needlessly redundant.

2. The very fact that you didn't care to look for previous uploads shows your lack of etiquette. People frown at duplicates because it's redundant and spreads upload efforts down.

3. If that's the case, you should just give them a link to an existing one and have your approval about the download itself.

4. Given the popularity of this site, the comments section seems to provide a fairly good indication of whether the upload is 'good' or not, especially for popular ones like this one.

5. The accidents can be avoided by something called 'search'. To say it was your first time you uploaded something is a feeble excuse. Why introduce yourself to the upload scene with bad image by uploading a dupe? Most others have avoided this problem.

6. Good point, but again, the duplicate efforts could've been directed to a single, non-duplicated torrent. That way your family members would be able to download it a lot quicker, too.

7. As long as you're hanging around doing something against people's consensus, you won't be left alone. Simple as that. Live with it.

You are not the only one using the internet. It's better for everyone to get along to maintain the goodwill and the atmosphere of freedom."
,Jerk990,2008-01-27T18:14Z,Thanks for uploading
,orionthxxxxxxx,2008-01-29T20:31Z,office shuts down on me because another user is using it? or logged in with it?
,LatinMessiah,2008-04-04T23:14Z,This Mac user is a meany. Must be a first.
,CrankyBird,2008-05-31T17:28Z,"Hi aox1,

How about I say thanks for this torrent. 
There are copies, yes, there are problems with them (maybe).
It doesn't hurt anyone if this is a copy. The more the better. The more, the likelier it is one will really work.
I would like it, if you would torrent just the product key.
That way those of us who have a copy don't have to dl the entire giant file.  
I started dl'ing another one but worry that it may not work. A key file would be ***** and I think you'd get a ton of thanks.

If not -- well their getting it for free aren't they? Talk about ungrateful.

May I suggest that you tell your family members to chip in together to buy you 100 DVD's. I've seen this for about $20 at Staples and it's probably cheaper at Walmart.  
You chip in your time and wear + tear on your machine.
I offer this as I had a similar situation. They don't appreciate you or your efforts if to get stuff they just have to ask. No work, no cost, no respect for you.
A tiny cost should wake them up + if they can't scrape up $20 between even 2 of them --- I'll skip the obvious coment.
Thanks, Thanks, Thanks. You've helped a lot of people with this. If people are looking and dissing you, well guess they don't have good copy yet. Maybe they have problems with the other zillion posted copies.
I say there is always room for more and a GOOD copy is worth waiting for.
Hang in there + Thanks again. Posting is a kindness that too many forget.
* You can also barter for other services with your relatives. Washing, ironing, a home cooked meal. 
Good Luck!"
