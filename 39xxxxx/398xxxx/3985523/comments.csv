,greatimp,2008-01-27T17:37Z,This is a wish list. Their is nothing in this doc that seems real. I have played under 3 editions of Warhammer 40K. This seems to be a compilation of all three with additions. The book is unbalanced to infantry heavy armies and penalizes any non-imperial player. I cannot believe someone would upload this. 
,ojve,2008-01-29T00:05Z,"Well, appearantly, there has been a number of confirmations, that this pdf is actually an early draft of the what will be the new rules.

It's supposedly real, but there is no guarantee whatsoever that any of the rule changes will make it into the new edition.

,Zeb85,2008-02-25T21:44Z,"Yeah I know, it looks a bitt wrong... Very wrong. 
But then its just a draft thus far. Anyway i wouldent be surprised if the finnished copy will look like this, most of the new books from GW (like codexes and the like) are unbalanced. 
This one for example; A tank will be near impossible to destroy but will not be able to fire almost any weapons...
Anyway, me and my friends will continue with 4th ed.

,Malkstar,2008-02-27T21:33Z,Been playing WFB since the new Chaos Codex came out. Will give the 5th edition rules a few games before I make any comment though.
,lodger111,2008-04-01T10:59Z,"Thanks for the upload.

I can't help but wonder how many times GW can get away with releasing the same thing over and over before people stop buying it.  Looks like they think the cash cow still has milk in it for now though."

You are just a stupid and ignorant asshole. IÂ´ve also played three editions of 40k and in several days it will be my fourth. Take a look at the final rulebook in June and be surprised how similar this leaked pdf is to the original."
,Warhammerdude,2008-06-29T23:15Z,"This is the Real One I am sorry but i have seen it with my own eyes. And Yes you can only capture objektives with Troops choices. So get more of them
I have even played with them at my local GW store."
,Warhammerdude,2008-06-29T23:19Z,Sorry my mistake there are just some of the Rules that are new and some not. ALL templates hit now there are NO partial hits. But the objetive thing is still the same.
,Khorne888,2008-07-03T14:04Z,"Look here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4269385/5th_ed._rulebook_for_WH40k

This is the final 5th edition rulebook."
