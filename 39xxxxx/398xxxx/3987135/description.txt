Product Description

Love makes the world go 'round. And that makes people dizzy. From young love to first kiss, from "I do" to "What did I do!"--the course of romance can be bumpy and absolutely hysterical.

America's Funniest Home Videos - Salute To Romance is an unbridled look at those tender moments when daddy's little girl meets a father's worst nightmare, when falling in love actually involves falling and a walk down the aisle can have you rolling in the aisles.

See if you can find yourself in this laugh-out-loud tribute to the fool for love in all of us.
