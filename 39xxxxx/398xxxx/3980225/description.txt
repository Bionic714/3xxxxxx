The Last Drive is a Greek garage revival rock group which formed in 1983 and broke up in 1995. In January 2007, the band announced on their website that they got together again for some gigs. They are regarded by many as the most important Greek rock group of the 80's and one of the most important and influential groups of Greek rock history.



1. Underworld Shakedown (1986)


Their 1st LP

'In 1986 they released their full-length LP album, called Underworld Shakedown, which caused a sensation both for its content and the quality of production (by the Drive themselves) which was unusually high for the standards of the independent scene of that time. The LP contained covers of garage standards like Misirlou and Night of the phantom, as well as their own material.'
