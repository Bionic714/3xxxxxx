,XeryusB,2011-02-27T20:33Z,"For all the persons who have problems with the D3dx9_29.dll file.

I did the next thing.
1.Unpack
2. run setup.exe
3. run patch
4. replace .exe file

Now download the newest version of diectx (version 11) after installing the game works.

So, the game install's directx 9, but you need to update.

Good luck"
