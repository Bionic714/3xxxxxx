My upload speed is 32KB/s so please help seed after you have completed. Don't hit and run! Share this sci-fi/action flick with the others as i spare my bandwidth for it.

I'll upload a 720p MKV/x264 format after i finish upping this. A 1080p MKV/x264 will be coming soon as well. Stay tuned!

Enjoy ;)"

Clearly you are not a patient downloader!

The reason why I seed it slowly is to prevent those anti P2P organisation to bump into this torrent and share tons of rubbish/corrupted data. Besides, I cannot on my PC for 24 hours.

There's hundreds of people download from me and you are the only one who keeps on complaining about speed and even done some calculation about bits and bytes downloaded per day/hour/second. Just a question, don't you have a life? Or are you a P2P/BT geek?

Dear downloaders, I'll keep on seeding until I decide to delete it from my HDD. Keep sharing! :~)"
