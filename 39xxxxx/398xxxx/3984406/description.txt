Injured in a fall, the President of the United States is in desperate need of surgery -- and the operation must be kept secret. Naturally, Seaview is chosen as the best place for the operation. An enemy agent, taking the place of the doctor who would have used a radiological device on the President, will attempt to kill the Commander-in-Chief with a deadly ray. Will she be discovered in time to save the President?
