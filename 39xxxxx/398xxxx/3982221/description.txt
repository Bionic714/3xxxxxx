I renewed the torrent 
 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3978684/Dmitry_Shostakovich_Works

because of whatever problem occurred that it is not completing.
I added "The Gamblers" what I wanted upload as a single file, because half of the opera was written by Krzysztof Meyer in order to complete a fragment of the master.
Downloaders who can't complete the older torrent can just overwrite.
