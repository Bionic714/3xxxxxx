DEFINITION OF HEAT

Introducing: HAVI, NAZTY, DFLEG, B-LEW and O.D.I.E.

Phoenix has finally arrived with this album sampler from the latest compilation of hard bass lines and explicit lyrical skill from Chocolate Tree Music Group. This is definitely a classic but parental discretion is advised as this one will BURN!

This torrent includes:

Hunger Music.............

Bring a plate cause this song is bananas. DFLEG and B-LEW from The Chocolate Tree bring the hotness and could start a movement with this one. Hunger Music comes straight from the gut, straight from the streets and is straight sic. These cats burned down the studio recording this shyt!!!

Living For The Moment

This is violence personified. The Chocolate Tree presents \"Havi\" from the south side of Flint, Mi to the streets of Phoenix. Havi aint got time for bullshit and came to straight take care of business. You ever hear a live murder? No.................your about to........................

Blowin Up!!!

BLOWIN UP is a taste of NAZTY and ODIE off of the Definition of Heat album. Listen closely cause the lyrics go by so fast, when your trying to figure out the last one, they\'re hitting you with the next one. BLOWIN UP is verbal abuse at its best.

\"Bang On \'Em\"
You need a fight song? This is the fight anthem, put this on in your whip, turn it up and \"Bang on \'Em!!
