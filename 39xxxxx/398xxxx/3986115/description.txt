The Lost Gospel of Judas Iscariot
 
A New Look at Betrayer and Betrayed 
Bart D. Ehrman

Read by Dennis Boutsikaris with Lew Grenville


A bestselling author and well-known expert on early Christianity, Jesus, and the New Testament gives the first complete account of the discovery and impact of the Gospel of Judas.

Lost for nearly 1,700 years, newly restored and authenticated, the Gospel of Judas presents a very different view of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Rather than paint Judas as a traitor, it portrays him as acting at Jesus√¢?? request.

A National Geographic special introduced tens of millions of viewers to one of the most important biblical discoveries of modern times. Now a leading historian of the early church (and a featured commentator in the special) offers the first comprehensive account of the Gospel, revealing what it contains and why it is so important for believers around the world. 

Ehrman recounts the fascinating story of where and how this ancient parchment document was discovered, how it moved around among antiquities dealers, and how it came to be restored and translated. He gives a complete and clear account of what the book teaches, and he shows how it relates to other Gospel texts, including the Gnostic texts of early Christianity. Finally, he describes what we can now say about the historical Judas and his relationship with Jesus.

The Gospel of Judas raises many questions. Ehrman provides illuminating and authoritative answers.
