THANKS!!!"
,stilljacktwenty,2008-01-20T14:05Z,"Thanks. Got to listen to this. I don't believe Jesus existed, let alone Judas, so this should be illuminating."
,fervor,2008-05-18T11:18Z,"Thanks for this upload with a good deal of contemporary interest.  This book is pseudonymous and written far too late to be apostolic.  Still, it is the source of many questions from the laity.  Even before this lost ""gospel"" was found, there has existed the theory that Judas was acting on Jesus' behalf rather than as a traitor.  I look forward to Dr. Ehrman's commentary.  I'm no fundie, but he tends to be a bit theologically liberal even for me.  

Thanks for this timely and helpful torrent.  It should prove to be valuable because of the topic and the popularity of the author, whether or not I find any fresh thoughts or common ground with it.

Hope to return soon after listening to this, yet another view of the lost ""gospel"" of Judas."
,fervor,2008-05-20T03:13Z,"Just finished listening.  Sound is quite good.  Files 50 and 88 would not play on Windows Media Player.  Said it needed an unspecified audio codec.  Rest played well.  These two files would play fine on RealPlayer.  Go figure.

Ehrman's style is wordy, repetitious, and rather conversational; unusual for an academic.  Much of the book is about his emotional investment in the 'find.'  

He basically concludes that this antique book tells us nothing about Jesus or Judas, so may be of little interest to many believers.  As a scholar of the permutations of Christianity between the times of Paul and Constantine, it vitally intrigues him. The ""gospel"" of Judas clearly evolved from the later gnostic traditions.  I agree, though, that anyone interested in pre-Constantine Christian history and the evolution of a wide variety of beliefs and practices, often regarded as heresies, will find this book interesting, though somewhat superficial.  

If you've heard of the ""Gospel of Judas"" and wonder what all the fuss is about, then Ehrman's book is a good place to start.
