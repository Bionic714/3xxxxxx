This is the first clip of the future Fan DVD of the Daft Punk's live show in Paris June 2007.

This clip has been made by a Fan, with original videos from the Fans, for the Fans as there will be no official DVD released.

If you'd like to participate to this project and you have original video footage from the Paris Live show, please contact me on Youtube.
