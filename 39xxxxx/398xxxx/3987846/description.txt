ARMY OF DARKNESS
Primitive Screwhead Edition

Created by Ridgeshark, this is the most complete version of Army of Darkness available.

Respect copyright! Only download this if you already own several other versions of Army of Darkness, legally. Do not pay money for this. Do not charge money for this.

This version includes both the alternate endings and alternate openings. It includes scenes seen only in the Sci-Fi channel version of the film, and scenes only seen as deleted scenes on the official discs, such as Ash fighting Arthur, Ash recruiting Henry the Red, the extended windmill scene, etc.

It also includes a new sound mix which includes some musical surprises from the great soundtrack by Joe Lo Duca (and Danny Elfman). Most notably the opening logos are different. You'll have to see.

The deleted scenes which appear in workprint quality have been cleaned up frame by frame as much as possible. They will never be perfect, but this is about as good as they're going to look and sound until better quality material is made available.

This is of course the third in the Evil Dead series of films directed by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell.

Best wishes, all.
