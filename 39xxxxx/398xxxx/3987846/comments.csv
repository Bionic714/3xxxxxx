,flyboy1,2008-01-21T13:48Z,SUB's?
,tygerbug,2008-01-21T19:17Z,"No, there are no subtitles.

If people have major questions, I'm at tygerbug at yahoo.com."
,Armstrong14,2008-01-22T03:20Z,I want this version! lol  I love this movie!!
,mumbles,2008-01-24T06:12Z,"was this compressed to a DVD5? it seems like it @ 4.36GB... i'm looking for the full, uncompressed DVD of RidgeShark's cut."
,PeterJayNovins,2008-01-25T18:23Z,"Tygerbug, thanks for the up.  I have been waiting for this for quite a while.  But even though it shows one seeder, my DL seems to have grinded to a near halt- I was at 76.8 % a couple of days ago and I'm at 77.1 now.  Are you in fact still seeding this?  I don't mean to be impatient, I'm just concerned something's wrong."
,tygerbug,2008-01-25T20:02Z,"Yeah, I'm still seeding. It's a little hard when I'm at work. I'll do better this weekend.

I have seeded about 6 GB so I'm surprised no one else has gotten to seeder stage yet."
,Armstrong14,2008-02-01T15:40Z,Which one is which on your dvd?  I can't tell what one's got what in it.
,soggyorigami,2008-02-07T18:53Z,"Excellent work tygerbug, but im with armstrong14 on this one. Theres three choices in the DVD menu without a lot of explanation. Could you please tell us what the diffrence is between the choices? Thank You."
,tygerbug,2008-02-07T19:39Z," If you think about it for even a few seconds you can figure out what the menu items mean. It's a very obvious play on the endings.

   The three items are the two alternate endings, as well as the alternate opening."
,soggyorigami,2008-02-07T20:26Z,"I got the play on the endings, i was just wondering if all 3 versions contained the deleted scenes, extra score, and basically all of the goodies sans the diffrent endings. Im thinking Overdose has everything mentioned, Follow the Doctors orders (Basically), contains everything mentioned coupled with the US ending, But im curious about the last choice: Overdose with the Original Formula. "
,soggyorigami,2008-02-07T20:35Z,"Ok, i talked to a friend who i made a copy of the movie for (free of charge) and he told me the diffrences between the 3. The last movie is the one with all of the added goodies, the first two are the alternate ending and US ending with the added scenes. Thanks again for a great compliment to my already huge evil dead collection!"
,tygerbug,2008-02-12T22:46Z,There is no difference between the three choices apart from the beginning and end.
,jpx72,2008-02-15T19:01Z,"OHH GOD MAN ! This is the version I was looking for AGES! Thanks RIDGESHARK! Thanks TYGERBUG! This is the greatest thing someone did to a movie! When I saw it, I couldn't catch my breath! THANKS! Going to SEED from now on :D "
,SvenGoody,2008-04-16T19:44Z,Thanks for the upload.  I've been looking for this for a while.  Nice work.
,SvenGoody,2008-04-16T19:45Z,One more thing... THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK!!!!!!
