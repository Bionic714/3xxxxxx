Trivia
#  The tag-line \"On Earth, Everyone Can Hear You Scream\" was originally meant for AlienÃ?Â¦ (1992), when there were still scenes included that were set on Earth.
# The Predator was nicknamed \"Wolf\" by the filmmakers, after the character Winston Wolfe in Pulp Fiction (1994). His role in the film, like Winston Wolfe\'s, is described as that of a \"cleaner\" -- one who covers up assassinations, accidents, and other messy situations.
