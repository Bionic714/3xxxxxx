[T],grimreaper420,2008-08-11T22:42Z,"I will be uploading a newer version as of today.
Thanx for ur comments:)"
,bloeh,2008-08-12T23:46Z,Would be fine if the Keygen wasnt a Trojan Horse. Just don't download this torrent and you wont have any problems.
[T],grimreaper420,2008-08-14T10:46Z,"Trojan Horse??
You really think I'm going to include viruses when I upload torrents? 
NO!
I'm here to help, not cause problems, so get you facts straight.
Btw...lots of antivirus will tell you its bad when it fact it's not.
Newer version is out, I already uploaded it.
Enjoy:)"
,mypka,2008-09-06T22:06Z,"hey Grim, avast! says virus in keygen. i just got new installation of vista with avast, used to have xp with Norton professional. Norton would only detect virus if virus but never in keygen. Can't say the same about avast, just started using it. Are you totally sure no virus in that keygen?"
[T],grimreaper420,2008-09-08T05:40Z,"I can assure you that I do not purposely upload viruses of any kind.
It's not my nature to do that, and always scan prior  to upload with my Norton 360&NOD32. "
,motmotmo,2008-09-29T23:54Z,Works great thank you!
,playing_hooky,2008-10-06T16:14Z,Most keygens produce a negative report in the majority of anti viruses. When will people learn this? I presume that they don't dl many torrents.
,Corbow6,2008-10-17T17:26Z,"Indeed, I hate when people scream Virus because their antivir picks up a keygen or crack. People aren't too bright, but it makes me feel better because those are probably the same people who will get caught for illegal downloading and get fined.  Great torrent, I was looking for an updated keygen so thank you very much, Grim."
,WightBoy,2008-10-21T12:04Z,no virus (obviously) scanned with kaspersky internet security
,CesarGonzalez10,2008-10-22T02:53Z,Thank You This Works Fine.   
,MickOfNure,2008-11-03T21:29Z,"Works perfectly, Great upload, Thanks :-) "

,Pirate_Of_Thee_Bay,2010-01-29T10:07Z,Everyone Who Thinks Grimreaper420's Torrents Are A Virus Or Contain A Virus Are Wrong.....Why Do U Think He Has A Pink(trusted) Skull Beside His Names...I Havent Downloaded This Torrent But Keygens Are Recognised By Some Antiviruses As A Virus Because The Are Very Similar...And People Who Think Keygens Are A Virus...Do Some Fckn Research.  Love All Ur Torrents As Well Grimereaper420..Keep It Up!!!
,TechWizard86,2010-01-30T01:27Z,"Well put pirate. The keygen just has a trojan signature, but that doesn't mean it is a virus."
,TechWizard86,2010-01-30T01:29Z,The only way it would be a trojan is if it had a payload and Grim if I may speak on his/her behalf..his/her torrents are the first I look for. He/she has never infected my computer with shitty torrents containing viruses like some users on TPB do. Take it from me...Grim isn't gonna upload a shitty torrent.
,CarnageCamp,2010-12-22T18:05Z,Trend Micro Antivirus 2011 has suspected spyware on the keygen that comes with this torrent.
,CarnageCamp,2010-12-22T18:13Z,Fixed problem with Trend. Everything is working perfectly! Thank you so much grimreaper!
