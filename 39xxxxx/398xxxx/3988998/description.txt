Photo-Poetic is a mix of electronic, acoustic, live-looped, and unlooped instrumentation that floats between ambient and driving, melodic and chaotic, heaven and hell. Its creators, Dr Jonez and Mr Misc Ill have dedicated their lives to music in different ways: Dr Jonez grew up on the rhythm of the beat through circuitry - an electronic producer in his own right. Mr Misc Ill has a purist attitude when it comes to music - A master of stringed instruments and natural sounds. Together they blend the natural with the unnatural. The result is this unique sound called Photo-Poetic.
