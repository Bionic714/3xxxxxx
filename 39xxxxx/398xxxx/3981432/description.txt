Description:

Are you tired of having to install several CD's for one software or PC game?  I know I am!

If your multiple CD's for your software or PC games uses a .msi installer, then you're in luck.

I have made a tutorial video that will show you step-by-step on merging those CD's into 1 DVD using Orca, a free utility from Microsoft.

This is the same AiO that I made awhile back, except that the tutorial video is in Windows Media format.  AiO menus have been redone, too.

Enjoy!
