,Ohmstar,2008-04-03T05:20Z,"I have been looking for the entire Sheep in the Big City series for as long as I can remember! YOU ROCK so hard for posting this. And you rock a lot harder for a lot of your other torrents of awesomeness! ReBoot, The Maxx, Baby Blues! Best seeder ever"
,Myrak,2008-04-12T06:35Z,"Thanks for sharing my rips around, I'm sure lots of people have been itching to watch this show again. Massive thanks."
,miguelroboso,2008-05-21T04:44Z,"let me say that I still don't believe what I see
I looked everywhere the dvd's for this show, seems that they have disappeared, there is just a ""powerpuffs extra content"" around, and nobody seems to have/share them all
so, really, I can say: THANK YOU!!!"
,LadyAmbar,2008-05-24T07:45Z,I just want to scream...
,BoogieBabe,2008-07-06T08:27Z,BloodLogic: WILL YOU MARRY ME?! 
,larsral,2008-08-17T12:19Z,"@ Bloodlogic: 
You come up with the coolest torrents! Could you possibly get some by ""Jonnie Bravo"" as well?

Anyway, thanx a lot!"
,trachshara,2008-09-09T12:24Z,"You are fantastic, your taste in shows and your ability to find the best rips.  Long live Operation: Massive Information Leak, long live BloodLogic!

Are you accepting suggestions on what to get next, or are you just uploading as you complete a series?  I second the request for Johnny Bravo, also Cow and Chicken or really just any of the early CN cartoons."
,KrzaQ2,2008-09-19T06:22Z,"Thank you, I lost any hope of finding this amazing cartoon long ago!"

,Burger2,2009-01-20T00:40Z,"I can't get all of the episodes to work :(

If anyone has working versions of S1E2, S1E3 and S1E5-E8, I'd be eternally grateful if they could seed them and promise to seed this package forever."
,Hatten88,2009-01-26T22:10Z,"Holy fuck I love you! Best series ever to air on Cartoon Network! This is way to good for small children, should have been on a real channel!

,BloodLogic,2009-02-13T14:28Z,"@Burger2

As noted in the description, these files are all compatible with VLC Player; if it doesn't work for you, uninstall your codec packs, and if it still doesn't work, your computer's software is corrupt."

,Xargin,2010-05-22T22:50Z,Thanks! This show is the funniest show ever. You don't get shows like this anymore.
,Pogmog,2011-05-13T14:07Z,"Thanks mate!! The wiki says that it was available to buy off iTunes and then they got rid of it for some reason... so this looks like the only surviving source! 

I'm definitely going to be seeding this."
