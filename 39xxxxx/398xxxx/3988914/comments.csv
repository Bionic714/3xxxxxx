,philsella,2008-02-01T02:02Z,its ok thanks for the help Subzero(ye rite) DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!!!!!!!! I was 4 days downloading it and its a load of crap!!!! theres a better 1 to download on piratebay to download..this torrent fucks with your regestry and adds spyware see above.
[V],Subzero!,2008-02-01T04:18Z,"@philsella 

1st: iam not checking every minute my uploads, since iam busy answering dumb posts like yours.

2nd: if someone who claims that he had read the  instructions, and THEN comes up with complains like > I got no keygen I'm stuck on installation with no cd key can someone < is simply i LIAR!

3rd: EVERY fucking program/games does add its info to YOUR registry, otherwise ""you"" kids couldnt play them... >fucking noob! (yer rite!)

4th: adds spyware? ... youre so right >>> NOT!
another example of your lameness....

5th: still wanna help?...  (i have the solution)
try again in like 10 years, but then without being lame and without writing down nonsense like... ""spyware""  

.period!...

all other who need help feel free to ask, but it takes a lil' bit time to answer sometimes, as you may can imagine, there are hundreds of mails each day... and besides this i do have a life too. being father takes time too!, and has priority ofcourse!, and you > philsella < start to read this all again, and then think about the above words , >bonehead aka  philsella "
,lukeboyle111,2008-02-03T05:21Z,"Thanks Subzero for this torrent, i was just wondering if I could ask for some help when you have time. I have followed your instuctions, (i think) and when i click on the desktop icon to run the game it says ""this application has failed to start because d3dx9_32.dll was not found. re-installing the application may fix this problem."" Im not sure if this is something I've done but I'd love to hear your advice when you have time. 
Thanks
Luke"

download this to your tigerwoods folder, if this doesnt help, you need to Re-Install the latest directx9.0c

[V],Subzero!,2008-02-05T20:06Z,"@panicrooster
calm down dude, there are not so many experienced people on the net like you might ""wanna be"" or you might think you are...
and you should STOP those lame posts, otherwise it might be possible that you are history on this site soon!. which means ""banned"" forever not just removed your account...just lemme know...comprehende?... 

btw: if there are other people having similar opinions like ""panicrooster"" in other words those who are not able to help someone , or those who just have a big mouth like he has, being an expert who is laughing about people who are not so much talented as he claims he is... all these faggots should get a life, and you panicrooster dumbfuck... you start asap!, as fast as you can!.. its urgent!... go see a doctor...

There was a missing DLL, so I installed it, but, now when I try to run the game I get the error

""Cannot Find File, you must reinstall Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08""

Not sure why, thanks for the future help =]"

,musgofasa,2008-05-04T15:00Z,"Thanks for the torrent! Awesome game! (played on friends computer)

I am having a problem though. I am able to get into the game and work with the player and features. but when I try to play or practice, the splash screen comes up announcing the course I am going to play and then the game kicks me all the way out to my desktop. I can basically do everything except walk out on the course and hit a ball??

Can you help with this? Thanks!"
,musgofasa,2008-05-04T15:42Z,"PS 
I did need to download 3 .dll files. I downloaded them and stuck them in the ""bin"" folder and then was able to open the game and play around. the three files were

MFC71.dll
msvcr71.dll
msvcp71.dll

I think perhaps there are more missing causing the game to not load into the course screens. Any thoughts?

Thanks for the help"
[V],Subzero!,2008-05-15T19:28Z,"yups. all the gamefiles and everything should be in C:\TigerWoods\

,jleonard711,2008-11-17T17:42Z,"I think I figured out why some people might be having problems getting this game to work.  Before running the TiWo08.exe file, you should pause or disable any anti-virus programs.  I tried installing it 3-4 times while I had Kaspersky enabled and it didn't work, and I kept getting the ""Cannot Find File, you must reinstall Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08"" error message.  On a hunch I paused Kaspersky and ran it again, and now it works perfectly!!  "
