Not so many thanks to my fellow seeders who may give you 1kb/s if you're lucky and take as much as they can while singing 'I am a rock, I am an island'!
Some torrents do have them ;)"
,madmax999,2008-04-13T01:58Z,"I am glad that you like it.  It is a classic.

I have found that I am grateful for whatever anyone seeds.  There is 100s thousands movies and everyone only has so much bandwidth to make available.  I'm lucky. I'm network admin at a company that has two bonded T1s.  I make 70kbs avail during the day and open it to almost full throttle in the evenings and all weekend.  I rotate 20 uploads at a time from my list for anything with 3 seeders or less.

Not many people can do that.  I know I'm wierd for this but I feel seeding is a gift, not a repayment. Of course, it can be both LOL."
,somstar,2009-06-03T16:45Z,Thanks madmax999 for your stupendous work in bringing forth the lost gems of movies. Please accept my heartfelt appreciation and gratitude for the same. I implore you to keep up the good work & I promise to seed at least till a ratio of 5.0 for the ones I download.
