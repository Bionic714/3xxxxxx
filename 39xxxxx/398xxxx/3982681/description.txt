Half-Life 2: Episode Two
(NonSteam Version)


This is a nonsteam (extracted) version of Half-Life 2: Episode Two. It is a clean rip that doesn't require the Steam Client in order to start the game.

In addition, as many unnecessary files were removed as possible. The original Steam version includes several shared GCF archives that contain files used by multiple Steam games. Thus, once all the necessary GCF files are extracted, there are unused files included with the game. These files were removed to the best of my ability.


Features:

- Single Player
- Clean Rip from original Steam GCF files
- Steam account\CD-key not required
- Standalone
- Unnecessary files removed
- 4.1 GB after installation
