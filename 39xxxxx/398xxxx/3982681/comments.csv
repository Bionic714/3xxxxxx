,HorseDIC86,2008-02-10T08:31Z,"Fix for White Screen Issue


If all you get is a white screen and audio when you load the game, you may be able to fix the issue by changing your shortcut to the hl2.exe to look like this:
""C:\Program Files\Half-Life 2 Episode Two\hl2.exe"" -game ep2 -dxlevel 81 +mat_forcehardwaresync 0

The ""C:\Program Files\Half-Life 2 Episode Two\"" part should of course be the folder to which you've installed the game.

,HorseDIC86,2008-02-10T08:33Z,"As a side note, the bin files are compressed archive files containing all of the files included in this rip. When you run the installer it simply extracts everything from the bin files and puts the data into your specified location.

You DO NOT need to manually open the bin files.

Did you really expect a 2.43 MB executable to contain all of the necessary data?"

I have tried many HL2 ep 2 and orange box torrents and every single one had some weird problems. Unleashed very buggy. Detonations orange box version of HL2 EP2 were ridiculously buggy because of gordon moves up&down like walking over the rocks all the time.  
But this really works! I have ATI 2900XT crosfire and I haven't seen that problem mentioned previously posts.

In order to get rid of the runtime error, try installing these two Visual C++ runtime packages:

If that doesn't work, also make sure that you have the all the Windows Updates.

If you have Vista (though it looks like you have XP), try this update specifically as it is part of the Source 2007 Binaries GCF:

1. go to: 

And download it and open it but dont touch any thing yet in it (The problem is the shaders)

2. Go to program files (located in your ""computer"" area where you can in the start up... after opening that go to you're hard drive and find program files)

3. Look for ""Half-Life 2 Episode Two"" and open it

4. Then open the file named ""hl2"" Then open the file ""shaders""

5. You should see three files named ""fxc"", ""psh"", and ""vsh"" delete all three of them

6. go back to the .rar file you downloaded and open the ""hl2"" files then the ""shaders"" file (you'll notice they are the same)

7. Drag those files in the .rar into the shaders file (the one that you deleted the files from)

Let them paste and what not and TADA! No more white screen!"
