ArtyTorrent Music Production Pack 14-Ueberschall Techno Trance Essentials WAV Samples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a repack of WAVs from an Akai sample CD that actually lives up to its title.
Included are a ton of great drum and percussion loops (all at 130bpm) and a wealth of oneshots for making your own electronica drumkits.
Also contains a variety of instrument oneshots. If you want acidic leads, thumping basses, ravey organs and searing supersaws, you've come to the right place. A nice selection of sound effects is also part of the package.
Finally, no techno sample pack is complete without some cheesy vocals. Here you'll find a mix of male and females doing all that "1-2-3 Techno" nonsense, along with some melodies and usable ad libs. The vocals are chopped up, but were recorded at 130bpm and have key information for those that wish to pitchshift them.
This CD really IS essential for anyone making Techno or Trance music.

All samples are normalized 44Khz WAVs.
