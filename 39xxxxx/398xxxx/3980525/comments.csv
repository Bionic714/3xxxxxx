,fruitjam,2008-01-19T03:34Z,"I'm on a Mac with Leopard OS and running VLC 0.8.6d and cannot see a thing. The screen  is just dark! I wonder what is wrong. Is there anythig else I can use to view this. I just love SUMO and zlo666 is my hero for uploading the january basho but just listening to the commentator becomes a little dull... like pantomime in radio sort of ;-)
Please help me!!

[V],SciFi-Sumo,2008-01-19T05:46Z,Hi all sumo fans. I am back from vacation in Florida. Stone crabs were great and in season. Now to sumo and xvid. I use Total Video Converter. I will try to see what I can do with the full file and the SUMO-LITE I do and let you all know as soon as I get the whole file. You can check around on TPB ZLO for Total Video Converter as it is very nice and does almost all formats and syncs nicely!
