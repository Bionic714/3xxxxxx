"If a writer on a political subject manages to preserve a detached attitude, it is nearly always because he/she doesn't know what he/she is talking about to understand a political movement, you have to be involved in it and as soon as you are involved, you become a propagandist. All art is propaganda...on the other hand, not all propaganda is art."

George Orwell
