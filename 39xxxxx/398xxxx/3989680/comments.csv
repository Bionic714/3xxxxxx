,Krokkedille,2008-01-28T00:47Z,"Killerbunny2009: It is not that i don´t want it, but since there was no response, i said ""let me use the tatic of ""aocean"" who said; ""Fake"", to which you reply; ""LOL, U JUST WANT BANDWITH"". (Are u Able to control the Bandwith???)  I DONT KNOW if there is virus, or if it is fake, in fact, i dont know becouse I AM NOT ABLE TO GET IT DOWN. Try to understand! SIX days ago you put IT up, and still not one single download (share)out of more then 300 peers,--- so i gave up on IT. "
