,H00AH,2008-01-20T12:52Z,"Its almost like I Am Legend! 
It looks like a Bmovie wanna be!!!"
,Ripco,2008-01-20T13:01Z,"No ""I am Legend"" is almost like this.  This is a remake of the Original ""I am Omega"" which WAS the original ""I am Legend""."
,coremodels,2008-01-20T14:40Z,"Actually, Omega Man was a remake of Last Man on Earth..."
,Latiino,2008-01-21T01:09Z,IMDB: 3.4 ? no thanks :P
,Oddball_E8,2008-01-26T02:08Z,"actually this is an asylum movie... a company made famous by making low-budget versions of blockbuster movies and releasing them just before the blockbuster...
movies like ""transmorfers"" ""aliens vs hunter"" and  such... 
thats not to say that i am legend, i am omega, omega man and last  man on earth arent all movie versions of the same book... but theyre not really ""remakes"" or ""copies"" of eachother...

tis is a B movie tho... no doubt about it (its what theyre famous for and proud of)"
,Oddball_E8,2008-01-26T02:10Z,they also made Snakes on a Train hehehe... quite famous movie actually... almost as well known as snakes on a plane.
,Vanadis,2008-03-28T01:09Z,"it can't be as bad as ""I AM LEGEND"" and i am only guessing here that none of these two movies has much in common with the awesome book ""Iam legend"" or the superior movie ""Last man on earth"" - so why am i DL:ing this one?
Well - i like Troma movies and *hey* let's face it - B-Movies are so much better than 150million dollars crap movies!"
,DaNtsu,2008-05-19T19:04Z,"Oh man this sucked... Everything failed as much as it could, btw who called this a b-movie? I'd say d... For instance, not even the timer on the bomb was working, it was couting upwards instead of down... FAiL lol"
,DaNtsu,2008-05-20T14:07Z,"forgot to diss the subs, they were also the worst ive ever seen, they were really, really, bad. I promise, you don't wanna watch this crap."
