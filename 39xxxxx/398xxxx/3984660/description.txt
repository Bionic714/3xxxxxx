Cisco CCNA certification proves your professional worth. It tells prospective
employers that you can handle the day-to-day work of running a a mid- to large-
sized Cisco network.
The two-exam CCNA process covers lots of innovative features, which better
reflect the skills and knowledge youâ??ll need on the job. Passing both exams is
your first step towards higher-level Cisco certification.

CBT Nuggets Trainer Jeremy Cioara responded to Ciscoâ??s second exam with a video
series carefully mapped to that test.

Every mid- to large-sized business today uses VLANs. Jeremyâ??s training gives
you all the information you need to design, configure and manage in a VLAN
environment.

Jeremy also offers you a foundational understanding of OSPF, the most popular
routing protocol in the world. And, by the time youâ??re done, heâ??ll have you
performing some pretty snazzy NAT-configured stuff as well.

Here's how one user described Jeremy's training: "By the way Jeremy Cioara has
to be by far one of the BEST Cisco Trainers I have ever had the privilege to
learn from overall. He not only keeps your attention but his energy is
contagious and he provides the information at a level where you grasp it rather
easily."

Watch the attached free video and see for yourself just how good CCNA training
can be.
