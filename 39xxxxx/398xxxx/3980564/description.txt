A big city cop transfers to a remote northern town plagued by violent
crimes and unexplained events that have her believing a supernatural
force is at work.

A professional indiscretion lands Mounties cop Tara Wheaton in the
remote northern town of Rabbit Fall. She soon discovers the
picturesque community is plagued by a chilling history of violent crimes
and unexplained events that have some believing a supernatural force
is at work. Tara rejects the theory but as the bodies pile up, Rabbit Fall
slowly tears away at everything she knows to be true.
