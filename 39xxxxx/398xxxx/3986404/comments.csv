I don't know how to make it clear to dickheads like you who can't read...i've written it in all my .nfo files i upload now..

For dickheads that don?t understand, the videos are captured at a minimum of 720p (1280x720) 
on my end, BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN that the physical source is the same, television companies 
upscale & compress images to have bandwidth while keeping the quality up to par. 
I DON?T WORK at a TV Company to know what quality the physical SOURCE is.
