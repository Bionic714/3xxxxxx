,Lloryd,2010-12-14T23:51Z,When I click the Game.exe and start up a new game this error message pops up and it says this.:General Protection Fault! History: FLightManager :: Init 
,lilykins498,2011-04-24T21:11Z,"I can't seem to get the game to run.

I'm using Windows 7. Here's what I did:

1) Downloaded torrent with utorrent.
2) Went to the file it downloaded everything to.
3) Burned the HPCOS file to a disc.
4) Installed the game.

When I clicked the desktop icon, it told my that I needed to insert the correct CD. When I tried the game icon in the torrent folder, it game me a ""window.dll"" error. Same with the game icon on the disk.

It says in the ReadMe to ""replace the game.exe with the one provided."" I can't seem to do that.

People say to ""extract the file, then run game.exe."" How do I do this? I thought I did extract it. Or am I supposed to copy the files on the disc into a folder?

Please help, I haven't played this game in ages and would like to finally get it working."
,lilykins498,2011-04-24T21:43Z,"Lol I figured it out.

Right-click the game.exe in the torrent folder, and click ""cut.""
Once you install the game from the burned disc, click the ""start"" tab (or your computer's equivalent) and search for ""game.exe"" without the quotes.
Right-click the one on that list that isn't from the torrent (the one that appears in the system directory for the installed game) and select ""open file location.""
Right-click the game.exe in that folder and click ""delete.""
Paste the torrent's game.exe into that folder.
Double-click the game.exe. It should work.

Good luck everyone :3"
,finisher489,2011-07-23T11:29Z,"Bad torrent. I tried other torrents with this PC and Graphics card and they all work with amazing graphics 1280x800 like Star Wars Battlefront 2, GTA San Andreas, Batman Arkham Asylum, Call of Duty Series and the Halo Series. How come this game is in 512x384 and its in such a friggin small window with other terrible graphic issues. What the Hell??????????"
,Vauveli,2011-11-27T18:11Z,... duh maybe because this is a 10 years old game you dumbshit and the games you mentioned are not even a year old.. people like you are poisoning piratebay with their stupidity and shouldnt be allowed to use computers
