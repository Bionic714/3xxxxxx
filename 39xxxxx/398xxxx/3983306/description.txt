Well its been a while since this came out but im goin back over the collection
for a few things that were missed so here it is, full quality, nothing stripped 
the best live footage of pac available all in one release.


This special two-disc set brings together the only two live performances by 
Tupac Shakur that were ever filmed. The House Of Blues show from 1996 was 
released as a stand alone DVD in 2005, and is now combined in this set with 
the never before seen show from Club 662 in Las Vegas, also filmed in 1996 on 
the day of his release from prison. In contrast to the many "story of" DVDs of 
Tupac available, this set is the definitive live experience of Tupac at his 
very best in front of a live audience.
