,dansedrops,2008-02-06T00:00Z,"Seeding with all the bandwith i got, not sending more then 40-60kb im afraid. Guess lots of the other users capped theyr upload speed. :("

,dansedrops,2008-02-07T20:54Z,"I wrote in the top that there was episode 1-13, so dont get angry when ep 14-15 are not there. But is it possible to add those to episodes to the torrent, or do i have to take this one down, and up a new one?"
,dansedrops,2008-02-07T21:05Z,"Lol, nvm :p Just checked the link and found out that ep 14-15 aint out.
Anywho, keep enjoying the torrent :)
Dont whine, be happy for free stuff :)"

,dansedrops,2008-02-12T00:10Z,"I havent added any swesubs for the realease im afraid, but im sure you could find them online somewhere. I am not used to finding subs online, so i cant help you."

,soph.iaW,2008-03-09T13:28Z,"It's the writers strike, they start showing again in late april, starting with episode 14.."
,egzoon91,2008-03-11T18:17Z,svensk text till 9 och uppåt?
,dansedrops,2008-03-12T21:45Z,"Tror ikke det er svensk text på noen av disse, men skyt meg om jeg tar feil.
Jeg har ikke tatt meg tid til å lete etter svenske tekster, da jeg selv er norsk, og forstår engelsk flott.
Men du får søke litt rundt å se om du finner swesubs :)"
,TheLonelyOne,2008-03-19T15:22Z,It is a 14 to!!
,xzeros,2008-03-25T19:57Z,"There is 22 episode in sesson 1. Due to the blockade theres a gap between episode 1-13 and 14-22, but it still the same sesson.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397442/episodes

There is no info about any sesson 2 unfortunately. But i surely hope there will be, don't know a better way to entertain my girlfriend so that i can spend time by my self ;)"
,dansedrops,2008-03-30T18:14Z,"xzeroz: lol:p Have you tried the videogame The Sims? The Sims 2 i guess is whats ""happening"" now, and all the expansion packs.. It sure worked on my x girlfriend :)"
,xzeros,2008-03-31T01:15Z,"Tryd it, but it diden't work.. she's not the kind of gal that spends all her time by the computer.. more of a tv person i guess.."
,dansedrops,2008-03-31T22:51Z,"My X wasnt that type of girl either, but the Sims was acceptable :p
Oh well, lets hope there pops up some more entertainment for here soon :)"
,misscheeky,2008-04-25T13:02Z,"Thanx a lot!! I've been waiting for someone to to this, i'm just to lazy to download the episodes one-by-one on my own... but I'll promise to seed! XD

thnx"
,prodigy146,2008-08-19T06:39Z,ill keep seeding until friday
,bexdakota,2008-08-19T07:44Z,please seed!!
,awesomekirstin,2008-08-24T02:52Z,"Horrible subtitles. The writer of the subs often skips words or writes ""???"" (But you can just delete or not download the subtitle files)

There were a few spots where the sound completely stopped but for no longer than 45 seconds. Other then the bad subs and sound stopping a few times it's a good copy. 

There are 18 episodes in Season 1 these are episodes 1- 13"
,BlairWaldorf,2008-09-24T21:34Z,what does seeding mean? I just upload the torrent or...what?
,veggieliberal,2008-09-30T16:06Z,"this might seem stupid, but how do you seed? I'm new at this and would love to help but have no idea how."
,lizzers,2008-10-02T03:05Z,@veggie - change your preferences on your bit torrent client so that you seed more that 1:1... 
,Archangeldawn,2009-06-23T22:56Z,"Great torrent, Good audio and quality. Except as someone mention before there is one file where the audio is lost but for no more than 45 seconds. Does anyone know which episode is that?  Because I want to replace that one episode with a clean file that has no audio loss so I can burn it to dvd.  MANY thanks !! :]
