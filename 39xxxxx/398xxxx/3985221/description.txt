  By early September 1944, the Germans were in full retreat with Wehrmacht
  untils streaming back to the Fatherland in complete disarry. However, German
  commanders were beginning to reorganize a defense line as the Allied advance
  stalled due to the lack of supplies. Montgomery argued that a single attack
  should be on his line of advance through Holland and on to Germany. His plan,
  code named "Market-Garden" called for an Allied Airborne Army consisting
  of three Airborne Divisions to seize a series of five bridges over a one
  hundred kilometer stretch through Holland. The final bridge, to be taken by
  the British and Polish paratroopers at Arnhem, would get the Allies across
  the Rhine and into Germany. Can you succeed where Montgomery failed?
