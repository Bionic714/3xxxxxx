,toofan,2008-01-16T22:21Z,Thanks alot for this :)
,anthony0013,2008-01-16T22:26Z,"sorry guys, but i don't know why i'm seeding this so slow (~8-10 kB/s). by connection is 2m/2m so i should upload with 200-240 kB/s
if it will no change in hours i will stop seeding this, because it's without any sense to upload almost 4 GB in 9 kB/s speed
my download is normal 230-240 kB/s but there is a problem with upload, i don't know....
uTorrent 1.7.5 b4602"
,anthony0013,2008-01-18T21:00Z,"connection fixed, now i'm uploading in max speed :-)
BitTorrent 6.0

sometimes i'm not seeding, but be patient, i will seed for few full downloads"
,blofuk,2008-01-23T01:00Z,What is the emulator program? cant play any games.
,lethal_kim,2008-01-23T18:26Z,"Hi, can somebody tell how to install the games?
Thanks"
,Kirach,2008-01-24T03:07Z,"Hi, 
thanks for the up.

I suppose we need the additional files to play the roms. but i always problems when trying to do so, and most of the times roms dont even appear in the emulator i'm using. by the way, where to download those additional files?

thanks."
,Kirach,2008-01-24T09:38Z,"all additional files are included.

how to make them work it's another thing.

placing all the roms in the rom folder of the emulator it's a start...
anyone that knows how to play these fantastic neogeo game collection, please share!

thanks anthony0013! outstanding set!"
,bigvagsaski,2008-01-26T16:48Z,i have 100% and will seed for a while if some one tells me how to play them
,defcomexperiment,2008-02-02T18:35Z,"ok to get this to work is pretty easy:

1. go to http://cps2shock.retrogames.com/download.html and get kawak 1.59...

2. extract kawak to a folder somewhere...

3. copy your roms directly to the roms folder in the winkawaks folder... do not unzip them or change anything about them

4. run WinKawaks.exe File>Load Game (it will automatically detect what games you have, double click whatever you want to play and enjoy..."
,pcl_bahia,2008-02-13T06:09Z,"Thanks for this great torrent, but plz which emu do you use to run them. i tried mame, neogeo 5, and winkawaks, but nothing works."
,nonameform,2008-02-14T23:38Z,"This is a torrent I did for Underground Gamer. It's good to see that you can find it on open trackers too.

MAME will run most of the games. Some hacks will run only in Nebula or WinKawaks. In my description there were links provided to the sites where you can download emulators.

I'm constantly updating this torrent when new ROMs are released and added to Logiqx's datafile. If you're looking for a specific game, check the full description with pictures.

,Dark_Sinigami,2008-03-05T15:18Z,"will this do at NeoRageX 5.0? or Only Kawaks,Nebula? OR WHAT?"
,nonameform,2008-03-05T19:58Z,This one won't work in NeoRAGEx. NeoRAGEx uses different ROMs.
,dukeofurl,2008-04-25T03:24Z,In what way are they different?
,romanxxii,2008-04-29T10:30Z,These ROMs don't work with NeoRAGEx
,iljutz,2008-05-01T20:33Z,"I think these roms are only for MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator.

I like to use MAME Plus! @ http://mame.emu-zone.org/

A Neo-Geo BIOS-file is required to play any of these games. That file is already included in this release (neogeo.zip).

Any ways, if anyone is more interested in emulators, join Pleasuredome.org @ http://full.pleasuredome.org.uk

Thanks, anthony0013, for this release. :)"
,iljutz,2008-05-01T20:37Z,"God damn it, only  42kb/s. Come on! Seed, ffs!"
[M],SteRipper,2008-05-21T08:37Z,"The Best Emulator to play these files is called Final Burn Alpha. The Latest release was in April 2008 and is version 0.2.96.77.

It fast, it's easy to use and feature-rich.

And you can get it here:
http://fba.emuunlim.com/

I also plan to seed this, for all use lazy guys and gals out there. Keep a look out for it soon.

Later"
,shinobiung,2008-05-24T14:41Z,anyone willing to seed this again? 
,Dark_Sinigami,2008-08-01T12:22Z,"why do i get this problem in Kawaks 
""Cannot find l0l0--.lo"" something

,sdfghgn,2008-09-06T18:43Z,"you need the neogeo bios

,neelava,2008-09-28T22:22Z,Hi i've got winkawaks159 and downloaded mameROMs for it but it doesnt find neogeo in loading window. can anyone help please..
,ChuckemuHaven,2008-10-22T21:42Z,"Whats up Anthony!
This is a cool Torrent and I have read everyone's comments about it.
There are some main questions that you need to clear up here, and its making us confused here!

What Emulator are these Romsets for?
(1)MAME? and What version of Mame?
(2)Kawaks
(3) NeorageX
(4) Nebula
(5)Final Burn Alpha

You see what we are dealing with here?
There is really no straight answer  here, and if you could please repond and tell us all which emulator are these Romsets are for, because this is making me crazy!

Please respond to this last question.
Thank you in Advance.

,mjapmarce,2008-12-22T06:53Z,is this for playstations? or something else?
,fhc2,2008-12-23T11:14Z,"THANK YOU VERY MUCH !
All games work perfectly in the KAWAKS !"
,SwedenBomber,2009-01-14T15:39Z,"Its not working with mame, winkawaks or final alpha burn...I have tested everything you all said but it still not working. What is wrong?
"
,2muchspl,2009-02-08T08:17Z,"i could never get this to work with kawaks 1.60, i did seed to 3.2 @ 500kbps for other NG fans"
,vikorex,2009-03-11T22:07Z,"These roms definitely DO NOT work on:

-Mame 32, Mame plus
-WinKawaks 1.60
-FinalBurn Alpha
-Callus (an older one)

Each looks for some .rom files, but the games I've dloaded include .bin only. I have no more idea how to open them."
,vikorex,2009-03-11T22:10Z,Could someone please tell us what to do? Or just an emulator name?
,vikorex,2009-03-11T22:34Z,"Here's how to load these games

1. look for neogeo_old.zip (or neogeo BIOS) on google, dload, rename it to neogeo.zip
2. load it in mame 32 in BIOS section
3. load the game"
,DoorBalm,2009-05-15T03:49Z,"So far so good, all games work so far! For those of you having trouble with Winkawaks:

You need to place all these ZIPPED rooms in your root:winkawaks160\roms\neogeo\ directory
----BUT----
Place the neogeo.zip in your root:winkawaks160\roms\ directory.

Also, inside neogeo.zip  sometimes the sfix.sfix file is sometimes misspelled as sfix.sfx, just rename it to sfix.sfix (without unzipping)

,CarlosAnderson,2009-06-06T19:42Z,"Hi guys, 
I'd like to know if I download it, it will work with a Playstation 2 controller. Thanks!"
,KOF[FST],2009-07-06T17:21Z,How about just uploading a emulator with it..
,KOF[FST],2009-07-06T20:38Z,"This is for Carlos Anderson...don't worry about the ps2 pad because it might not just work unless you do some heavy tweaking on it and I mean modifying all kinds of crap inside the ps2 pad.

 Just take a short trip to your nearest electronics store and buy your self a ""Logitech"" Dual Action Pad which can connect via usb on your pc..I run windows Vista I don't know what you run but they should work on XP google it and you will see.

All you have to do is plug it in to your usb port and wait a few seconds so that it can install the drivers and boom you're ready to play^^ for some more advice feel free to PM me.

oh and you can purchase that logitech gamepad at BestBuy if you live in the states..or here http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=logitech+dual+action+pad&tag=googhydr-20&index=aps&hvadid=3620916299&ref=pd_sl_7u5t2mffh0_e"

,KOF[FST],2009-07-06T20:41Z,sorry about the double post... it was the stupid retarded connection...
,slick7194,2009-11-26T00:47Z,"For people who don't know this by know..
Neo Geo roms don't seem to be working on kawaks 1.59 or 1.60 i suggest downloading a older one 1.58 perhaps that is what works for me on windows vista/windows 7 im not sure about xp yet.."
,adambomb93,2010-03-22T02:53Z,This torrent is dead. Please seed.
