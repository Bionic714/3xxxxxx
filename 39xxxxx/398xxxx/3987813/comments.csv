,suplox,2008-02-24T15:14Z,Avi? OGM? MKV? ABC? NBC? what are the unrar'ed file types?
,Muzz_666,2008-02-28T08:00Z,Oh sorry they are WMV's
,Muzz_666,2008-02-28T08:03Z,"Let me be clearer.

The first 3 rar files are WMV.

The OVA.rar holds two AVI files.

The wallpaper.rar holds mostly image files with different ext's"
,silverlion_1978,2008-04-12T10:33Z,"Please seed the:
Detective Conan Episode 1-101 w eng-sub by sonihei.

,kokoro4,2008-04-22T23:35Z,how's the video quality?
,kokoro4,2008-04-23T23:23Z,"video quality sucks tiny 320x240 wmv 
prity much only good for uping to you tube"
,Muzz_666,2008-05-02T04:28Z,"kokoro4  WTF dude?

The quality plays fine on my computer and TV. 

NO not all of them are 320x240 only a few of them are most are 640x480 - FOOL.

True this is my first upload on here but the quality is sound and so is my work. 

so if you don't like it then go download a better resesution, and READ the sub titles.

,Swedengeek,2008-06-06T20:40Z,Ill seed when im done
,sputnik1nz,2008-08-08T09:25Z,"all the episodes worked great. nice quality too.

i cant get the OVA's to work tho.....i have downloaded heaps of codecs including cccp. nothing seems to be working....any ideas?"
,drkdragon10,2008-12-19T04:23Z,What do I need in order to see the OVAs?
,Sikkwolf,2009-03-08T18:26Z,"Look here, I am going to explain this as calmly as possible... again...

Do not Rar shit like this, I will not seed it now past 1-1 ratio... You force me to take up extra space on my HDD to share, when I have to leave the rar files here, then pull out the video files to watch.

However, thank you very much for putting this up in english."
,satanae,2009-06-18T17:07Z,"the last two ova's are mislabeled in the correct order. 25 is actually 26 and 26 is actually 25. all the eps are in proper order. Some of the eps are horrible quality, especially if you have a bigger monitor than most, but the rest are average quality. the sound is spot on though."
,SatanBrutal666,2010-01-13T15:58Z,Please seed im the oly seeder for this torrent. This is a great anime series please seed after downloading it would mean a lot to me since im not the uploader thankz people :)

,P13RC3,2010-02-04T03:05Z,if i get this i'll seed till i have a ratio of 5:1
,rastas959,2010-03-12T06:47Z,"i'll download this just to help seed, hpe its a worth the time i'm going to spend downoading it semingly that i'm doing it for no other reason but to acctualy just seed it."
,Dawn262,2011-07-17T14:34Z,"Waaa!   Thank You Muzz_666!!    This is the OTHER   T.T.  I was looking for.  I found the uncut manga here on TPB also.

Huggs to the entire Pirate Bay crew and all you awesome coders and uploaders"
,cl0ckwerk,2011-07-20T16:28Z,yeah what satanae said. i accidentally watched the OVA's in the wrong order. really confusing. the filenames are reversed. just remember you're supposed to watch Dragon Fist first.
