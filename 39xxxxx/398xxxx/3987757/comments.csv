Downloade the NZB torrent.
Import it into your newsreader.
After the movie files appear in your newsreader, download just the *.rar file, singly.
Open win WinRAR or whatever so assure yourself that the file doesn't require a password.
With VLC player, you may can watch the contents of the *.rar file to ensure it's not some other movie, then complete downloading all the RAR files and use WinRAR to unpack the film into an AVI."

,DivorcedWithChildren,2008-01-22T03:01Z,"Carolinawolf, I'm not sure what your agenda is.  NZB files only work with your newsreader and your newsgroup server.  It doesn't ""connect"" you with anyone you don't already connect with normally.  The NZB file I uploaded came from Newzleech.com, not an anti-P2P site.  Your link may or may not be fine, I've never tried it myself.  Your comment that the ""link"" in the NZB file doesn't work is not logical.  NZB files simply contain the newsgroup and file numbers where you can download a file.  There are no links since you are using your own newsreader & news server.  Either you are paranoid or you don't know how NZB files work.  Nonetheless, hopefully your link is valid and makes people happy.  That's all that matters."
