This is an NZB file for a usenet CAM copy of Cloverfield that comes with PARs.  No passwords.  I came across it earlier today.  CAM quality isn't the best, video is certainly under 4 but the audio is OK.  If you have a good usenet connection and don't want to bother with downloading via torrents, give this NZB a try.  If you don't know what an NZB is, move along, move along.

MRUSH is the group who made the CAM copy.  I only found it on the usenet.
