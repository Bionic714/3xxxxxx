This is not Rodney's best.  If you are already into Yoga you may find he uses far too many supports (chairs, blocks, etc.) for you.  That said, it's still very good relative to all the other Yoga stuff out there.

Rodney has a posse in this one which is a departure.  Production value is top-notch.  I dunno', you decide if it's worthwhile and post a follow-up.

Here's more info than I have:
