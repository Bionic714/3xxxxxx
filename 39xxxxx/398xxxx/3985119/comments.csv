Yoga for Athletes 2.avi  (49 minutes): This is sports-specific mini-workouts.  I think it's running, cycling, tennis maybe... I don't remember.  Probably best to skip this one until you're certain you like Rodney's approach.

Yoga for Athletes- Rodney Yee [xvid].avi (34 minutes): This is a more traditional yoga tape.  Just Rodney, his friends with weird haircuts, and yoga shit.  I encoded it a bit too high... my bad.

The filenames are pretty obtuse.  I just wasn't thinking.

Interesting that you say this is not Rodney's best. It's my favorite yoga workout. Which Rodney Yee DVDs are better?"
,rumsfeld69,2008-08-25T22:26Z,This torrent is very incomplete. The routine that the OP listed at 34 minutes should actually be 56 minutes. There is an entire segment of the workout missing...
,ideveloper,2008-09-08T21:57Z,This vid is great for workout recovery. Some yoga routines are too much for a recovery day. This one really hits a its stride.
,jackalcwb,2009-01-02T20:28Z,"@rumsfeld69 is right.

There is an entire segment missing. The uploader forgot it. Can anyone provide it?

Visitors: do not use this routine until it is complete."
,OKFMDOA,2009-02-05T00:09Z,rh128592: Any chance you could post the additional segment?
,rh128592,2009-02-18T12:40Z,I've had a bad track record lately of fucking up things I upload.  I've long since returned this DVD.  Thanks for bringing it to the attention of future downloaders.
