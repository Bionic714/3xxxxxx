Yma SÃºmac (born in IchocÃ¡n, Cajamarca, PerÃº September 10, 1922),is a noted dramatic coloratura soprano of Peruvian origin. In the 1950s, she was one of the most famous proponents of exotica music, and became an international success based on the merits of her wide-ranging voice, which ranges "well over three octaves"[2] and was commonly claimed to span four[3] and five[4]octaves at its peak.
