There was no decent quality dvd-rip of The Codebreakers, so I decided to make one.
Codecs: MPEG4 AVC + MP3

This is a CC-licensed BBC documentary about FOSS:

The famous digital divide is getting wider. A two-part documentary, The Codebreakers aired on BBC World starting 10 May 2006 examines whether free/open source software (FOSS) might be the bridge?

FOSS contains 'source code' that can be used, copied, studied, modified and redistributed without restriction. It has been around for over 20 years but most PC owners are not aware that the Internet search engines and many computer applications run on FOSS.
