...everyone should send him a email and f... him
... track sucks anyway"
,mrsfreaker,2008-01-19T16:59Z,"I think its a great track!!!!!

 I have heard people say certain bands sound like the prodigy and they don't sound like them at all, this is quite close.

well done edward, keep up with the music, those 50 record compenies probably never even listened to it, they just want to release recycled ""pop"" rubbish."
