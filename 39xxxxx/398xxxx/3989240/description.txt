The ultimate (at least until the next one comes out) collection of Superman's post-crisis adventures.  Includes all main Superman titles from 1986 on, including Superman's adventures with the Justice League.  Also included, the adventures of Superboy, Steel, the Eradicator and all 3 Supergirls, including their appearances with Young Justice, the Teen Titans, the New Titans and the Outsiders.  Thoroughly researched and placed in chronological order.  Dl what you need or grab the whole thing (I will try and keep it seeded for as long as possible).  Enjoy!

This is Part 4, covering Action Comics 694-709, Adventures of Superman 507-522, Superman The Man of Steel 29-43 and Superman v2 84-99, up until 4/95.

When the first 3 are sufficiently seeded, I will post the next 3 parts.
