"The Second Korean War unfolds before the eyes, as only Bond can describe it. The forces of democracy must once again stem the spread of communism, and prevent the outbreak of the third World War. Told from the points of view of several characters all caught up in the same whirlwind of events, this book will amaze you with its realistic depiction of a near future war on the Korean Peninsula."
