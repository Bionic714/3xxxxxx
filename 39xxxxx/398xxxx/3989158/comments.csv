[T],Vilaemail,2008-01-23T17:48Z,"Yea u first kill SS and then update... antivirus comes too... But I combine SS with NOD32...
AFCOURSE U USE SEPERATE PROGRAM!!! It's cracked version... If u don't use seperate program u'r program get's (i will say) uncracked... That's wy is updater for...
Updater 2.0.0 BETA 5000 worked until webroot changed numbers in upd versions to 1000+, before it was around 900... So now we have new updater...

I hope this was helpful...
No thank you for seeding...

Sincerely,

Vila."
[T],Vilaemail,2008-01-23T17:57Z,"Also if u think about fraud with term scanning...
Well u say scamming (scam - fraud)...
And if u think about scanning, yes it scans in real time... also u can do a full sweep (scan)...
NOD32 is pretty effective and if u add SS to NOD32 it's great protection...
My advice is that u still don't use NOD32 v3.0...
It may contain bugs becouse it's new version...
NOD32 2.7 works fine! So here's the link:

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3763546/ESET_NOD32_Antivirus_2.70.39_-_vLcB

It schould work... Just follow the instructions closely!!! Step-by-step... And listen to instruction - not setup (for NOD32)"

[T],Vilaemail,2008-03-06T21:27Z,Yep I am sorry to inform you that updater sucks! And i am giving up on SS... NOD32 will do the job... i hope ;)
