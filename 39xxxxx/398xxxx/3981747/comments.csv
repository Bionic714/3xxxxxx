If you download it, you wont be able to burn it off to a DVD-R. Also, Russian is the default language. Annoying..."
,LRN,2008-02-14T11:43Z,"This is not a copy of any other torrents. I made everything here myself.

Russian is default language, because this torrent is mostly for Russians. Everyone else already got their Season Six from TMNT-files and it is less likely that they will download this torrent. If this is annoying to you...well, TMNT-files is the way to go :)

This is damn H.264! You CAN burn it on anything. But not every hardware player is capable of decoding H.264 streams. If you want to watch it on hardware player - convert it to MPEG4 ASP (XviD, DivX) or MPEG2 (DVD). Or download from TMNT-files.net - they have ASP-rips, afaik.

Can't say anything about 99.9% problem. Never heard of it."

what is tmnt#files?
and will you be uploading season 7?"
,LRN,2011-01-24T21:33Z,"TMNT-files is a site and a torrent tracker that distributes TMNT cartoons (in particular).

I will not be uploading Season 7 because, to tell the truth, Season 7 just SUCKS. Even Season 6 sucked, but at least we've had hopes that the series will return to its glory. Instead it returned to the sewers, so for me the series ends on 5'th ""Lost"" Season (which is a good place to end the thing, since it tied up all the loose ends and did not introduce any new story lines)."
,denzil012,2011-01-25T12:52Z,"ohh okay
and will tmnt-files have season 7
and can i please have the link to tmnt-files :)
Thanks."
,denzil012,2011-02-01T03:55Z,"i like your uploads because its all in one part.
but if you can give me a link to the season 7 episodes in one part."
,LRN,2011-02-12T14:34Z,"If you want Season 7, look somewhere else. I did not rip it."
