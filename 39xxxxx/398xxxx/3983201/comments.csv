First, i do not know who put the collection together, but they did a marvelous job at it.
Its a collection of every ACDC appearance that I have ever heard of, but never seen before now.

There are a couple of clips that are now available  in better quality;  Track number 3 is the same as  available in the Plug me in disc 1.

Tracks 18-22 are available in the Full Concert titled Rijnhallen, Arnhem, Holland.  I believe it is roughly the same quality.

Tracks 13 and 14 are Audience shot bootlegs.  I could live with out them.

Everything else is very professionally shot, and very impressive, and VERY VERY RARE!"
