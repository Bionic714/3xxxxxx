(================================================= ============Program Info============================================== =================)

Over the years, the one point that has been continually driven home to us is performance,
whether it means operational speed or memory consumption.
We've made some great strides in this realm with Trillian Astra.

Start chatting faster
Between loading multiple plugins, parsing and initializing XML-driven skins, and establishing connections to your IM accounts,
the time it takes to fully load Trillian has a tendency to decay over time.
We've improved performance across the board when loading Trillian to eliminate the needless "wait time" between
launching the application and actually using it.

Redrawing times improved
Little things make a big difference. For Trillian Astra, we spent time discovering why certain controls (a scrollbar, an icon, etc.)
took longer to redraw than others and optimized these routines when possible.
The differences are measured in milliseconds, but when you're drawing 60+ user icons in a contact list these sub-second times
can be the difference between a quick product and a sluggish one.

Network connections are more efficiently managed
Another minor detail in speeding things up involves the connections Trillian makes to IM services.
With Trillian Astra, the routines to handle both incoming and outgoing data have been heavily
optimized to ensure a speedy overall IM experience.

Memory usage reduced
You spoke, we listened. Trillian Astra represents the ultimate in flexible,
efficient memory usage; we've reduced the amount of memory required for our XML routines by roughly
5MB and trimmed things here and there whenever possible to decrease footprint further.
If pretty graphics aren't for you, using a barebones skin drops memory usage even further.

Memory leaks plugged
As with all releases of Trillian, time has been spent plugging memory leaks wherever they're found.

Skin variety with memory in mind
For the absolute minimalists among us,
we'll be featuring a super stripped-down skin that will barely register in overall memory usage!
As well, we're extending invitations to all current and past skinners to bring their skins into modern Trillian times.
We hope to offer as many possibilities as we can by the time our final product is ready,
including various best-of-breed third party skins.
