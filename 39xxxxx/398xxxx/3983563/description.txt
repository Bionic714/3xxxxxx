STRIPES - 1981

  Bill Murray stars as a John Winger, who is a basic loser. After he loses his job and his girlfriend dumps him, he and his friend, Russell (wryly played by Harold Ramis) enlist in the Army. The fellow soldiers in their troop include John Candy, Judge Reinhold, John Diehl and as their leader, Sgt. Hulka, Warren Oates. Hulka is a by the book, strict drill sergeant and the clashes between he and Winger are a scream. A young Sean Young plays the love interest of Russell and Mr. Candy excels as Ox, who joined the army as a way to lose weight. The supporting cast is great, but this is Mr. Murray's film all the way. His eats up every scene he's in and fast and furious pace forces you to keep up with him.
