[T],JayRay,2008-06-11T19:49Z," Excuse the Negative Quality Numbers (at the upper right, just below the title) but we have an Uploader here at PirateBay who gets jealous everytime someone uploads a title he has uploaded, or wants to upload. So to retaliate he starts messing with the Quality numbers. Those numbers are there to help you the Downloader. But he is now making them useless. And mine aren't the only torrents he's messed with.

Thanks:
