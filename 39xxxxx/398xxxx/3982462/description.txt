A Day in Class...

This is our first "full length" production, about a typical day at George Wythe College [gwc.edu] where we all attend school. Hope you like it!

Intensely Cousins

These two kids had a disagreement, and decided to settle it the Saberbattle.com way. With Lightsabers! 
This is our latest video, and was entirely choreographed by the kids, plot line and all.

Saber 1 - Zak v Nic

Our first foray into the field of lightsaber battles, this video is 
slow, and fairly crappy in contrast to our newer stuff. We'll be doing as re-shoot just as soon as  weather conditions at home allow. [So please don't comment saying how crappy and slow it is. Trust me, we know.]

all of these movies can also be found on myspace, metacafe, google video, yahoo video, youtube,veoh, imeem, revver, vimeo, aol video and a few others.  just search "saberbattle" to find them.
we will also upload new movies to all of these as we make new ones.

these sites are usually lower quality though, because the files included here are the original sources, direct from premiere.

the demonoid .txt is included as a tribute to our favorite site (with the hope that it will soon be up again)
