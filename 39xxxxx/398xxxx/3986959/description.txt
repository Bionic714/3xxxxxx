Roger Alan Wade is a country western singer/songwriter with over 20 years in the business. He's written for the likes of Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and George Jones, to name a few. He even has a couple gold records and a #1 song with Hank Williams, Jr. His song "If You're Gonna Be Dumb, You Gotta Be Tough" ended up on the "Jackass" soundtrack and became the unofficial theme of the movie. Roger gained national attention when his first cousin, actor Johnny Knoxville ("Jackass", "Dukes Of Hazzard") sent some songs he recorded to Howard Stern, who liked them so much he invited Roger to perform in his NY studio. The response was so great, the cousins decided to make an album and this is the debut from the new alliance between Oglio Entertainment and Johnny Knoxville Records.

Something went wrong with the first one, and everyone was stuck at 99%, this one should work perfect.
