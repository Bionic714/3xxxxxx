season 1 (episodes 19-24)

Indy-VLOG created by Franklin Lopez of subMedia.. (and 'hosted' 
by the 571MUL47OR!) - this first season ran throughout 
2007 and provides for a most entertaining AND radical 
'year-in-review'

(please visit www.submedia.tv in order to; 1.) look out for 
new episodes from season 2!  
 2.) check out other projects in the subMedia catalog. (some 
brilliant stuff there!)  
 3.) to purchase other activist oriented products from the 
website (and thereby help to support subMedia projects!) 
 and 4.) to directly support subMedia projects with your 
donations! (..for instance, 
'END:CIV'- a film project in the works based around 
derrick jensen's 'endgame'!))
