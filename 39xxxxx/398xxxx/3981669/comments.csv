,anakin66,2009-09-08T23:00Z,"Am I the only one who's audio is totally out of sync with the video? There is a serious time lag with the audio, despite the high quality of the video. Kinda makes downloading pointless."
,sdamon,2009-10-04T00:41Z,"It wasn't out of sync for me..but i don't have the file anymore (After all..I actually own the DVD) so I cannot check.  If its out of sync in all applications (WMP, Media Player Classic, and VLC), I'll rerip it."
,anakin66,2009-12-05T23:49Z,"Windows Media Player and VLC player both have badly out of sync audio. For some reason, classic only plays 9 seconds of the clip, and then stops. It doesn't crash, it only detects the first 9 seconds (with the book on the screen and the narration) of the file. I have the K-lite codec pack installed, and downloaded the newest version of VLC. No luck."
