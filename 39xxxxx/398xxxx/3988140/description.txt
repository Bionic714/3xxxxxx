Fifty years from now, an elevated highway spans the nation. Initially a
response to international terrorism, the US government grounds commercial
airline flights and builds THE BLACK DIAMOND, a dangerous road full of
gearheads and misfits, drug runners and grey-market tech heads, all
driving illegal 1970s muscle cars in a nomadic, breakneck existence. But
when the government decides to clean up THE BLACK DIAMOND heading east and
when his wife is kidnapped to be used as a hostage by forces loyal to the
road, Dr. Don McLaughlin, DDS, has to borrow his brother-in-law's illegal
1973 Mercury Cougar to get on the highway and rescue his wife... 150 feet
above and 100 miles an hour faster than anything he's ever known.
