Which version of PC Pitstop is this?"
,LaughingManIndustries,2008-02-08T21:38Z,"This is the ISO of the CD that comes with the magazine Maximum PC every month. I'm not sure what programs versions, as I'm to lazy to install the programs and check what version they are.

For the most part they should be up to date because it is released every month.

I just type out what the card/cover that comes with them says.

PC Pitstops are all trials soooo. I don't think it matters what version they are."
