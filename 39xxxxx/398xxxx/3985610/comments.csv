,fivalo,2008-12-02T23:24Z,can we please get a seed.
,fivalo,2008-12-02T23:29Z,"nevermind i give up...
I always seed a minimum 1 to 1 most of the time leave it all week (my ratio is 5 to 1 on demonoid with over 200gb) sighs, a shame that people cant atleast do 1 to 1 here, its allright for those interested in this project, TCH has done an awesome job and there is newer version available... 3.3"
,scots4x4,2009-03-01T21:44Z,Hey fivalo - where is 3.3 ???? I have 3.2a but not 3.3 - where did you find that please?
