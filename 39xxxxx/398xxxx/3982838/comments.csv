free4all "
,Amoung_Friends,2008-01-23T22:45Z,":) nice collection of Joomla components :)

Pass works fine for unzipping this file

They components look genuine enough ...compaired them to some i already have

...but I got trouble upon uploading the packages into my joomla application

Gets the wellknown: 'Invalid checksum for file' :("
,keepmyfiles,2008-03-14T20:19Z,"does work, says that it can not be extracted. don't waste your time downloading"
,Ratbiteme,2008-03-26T14:49Z,"Well, it unpacks Part1 ok. Don't bother with Part 2 all files in Part 1 works just fine. BUT why anyone would .rar installer files that has to be in .zip format, beats the hell out of me. And please don't put a password on your uploads in the future.
Anyway. Thank's for a great upload boghitza!"

,huggeone,2008-06-03T22:48Z,"Does anybody know if this component:
jReviews v1.2.RC1.rar
an old one, that works with joomla 1.0
Or it's the new one that's been out recently that works with joomla 1.5?

,Morph1234,2008-10-29T21:59Z,"Thanks for this collection. I am sure some of them will come in handy. :)

Just a tip though for anyone thinking of using the JReviews component. According to the Jreviews website the version listed in this torrent: jReviews v1.2.RC1.rar
has major security issues that were corrected in later versions. Probably not a wise idea to install these older versions. ;)"
,Bunnyken,2008-10-31T07:57Z,"Torrent works great! Password free4all is correct. When you trie to unzip the second zip file, open it and unzip from there. When you try with rightclick and ""unzip here"" or ""unzip to..."" it gives an error. By opening the zip file, you can unzip everything without a problem. 

Really worth it for Joomla users

,daebat,2008-12-08T21:09Z,"this is great!!! for those of you who are complete idiots... the .part1 and .part2 are linked compressed files... if you unpack one, you are unpacking both.  "
,Aero107,2008-12-09T11:52Z,"This is for Joomla 1.0, not Joomla 1.5+.
Waiting for the new components. "
