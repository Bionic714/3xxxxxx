,yanban,2008-01-26T18:05Z,thanks so much for the sell swords books ive been looking for these everywhere
,MagiciansFR,2008-02-08T00:14Z,"Thank yo very much for these, do you have the War of the Sider Queen series? Dissoluton, Insurrection, Condemnation, Extinction, Annihilation, Resurrection. If so could you please post?"
,tricksareforkids,2008-02-12T09:44Z,Best torrent ever:) TY SOOOOOO MUCH! hope quality is descent?
,Zen_Kai,2008-03-02T02:23Z,"Nice work! Thanks a bunch! Though I gotta say I'm skipping the TextAlound (TA) files. I can't stand having a computer read these things. No matter how good you are with the batch conversion, they ALWAYS sound like crap. Awesome work on the other 24 though!"
,nitekrawlerinc,2008-05-09T13:21Z,magician fr i have spider queen wars .does any 1 ahve sell swords in text
,RuggedUgly,2008-06-29T05:21Z,"WTF? Text Aloud? That's what TA means is they have Microsoft Sam reading this bloody thing. Not only that but the guy says he's proud of how he put it together. It literally says ""D.R.I.Z.Z.T."" instead of saying the name it sounds out the letters. Maybe it's better than some but if you wanted to waste that much time why didn't you just read the books yourself and it would be a lot better. There is four of five TA files. Be Warned! You won't be listening to them unless you brought your rewind button and decoder ring to figure out exactly what Microsoft Sam is saying as he spouts words out to fast and not pronounced right."
,rixavi1,2008-09-19T07:12Z,"Hey thanks for the up, but to be honest whoever is reading Homeland is one boring sounding mofo :) And when he imitates a female voice! Brilliant."
,einstruzende,2008-10-27T01:35Z,"I haven't heard these yet, however I doubt these are professional readings.  Several months ago I emailed Wizards of the Coast asking about audio books, and they stated that there was no such thing for the old TSA books (Forgotten Realms & Dragonlance)."
,NilsolovNilsson,2009-01-04T15:09Z,"Oh my god I just love these books OMG OMG im so happy I found this torrent.
My brother is gonna seed this 4 ever and ever"
,ftyler,2009-01-28T19:20Z,"why are there 60 seeders and 150 leechers on this page, but then I'm only finding 8 with my torrent program?"
,ThePriestman,2009-07-15T01:52Z,"Awesome! Thank you badman! Love these books, but I let people borrow them and never got them back :("
,slydi,2009-08-04T05:51Z,you are a very bad man....thank you for making the internet what it is best designed for
,Skysratlit,2010-01-13T09:53Z,Anyone know where to find a copy of the Paths of Darkness that isn't TA?
,Dadoggy03,2010-02-06T08:49Z,"To everyone, I just ordered an unabriged copy of The Legacy of the Drow Series and The Paths of Darkness series. Again both are unabriged, I will hopefully have them uploaded by next week, 2/12/10. Then you won't have to listed to the Abr Version of The Legacy, or the TA version of The Paths of Darkness."
,Dadoggy03,2010-02-06T08:52Z,By the way both series are read By Erik Sandvold. Not Microsoft Sam
,Dadoggy03,2010-02-10T00:54Z,"To get ""The Legacy"" book in an Unabridged format and to get ""The Paths of Darkness Series"" read by a Human professional reader get this torrent

,DaveTalon,2010-04-25T19:02Z,i'd like to thank the uploader for the torrent and ask if there is a torrent for promise of the witch king book read by a human and not some bloody annoying electronic voice
,greyfocks,2010-05-22T18:56Z,Thank you SOOOO much. This will help a shit ton with the road trip om taking :) 
,valain,2011-04-04T10:50Z,"Thank you very much (thebadman77) for awesome upload, i actually have all the books on my shelf but after reading so much for 2 years i need a change!
