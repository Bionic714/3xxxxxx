Anne of the Indies 1951
AKA: La FlibustiĂ¨re des Antilles, La Mujer Pirata, Die Piratenkonigin

Movie: Action Adventure Romance Pirates Costume Drama Wooden Sailing Ships

Return with us to the thrilling days of yesteryear, when filming a sailing
picture actually required the cast and crew to occasionally be near actual
wooden ships floating on actual oceans. This permits the camera to explore
the many organic angles and crooks and crannies of the real thing, and for
the actors to bounce around on real plank decks. To be sure, when they're
blown up or sunk, we can tell they're scale models going down; but they
look better here than in many other ship movies. While the dialogue is a
bit stilted and there're no blood-baths in the Hays Code era, at least you
needn't worry about any horribly ugly CGI nonsense, or the cast stumbling
around on a blue-screen stage pretending to be on a ship which isn't there.

Bonus: Jean Peters dual-wields her weapons with nimble acrobatic prowess."
