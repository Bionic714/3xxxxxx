,tiffany22,2008-01-20T17:57Z,Thanks flixer. The video quality of this series is excellent for a 50 year old TV show.
,stilljacktwenty,2008-01-21T17:32Z,"Anybody else having problems with this? Mine download's just reset to O%, while still showing a ratio of 0.3"
,stilljacktwenty,2008-01-22T10:09Z,"Ignore that last comment. I'm daft as a brush. Had to do a complete reinstall and afterwards put the half completed file in the downloads shortcut folder, 'stead of the root folder. Problem solved."
