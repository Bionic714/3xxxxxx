ArtyTorrent Music Production Pack 15-Loopmasters Funky House Producer WAV Samples
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This CD is essential for anyone making funky-disco-filter-house.

This is a repack of WAVs from a multi-format sample CD. This repack leaves out the REX files (you can chop up the loops yourself if you need to) but includes everything else from the retail pack.

Included are a ton of great drum and percussion loops (115-130bpm) and a wealth of oneshots for making your own funky house drumkits.
Along with various discofied musical loops are a variety of instrument oneshots: Electric and synth bass, Rhodes, stabs, pads etc. 
A nice selection of sound effects is also part of the package.
The oneshots and multisamples are supplied with REASON programs, but key note info is included if you use a different sampling app.
All samples are normalized 44Khz WAVs.

Another great release from the Loopmasters guys.

Please seed for as long as possible, and feel free to ask questions or post requests.
Many more sample packs coming in future days, so keep checking thepiratebay.org by clicking on my name.
