,artytorrent,2008-02-08T07:47Z,"Hi Peter. Sorry, but I don't do private emails.
I'm not a user of Reason, but the basic info you need is the following:
You need to decompress the RAR files, using UnRAR. I included this in ArtyTorrent Pack 1, but you should be able to find it elsewhere. (It's only a small shareware download).
The RARs contain WAV files. No further installation, serial number or keygen is required.
You can load the WAV samples into one of Reason's sample players. Please read the manual/online help for your software. The full retail version of this CD contained specific settings for the NN-XT sampler in Reason, but WAVs will load into ANY sequencer. I hope this helps. Good luck with making music!"

thanks."

,The_Reverent_One,2008-08-28T06:02Z,"Arty... I just want to say that you are one 'solid' dude. You truly are awesome! Only a person who really has a passion and desire for both making music and sharing that gift with others could be so giving and selfless.

Cheers indeed!"
,martin.1111,2008-11-02T08:29Z,arty please keep the loops up if you ask me one shots are a waste of time when you just end up cutting the loops up and turning them into multiple one shots but maybe thats just me im a novice and use magix i found it that good i havent used any other program yet but i will when i sober up but for now loops are great and magix music maker 2005 is the program to use trust me 
,digiseed,2010-04-28T00:58Z,"hey arty , i was wondering if u could upload some tech house oneshot wavs too...

And BIG THANX for this one....cheers for the share :)"
