Thank you very much !

Adi"
,jocamero,2008-01-17T04:57Z,No problem; I'll leave it seeding as long as it takes.
,adisor19,2008-01-17T04:58Z,"Thanks again man ! I'll be uploading all night at 750kbps non stop :)

Adi"
,Digitallysick,2008-01-17T05:06Z,"ahhh finally, i will seed on max, thanks for this"
,jocamero,2008-01-17T05:10Z,Got the neighbor helping with the upload.  Should be at least a combined 1Mbps throughout the night.
,hockpooh,2008-01-17T05:12Z,"This one worked fine for me and lots of seeds. It works GREAT.

,jocamero,2008-01-17T05:20Z,The home / student edition doesn't support Exchange in Entourage.  That's why I uploaded this version.
,sal2k8,2008-01-17T05:42Z,Thanks a ton! Do we know if it is a multi-language version?
,jocamero,2008-01-17T05:46Z,"Well, it will definitely have at least US English; the .dmg was created from a US Retail copy."
,hidetanner999,2008-01-17T06:23Z,Do we have a product key or will the one from the home and student version work? (And please confirm this is indeed Standard  and not the Student edition - Exchange support is a must!)
,jocamero,2008-01-17T06:35Z,"Sorry about the lack of key there should be others available on TPB.

Please see the title of the .torrent (NOT student edition)"
,osalom,2008-01-17T06:57Z,"Well, without Product Key it's worthless.. and no, there aren't any keys available on TPB or any other site at the moment"
,jocamero,2008-01-17T07:20Z,"Yes there are.

(Taken from west1's torrent comment page) Give it a shot and let us know if it works."
,osalom,2008-01-17T07:27Z,"That's the Student Version (already installed it and seeding, so I cannot use this key twice in the same network, at the same time)  but I'll try and keep you posted.. 

More keys would be very much appreciated!"

,peacheasy,2008-01-17T08:13Z,"AVOID this torrent!!!  This is a hacked beta version.  Rules are ignored/dont work, Sounds don't work.  Word still crashes frequently."
,mepoc,2008-01-17T08:29Z,"Thanks a lot dude!

Has anyone downloaded and installed this baby?"
,evangelos27,2008-01-17T09:53Z,"what peacheasy says???
so is it beta or he is bullshiting us??"
,zopzork,2008-01-17T10:20Z,It looks sort of OK looking at the install application. The date on the install application is Dec 1 2007  but I have not yet dared to upgrade since I really NEED Entourage with Exchange to work...
,evangelos27,2008-01-17T11:16Z,"i didnt think that there would be such a nice uploader

,evangelos27,2008-01-17T11:18Z,hey echerob how u know??
,EchoRob,2008-01-17T11:19Z,"How i know ?

Just look at the about splash screen it says beta "
,zopzork,2008-01-17T11:25Z,"Dear EchoRob,
It's about time that you at least get a new handle. You are without any doubt the greatest moron I've ever seen doing comments. You constantly mock and disrespect Mac users and TPB. There is only two alternatives. 1. You are just another moron. 2. You are paid to make these comments in that case I seriously hope your employer sees your total incompetence even in smearing since you still use the same handle.
Get a life - Loser! "
,zopzork,2008-01-17T11:30Z,"And BTW, I cannot see any splash saying anything about beta clicking through the first three-four steps. EchoRob makes things up... Looooser.... ;)

But I have still not installed it FULLY myself so be careful!

I still await confirmation that it works..."
,EchoRob,2008-01-17T11:34Z,You are the moron to believe otherwise other than this being a beta
,pq_wolverine,2008-01-17T11:39Z,"I just installed it on my MacBoo and everything works fine.
It doesn't show it's a beta in the about screen, it says ""Version 12.0.0 (071130)""
Thx for de upload, will seed it for ya all"
,EchoRob,2008-01-17T11:42Z,"This is a hacked beta version

Get a life you people wake up and smell the coffee this is FAKE"
,bubblestar,2008-01-17T11:44Z,"Well... EchoRob you are a moron and you really need to get a life!

After having installed the student & home edition I only installed entourage from the standard edition for the exchange functionality. No beta's here, exchange does work again."
,bubblestar,2008-01-17T11:49Z,Maybe EchoRob you have a beta serial. Just a suggestion...
,evangelos27,2008-01-17T12:09Z,"piratebay doesnt work with ratio so why should someone upload a fake1 dont get it
its not demonoid"
,evangelos27,2008-01-17T12:30Z,"u smartass echerob then do u have the real 2008 of???
i dont think so..
bloody b"
,EchoRob,2008-01-17T13:02Z,"i hope all ya
 computers crash and die"
,zopzork,2008-01-17T13:15Z,"Dear all,

It seems we have something interesting on our pirateinfested hands. This EchoRob appears all over TPB (Or at least at several mac torrents that I have looked at...) and this is an interesting phenomena.
Somehow this person/organization tries to scare away people from downloading. Hmmm... Interesting though that they/he is so incredibly thick that they/he does not realize that the effect eventually probably will be the opposite.

Unfortunately we just have to get used to this kind of crap... But in the end we will all just get better and verified releases. :)

I seriously hope EchoRob get paid to do his/her childish comments.

Get a life!"
,Tarmangani,2008-01-17T13:23Z,"I don't know what's the matter with echerob et al, but I've installed it and:

   - no ""beta"" string anywhere
   - after installing the apps, the installer searches for old versions of office to remove them, and when it finds ***the september beta (the only torrented one afaik)*** it recognizes it and it says explicitly that it's advisable to remove it since it could generate problems (don't remember the exact words since I've done it a couple of hours ago).
  - BTW: Word starts a little faster (=slow anyway) than the beta
  - Word is slow *just inserting text* inside a cell of a table of a 7 MB+ document made of one table with two cols and 5000+ rows (that's what I use Word for... ask and I will tell)
  - no problems with the same doc with WinWord 2003 in Parallels
  - OTOH: No problem inserting text inside a cell of a table of a 3 MB+ document made of one table with two cols and 2400+ rows...
  - Mac user since september 1984 (one of the first 128K Macs at 220 volts made in Ireland)
  - Power user of MacWord since v4.x (as of today, no other word processor handles the docs with tables I work with)
  - As far as I can tell, this torrent is OK."
,EchoRob,2008-01-17T13:24Z,"zopzork, installing this torrent will infect your computer witha virus this is a badly hacked ersion od MS OFFICE 2008 BETA

Now i want a apology from you

Get on ya hands and knees and beg like a dog for forgiveness"
,EchoRob,2008-01-17T13:25Z,Of course it doesnt say it is beta it has been hacked to fool u people
,bubblestar,2008-01-17T13:31Z,"@ EchoRob

You need some professional help!"
,EchoRob,2008-01-17T13:46Z,"I am the Professional 

"
,ClanMaster,2008-01-17T13:48Z,"This is NO FAKE!!

This is definitely MS Office 2008 for Mac Standard Edition and Entourage does support Exchange (cause I just used it)

Installs all files correctly (checked with bought version) and removes Office 2004 and any other versions if installed. The serial number can be found further back in this section.

Don't listen to the doubters! Install and be Happy - don't forget to seed :)"
,EchoRob,2008-01-17T14:03Z,"ClanMaster and jocamero are the same person

Stop posting bulshit its a fn fake"
,onebelow0,2008-01-17T14:06Z,echorob takes it in the ass like a champ!
,macaronas,2008-01-17T14:36Z,"EchoRob, it's much better to s__k it like a pro!

Go f__k yourself!"
,ixulian,2008-01-17T15:00Z,"I installed this with the same serial on 2 computers of my network.

Now can't run any office app simultaneously in different machines of my network since the licenses overlap.

I tried removing it with the removal tool office 2008 comes with, but when I installed it again, it would not ask me for the new cd key.

How can I de-serialize an already installed copy of office 2008? 

Thanks"
,kevingy,2008-01-17T15:16Z,"FYI,

I just installed - and it UPGRADED my BETA copy. I connect to an Exchange without issues and MY DAY finally works. So this version is definitely not the BETA that has been floating around."
,antamony,2008-01-17T15:45Z,"echorob is just a lonely wanker looking for attention.

He won't be happy unless we use him for a hackie sack."

,maera,2008-01-17T16:17Z,"ist it multilanguage? ( I installed the Home and student one, it's only english I need french one). Echorob is a microsoft secret agent, to prevent us from downloading. Thes versions are fully functionnal, no beta..."
,zopzork,2008-01-17T16:33Z,Has anyone tried to autoupdate?

Get that big overflowing wallet and go buy the retail products. The moaning achieves nothing, but annoying people. I think echorob needs a friend..."

not only works
WORKS GREAT"
,Swebian,2008-01-17T22:01Z,Is it multilanguage so ?
,hockpooh,2008-01-17T22:05Z,"echorob is just some homely looking young kid with bad ache from a poor diet, and his Mom makes him stay in his room in their trailer while she boinks a different drunk from the bar every night. So he goes on his computer and lashes out at the world for attention. I feel sorry for the kid. I would adopt him but he might be too tweaked out by now to save."
,plume,2008-01-17T23:09Z,"Echorob says in one post:

""How i know ?

Just look at the about splash screen it says beta""

and then a bit later says:

""Of course it doesnt say it is beta it has been hacked to fool u people ""

I think it is pretty clear who is the fool here."
,osalom,2008-01-17T23:24Z,"Echorob works for msft, It's obvious, he is talking about viruses (those exist only in msft world)"
,hockpooh,2008-01-17T23:35Z,"I think you're right, I think echorob is connected to MicroSoft in some way. He has no uploads and he is clearly not a Mac user. Most Mac users are polite and honest, and PC users make and send viruses around to get their high."

,remarkrg,2008-01-18T10:26Z,"I have one last thing to say about ""moaning"" echorob. For a person with tens of millions of friends he sure spends a lot of time online. Working for Disney requires at least some degree of professionalism not to mention literacy. Finally, the pay from production and editing with Disney Studios is very good, but yet echorob goes around and downloads pirated software and complains about it."

,arbyman,2008-01-18T13:45Z,"Just to confirm, I used the Beta and this is not a Beta! Nothing has been hacked and it is a full release working perfectly under Leopard.  Exchange also works.  I would recommend not checking the box to remove 2004 though until you are 100% happy with 2008.  I found a bug with PowerPoint in showing a shadow of the text on bullet points before the text shows on the screen in slide show mode."

,remarkrg,2008-01-19T00:55Z,"Installs perfectly with the provided Prod. Keys and seems fully functional. Office still does not play well with Spaces on Leopard and if you are using Spaces it is a good idea to disable it BEFORE installing. I have downloaded to test it out on one of my machines before forking out the cash. (Business expense so it is a write-off.)

I did make backups of all my Office files as well as Mail first just in case. Since I was testing the standard install that removes older versions I also had my (legal) copy of Office 2004 on hand in the event I needed to reinstall. After the first Office app is launched all the others seems to launch quickly unless I restart the machine then it take a bit for the first app to launch again. So far it has not crashed or stalled or corrupted any files. "
