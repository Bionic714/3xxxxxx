FREE FOR DOWNLOAD!!

Sum aka SuMoNe aka Jeff has been turning out killer cuts for the past few years w/ releases on Dubplatelet and Mos-Hi and upcoming releases on Renegade, Planet Mu, and iQ Entertainment.  Being an avid video gamer, Jeff hacked his PSP almost immediately upon purchase, installing the freeware program PSP Rhythm.  Using the advanced audio engine of the PSP and PSP Rhythm, he produced an entire album that spans several sounds from straight up Jungle to Dubstep to Trip-Hop to Breakcore.

iQ Entertainment is extremely proud to be using this creative labor of love as the official pre-release for our new digital label, iQD000.  Our first official release will come after the first of the year featuring tunes from Sum, K-Step, and new comer Dave Owen.
