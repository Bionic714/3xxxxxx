Plot:
Scott stars as Dr. John Russell, a music professor living in New York City, who moves cross-country to Washington State following the tragic deaths of his wife and daughter in a traffic accident while on a winter vacation in upstate New York. In suburban Washington, Russell rents a large, old, and eerie-looking Victorian-era mansion and attempts to piece together his life. However, Dr. Russell soon discovers that he has unexpected company in his new home when the ghost of a long murdered child haunts the house, shattering windows and abruptly opening and shutting doors. Russell investigates and finds that the mystery is linked to a powerful US senator.
