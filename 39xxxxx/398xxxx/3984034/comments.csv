,scheu2112,2008-01-20T04:07Z,"Thanks TimD!  FBO Rocks...
Later, Scheu."
,TimD54,2008-01-22T05:28Z,"professorvalley, there's no Master>CDR on RO or Dime.  The source they have is from a Master that was copied to 7.5fps reel-to-reel and then to CD-R.  I know the guy who sold the reel-to-reels to the bootlegger who released the show.  My source is straight from the master cassettes, not the reel-to-reel transfer."
,professorvalley,2008-01-29T03:25Z,"this was the info on both ro and dime's torrents:

------------
TUCSON COMMUNITY CENTER 
TUCSON, AZ JUNE 28, 1972 

I got this recording directly from the taper in 2003. 

Lineage given was Analog master cassette>PC>my cdr. 

Yours would be: AM>PC>CDR>WAV>FLAC
----------------

that's the one i was talking about.  but discussion at ro (heaven forbid) is that yours is an upgrade, so nice job on this one.  8)"
,TimD54,2008-01-29T10:22Z,"And as I said in my notes, anyone who got the show prior to this got copies from the R2R.  I got that from the taper.  Rob has been known to mislead people, mark recordings with dropouts, pulse-channel-swaps, cuts, missing tracks - not unlike Mike Millard.  This source is missing all of those.  

Thank you for the acknowledgement.  I know you've been beating on my recent series, and man, I'm sure you're well intentioned.  But I really do my homework on this stuff.  Any show I'm releasing I'm doing for a reason, whether it's a historical document, or exceptional for some reason (like the disputed date shows) or a rare example of a raw show just dumped on the public like 9-19-1970.  

I've been around a long time and I have a really strong reputation.  There are softer targets than me.  I offer you this strictly as advice.
