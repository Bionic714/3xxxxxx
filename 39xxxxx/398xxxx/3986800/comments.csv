,PearlOfDarkGrace,2010-05-27T04:17Z,"Thanks for all the hard work and effort that must've gone into putting this up.  Really appreciate all of it.

That being said, wish I didn't waste over 4GB of my downloads trying to get it..  I was looking for full episodes, not bits of this one & that one.  Was extremely disappointed once it arrived.  :("
[T],Abrasax,2010-06-13T18:14Z,#PearlOfDarkGrace  - Just saw your comment. Don't really know what you mean. I have had this torrent up for over 2 years now and haven't heard that it should be something wrong with it. Explain?
