,blahsblah2001,2008-03-01T21:07Z,"Hi there guys. I need a bit of help. I'm only trying to play Portal at the moment, I don't really have 40 free gigs to throw around. So I've got portal english, portal content, base source engine 2, (source 2007) binaries, shared materials, shared models, shared sounds, and then (source) engine, materials, models, sounds, and sourcesdk. 
Are there any other gcf's that I need? 
I've also installed toolbox and GCFScape, and these indicate that portal content and source 2007 binaries are both outdated. How do I update?  
Prior searches for help find only dozens of schoolkids whining about 'greatest common factors.' 
Any help welcome.
