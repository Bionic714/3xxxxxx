None of the id3 tags are filled out, and a couple files are missing the song name entirely:

Lions track 13 - Lay It All on Me
Shake Your Money Maker track 13 - Mercy, Sweet Moan"

,Hawman,2008-11-25T00:19Z,Cheers but terribly labeled!! Sort it out!
,LadyAbagail,2009-01-03T07:26Z,"Don't give a crap about file tags.  They are easy _as_ to fix and fill out.  I only wish these were lossless.  I can't hand edit the sound quality back into a shitty mp3 o,O"

,parangaitok,2009-06-11T13:49Z,"Badly Labelled.  Now I have a huge list of track numbers and album names.  Person should have thought about fixing this before posting the torrent.

On the other hand, at least they did have the courtesy to post the collection in the first place.  I don't see anyone else fixing the problem and submitting the torrent."
