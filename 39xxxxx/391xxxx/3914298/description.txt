This is the 2nd LP version  of the Hitchiker's Radio Series, released in 1980. It has NEVER been released in any other form, and it differs from Series 1 in the radio series in many ways - mostly the music is different, though some of the dialogue is different, and so are one or two of the voice actors. The dialogue is closer to the TV series if anything.
