We can No Longer Afford To Ignore is a short film about how our privacy is being take away, this torrent includes a uncompressed 768 x 420 AVI video and a compressed 768 x 420 WMV video (No DRM).

This talks about we can't ignore the facts that our privacy is gone and they are putting cameras !!!EVERYWHERE!!! and if we don't do anything to stop this, or legally fight this, we could have surveillance everywhere, even in bathrooms, restrooms, toilets, dressing rooms, topless beaches, nude beaches, practically anywhere where you don't want perverts.

Surveillance can help Child Molesters, and child pornographers because theres no regulation on whos gonna spy on who, our privacy is decaying, and if we continue to ignore that were heading into a surveillance society we are heading for TROUBLE.
