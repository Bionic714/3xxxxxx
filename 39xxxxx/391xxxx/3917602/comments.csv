,keiron80,2008-06-06T13:10Z,"If you don't have anything to hide, you don't have anything to be afraid of?

Really?   What of the case where a psychopath runs a country, and decides that what ought to be hidden is oh I don't know - being Jewish (Hitler) or, perhaps Muslim (Bush) - Would you be concerned then?

Until we have a society that doesn't give power to psychopaths, it might be worth being concerned about giving more power to a smaller and smaller number of people, who inherently desire power first, and love people second.

In the meantime, most importantly - whether there are cameras or not, this reminds me of an old quote:

There is a policeman inside your head: He must be destroyed.

In other words - we all have free choice - even if there is a nut job who might kill us for, oh I don't know believing in equality, or feeding the worlds hungry before profit.  Peace before war, and all these other ""crazy liberal ideas"" that I'll take any day over the neoliberal capitalist mass psychopathy so engrossing many in the world."
