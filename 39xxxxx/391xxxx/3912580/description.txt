KylÃ?Â¤hullut originated in Tampere, Finland in a restaurant called Telakka at the year of mercy 2003 when Alexi Laiho and Vesku Jokinen decided, after taking seats to the same table and enjoying servings of the house that they are able to upset the Finnish music life not just by the power of Klamydia and COB. The idea stayed to germinate and it didnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t take long when Vesku sent couple of green fruits of songs for Alexi to revise. Alexi had been in touch with Lillman who he had played with e.g. in Sinergy. The first meeting of Vesku and Tonmi took place after midnight in AlexiÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s place, when Tonmi awoke that Vesku was drawing cunts with China ink to his legs. The rehearsal of the first EP was very \"profound\". Tonmi beated the corner of the table, Vesku sang and Alexi played acoustic guitar. The rehearsals lasted even 20 minutes. That was the only rehearsal that KylÃ?Â¤hulluÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s have ever had. To the studio were went to have fun for a couple of days. Laughs, swigs and bad jokes after another.

PerÃ?Â¤aukko sivistyksessÃ?Â¤ (Asshole in Civilization) is the latest album from this Finnish humour rock act. The lyrics are like usually all in Finnish, and this time around, they sing about politics, the prime minister of Finland, a tv show called Big Brother, Paris Hilton etc. and they don\'t have much positive to say about anything.

Also featuring Nightwish-keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen on keyboards Tapio Wilska singins chores.
