I've looked after this song since I heard it on the new Hitman trailer but at first it was nowhere to be found and when I did found it the bit rate was too low or the person who sampled it did a real poor job. 

Finally I stumbled upon the song on Hitman the movie's homepage and managed to make a fair recording of it.

Christina England Hale - Ave Maria 320kbps mp3

I hope you are as satisfied with finding this as I am but I think I will buy the Hitman soundtrack when it becomes available so I can get that extra quality which this song deserves.
