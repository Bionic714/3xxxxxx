,BoyTheGeek,2007-12-02T00:09Z,HOLY SHIT THX. I have also been looking for this version since Blood money
,havoc89,2007-12-18T09:54Z,"Thanks man, great song!"
,TheBlackFeather,2008-01-02T13:59Z,"I really prefer the one from Hitman: Blood Money. It's a child's voice, and the imperfections really make it a phenomenal recording. Hale's voice is okay, but it's too clean, and not really any emotion or music made from it."
,Plutark,2008-04-23T21:26Z,i agree with TheBlackTeather. the movie version is so much better.

I don't seed often, but this is something that needs to be heard by as many people as possible

Thanks for the upload, the youtube version has been taunting me, I reallly wanted the actual file"
,SgtVoodoo,2009-03-28T04:52Z,"Also it says 4 seeders and 0 leechers, and its not downloading at all, I kind of need the file to seed;), so if anyone reads this, a seed would be nice, its not that big of a file"
,stentun,2009-08-04T10:32Z,please seed!!!
,Carlibengarli,2012-04-02T21:27Z,Thanks! :)
