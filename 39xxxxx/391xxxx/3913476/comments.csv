THIS v1.6 patch DOES however require v.1.5 patch been previously applied."

i dont get audio in the menu screen and in-game but opening cutscene plays after that nothing else

process already tried--------------------------

copy and pasting original audio files into win folder and not replacing the EAX and lip sync files

de reg then re registering using reg setup

reinstalling whole thing by doing it from scratch from the zip files

please help if you have gotten it to work please post solution"

,noseman-2,2008-05-19T23:42Z,"christonian: It's not dopemans fault. The 1.5 jittery sound-bug is inherent in the 1.5 patch, though it only applies to few computers.

Sadly, mine is one of them."
,whitewolf11763,2008-06-06T22:59Z,Anyone seen anything of dopeman lately? He hasnt put anything new on here in a while

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4511244

It is dopeman's work/ version of Two Worlds all gathered in one place till patch 1.6"
,paul423,2009-01-20T16:00Z,"@ BlackwingDragon: Are u talking about dopeman? Why? What do u have against him?
I find the idea of not runing an installer/ unpacker to play a game very usefull/ simple..."
,F.R.O.G,2009-05-10T02:44Z,"hey everyone guess what? there is a change dopeman may be coming back. here is why i think this, well toed left and said he was never coming back because his wife got cancer than on his subzero! tpb account he uploaded another torrent/game under his new team name tptb. so it seems toed is back, and if you read the list of people that tptb consist of it says it contains toed, dopeman, synergy and freeman g ripper so if toed came back for this thing there is a good change that dopeman will too."
,Andyus,2009-06-10T17:00Z,"dopeman thanks a lots for all works, may i ask if you can crack also 1.7 patch? and if there are possiblity switch languages? thanks anyway and sorry for my bad english"

,juhle,2011-03-16T19:10Z,"Works fine. Applied the 1.5 first and then this 1.6 patch, You need to use the keygen to activate the game. 
What a difference, lots of improvements in game and the graphics is much better.
