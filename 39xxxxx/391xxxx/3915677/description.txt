Plot Outline (taken from Wikipedia):

Narrated by the gigantic but docile and schizophrenic Columbian Indian "Chief" Bromden, who has pretended to be a deaf-mute for years, this story focuses on the antics of gleefully rebellious Randle McMurphy, a transferee from a workfarm prison to a mental hospital. The all-male asylum is based upon the old Pendleton, Oregon asylum (now the Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution). With little medical oversight, the hospital ward is run by the buttoned-up, middle-aged Nurse Ratched (or "the Big Nurse") and her orderlies, whom the Chief describes as resentful black men.
