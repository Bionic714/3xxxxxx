,Tyboy,2007-12-01T19:37Z,PLEASE SEEED!!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. I will seed for a few days when i have a full copy but we need someone to seed for now.....
[T],relentlesstech,2007-12-02T05:03Z,"I am seeding with unlimited bandwidth, but I am the lone seeder with 100%, and I have a LOT of others trying to get it at the same time - I have over 20 people at 53.2% complete, so it should start going faster as more people get it..."
,BernardoRocha,2007-12-04T08:03Z,SEED PLEASE!
,Darkwolf_1982,2007-12-05T17:29Z,"FOR ALL WHO ARE DOWNLOADING AND TO THE UPLOADER:
There is a major error in the episode numbering!
Just check out the official episode list Wiki to see what I mean: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Family_Guy_episodes
Of course, one can solve this major error after downloading using this Wiki list and a multi rename tool (I used Total Commander's solution taking me 5 minutes of my time.)"
,rutger_h,2007-12-05T23:29Z,"Could people start seeding. ItÂ´s kind of a big collection. 10kb/s right now. gonna take a freakin century to download it.
Please seed!"
,MrMalkovich,2007-12-06T22:42Z,"Yes, Please Seed! I am tired of watching the same episodes on Winamp TV.....thanks for making this collection relentlesstech"
[T],relentlesstech,2007-12-07T15:42Z,"To Darkwolf_1982:

Wiki is wrong - I keep VERY close track of what the episodes I have are - There are no mistakes - Before I compiled this torrent I double-checked all the episodes to make sure they are correct..."
,n.giorgino,2007-12-08T14:24Z,6kb/s this is gonna take weeks. PLEASE SEED!!!              
,ImaginaryGum,2007-12-12T12:51Z,"relentlesstech: Season 4 didn't stop with ""Peter's Got Woods"", it continued till ""Untitled Griffin Family History"".

[T],vance43211,2007-12-16T07:24Z,if the people would seed for at least 24hrs after downloading this we would have it 2 days ago.
[T],relentlesstech,2008-02-27T19:43Z,"I'm getting pissed that nobody is seeding this - I can't seed this one, and all my other torrents, all at once, and expect to have good speeds!  I've had over 30 people finish this, and stop seeding once it's done - I've been seeding this forever, but it seems to go nowhere fast - You guys need to start seeding, even if for only a few hours!"
,djlorenzen,2008-02-29T12:46Z,"Some of the people that download this torrent don't know this series, they just wanna check the first episode out. I'm one of them.

By making sure they 'only' get the first episode instead of a little of every episode, we can spare a lot of bandwidth."
,lostboybinns,2008-03-03T02:57Z,anyone tried this on a stand alone player?

,RA1D3R_12,2008-03-27T07:30Z,"Hey there relentlesstech, is it possible for you to create an MP4/I-pod version of this collection? It would be great for the us handheld fans... 16 gigs is a little to big for the small machine... 

If not, season 5 and season 6 on MP4 would be great :]

or just 6... lol 

well, i hope u can consider...

thanks in advance and keep up the good work :]"

,CarlMemphis,2008-12-04T15:45Z,"There are several episodes missing, and the seasons are mixed up. 
Always consult IMDB before posting torrents with series."
