this is the official report of from the CENTRAL BANK authority in NORWAY to parliament for 2007.  page 17 shows documented proof that someone got paid 2 billion bucks for just holding the 300 billion, in 2007 alone.  transaction fees and taxes paid to foriegn governments are also surpress from the actual presented results to parliment.  page 17 specifically states these fees and taxes are not included in calculations as results would be drastically depressed.  someone has a really nice swiss bank account that the norwiegan CENTRAL BANK is hushing up about.
