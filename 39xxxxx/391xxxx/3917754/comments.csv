,AS1002MSB,2008-02-03T02:37Z,This is one of my favorite of torrents that you have created. I really appreciate your sharing Bazooka Joe - I've tried to find any information on the band that I could but always turn up with nothing. This is the first and last place I have heard of this phenominal band and I hope more people download it.
