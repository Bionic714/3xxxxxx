,Benjic,2007-11-29T03:14Z,"Mine still says 14 days left, is that normal?"
,vaporATX,2007-11-29T03:23Z,The 250 icon limit is still being enforced. Useless. 
,al12gether,2007-11-29T14:52Z,"works fine!
thank you, kea75!"
,vaporATX,2007-11-29T15:56Z,No it doesn't. With the icon limit still in place it is useless.
,xpander,2007-11-29T16:00Z,"Does NOT work fine. 250 icon limit is in effect if you try to add icons, and if you track prefs file, you will see that 14 day limit is also in effect. Hopefully 3rd time will be a charm."
,vaporATX,2007-11-29T17:05Z,I've just gave up on it for the time being and and wrote an Apple script to change my system icons. Or you can use the Liteicon beta which seems to work fine as long as you flush the icon caches and login/logout after applying. I'm pretty sick of Panic right now. I actually bitched and moaned so much about the upgrade cost that they got sick of arguing with me and refunded the $13 I paid for CB2. :) 
,Benjic,2007-11-30T04:21Z,"Yea, its way to hard to find good cracked software on mac os, I just bought cb3."
,aconk,2007-11-30T21:18Z,"SN: 676A-CATA-NQCA-W69N-ACAQ-T

Note: REMEMBER TO USE LITTLE SNITCH WHEN ENTERING THE SERIAL NUMBER

my method : allow port 88 for first time > candybar accept the SN just quit and open again just make it deny any connection..."
,vaporATX,2007-11-30T22:07Z,"That works. ;)

Thanks"
