MISSING Only Fools and Horses.S04E08-White Mice  (05 Mins)

Brief: Part of a BBC Breakfast Time Christmas Special, this rare clip shows Del 

explaining how to sell some White Mice to a 'Wally In A Hat'.

This has never been rereleased since, and remains another rare episode. If you got it,  

it's small. PLEASE UPLOAD it



Only Fools and Horses.S04E03-Hole in One


Brief: while filming the first episode, disaster struck, one of the central characters, 

Grandad had died. The challenge....to bury one of your central characters in a comedy.
 
It seemed impossible, but Sullivan pulled it off in a legendry way. Even though they 

had filmed the first episode with Grandad, Uncle Albert was introduced and the comedy 

maturely survived.
To this day the original Grandad episode, "Hole in one", has never been shown.


Only Fools and Horses.S04E09-To Hull and Back		(90 Min Film)

Brief: Just a simple courier job says Boycie and Abdul but the Trotter's life on the 

ocean wave doesn't go completely to plan. They run into their old friend Slater 'The 

Slag' but it isn't all plain sailing for him either.

Boycie and Abdul pitch a diamond scam to Del Boy, who immediately turns them down.
That is until they offer him a ┬ú15,000 cut of the estimated ┬ú150,000 sale of the stone 

on the UK market. Del finds himself designated as the courier between Holland and 

Britain.
No sooner has Del enlisted a reluctant Rodders, he hears his old foil Chief Inspector 

Slater is eyeing Boycie and Abdul as drug dealers. Del decides to hide undetected in 

the back of Denzil's van.
Denzil then getting in and driving them to Hull (pursued by Rodney) was not part of the 

plan. Thinking quickly, they hire a boat, and let Uncle Albert guide them to Amsterdam.
Overcoming counterfeit cash, Albert's amnesia, it's only the arrival of Slater that 

scuppers them. Despite this, it's Del who has the last laugh.
