,hotvette123,2007-12-04T00:38Z,i aint fishing for stupid comments..
[T],oddeven,2007-12-04T16:51Z,"Why don't you just click on the little red x and remove the other two torrents you aren't seeding, and at the same time remove the record of what you call stupid comments?"
,Avbryt,2007-12-05T19:16Z,theres no seeder why dont you seed hotvette?
,slumpy,2007-12-06T18:51Z,"I stand by my comments - there are now THREE fucking torrents by the same fucking person of the same fucking movie, AND NOT A SINGLE FUCKING ONE HAS MANAGED TO COMPLETE!

SOME FUCKING TRIBUTE!!"
[T],oddeven,2007-12-07T15:05Z,"and, after posting this one, where he says that he has clearly removed the other two (well, stopped seeding, not removed), he went directly to the other ones and didn't say anything other than ""one other thing don't download this if you dont want it, and bug someone else ok.."" 
  Nothing like ""I won't seed these files to the over one hundred people who have been waiting patiently for three weeks.""
Other than calling people who are annoyed by this a fanny, all he appears to have done is wasted a heck of a lot of bandwidth.
What is actually the point of even starting to seed something (which is already posted) and then state that it will take a lifetime to get this file?
I suspect that most of the suckers who are still trying to download this have found the torrent from some other site, and are missing out on this wonderful ""tribute"" and just think that ""CONTROL IAN CURTIS AVI [NOT CONVERTED ]"" and ""control joy division 2007 movie [the genuine thing]"" sound clear enough that they don't need to surf over to here to find out what hotvette actually has in store for them.

Thanks a lot, hotvette, for keeping this conversation going.  You certainly have a lot of patience.

I still like the connection to Riverdance..."
