@istrebitel:  What the fuck is the relation between acupressure and Swineflu!? You believe in that american I-want-to-sale-my-tamiflu-shit!?  I dont trust homepages where you can read lies like that...
You do, so you are an complete idiot."
,avanover,2010-07-29T21:30Z,"@istrebitjel You say that because you don't understand acupuncture and acupressure. There are many phenomena in this universe which occur and science has not yet been able to explain, yet they still occur. Would it be justifiable to say that they don't just because science has not yet verified it? As a self-educated person; I can tell you that acupuncture works as such: Your body processes many chemical reactions 24/7 and each of these leaves behind an almost minute amount residual electrical charge. As a result, your body is left with a pool of electrical charge. Naturally, the body will cause itself to go into equilibrium (homeostasis). If the distribution of electrical charge is unbalanced then your body will produce a loss of function with various organs and pain in the muscular/skeletal system (because the body is trying to balance itself). Acupuncture finds points where electrical charge is being blocked, thus being stopped from being distributed evenly, and gradually removes these blockages. All of our bodies are different and sometimes treatment may take longer for some; it just depends on how our bodies respond to the process. Medicine (drugs) actually do a similar thing but instead of just gradually balancing the system; drugs counterbalance (which is a general reason why they have side effects)."
