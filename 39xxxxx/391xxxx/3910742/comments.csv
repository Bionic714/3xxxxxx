,Lsnake,2007-11-27T08:32Z,"Bless you for this, it's just a shame that Score fans are treated like crap. Instead we get all those ""Various B artists who got nothing to do with the movie"" album. Spiderman 3 is one of the best scores I've heard in an action movie for years, so get on with it and release the damn score. Thank you for the effort, appreciated. "
