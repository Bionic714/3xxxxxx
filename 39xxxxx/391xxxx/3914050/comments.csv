,mamk,2007-12-02T22:07Z,seed?
,sammysung,2007-12-03T09:05Z,"well it's averaging 38kbps for the past 48 hours so it's getting there, slowly but surely. 

As soon as a few others have it, then things will get faster still.

As you can see - 2 seeders, both me, and 132+ leeches - it WILL improve soon :)"
,DannOrly,2007-12-04T04:09Z,"You do realize that there have been about 10 others, including myself, who have uploaded these exact files in the same fashion as you, right? Ah well, to each their own."
