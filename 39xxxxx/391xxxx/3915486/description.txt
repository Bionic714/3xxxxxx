Anatomize is the third and most recent album by instrumental group Thanatopsis, featuring Buckethead, Travis Dickerson and Ramy Antoun. This album strayed away from the more somber tones of Axiology and had a sound more like the first Thanatopsis album, mixed with influences from the Buckethead album Population Override (which Travis Dickerson also played on), while still retaining the identity that Axiology had brought with it.
