Missing In Pakistan

Independently produced documentary about the abduction and illegal detention of Pakistani citizens by Pakistani intelligence agencies. The film is circulating informally among concerned citizens in Pakistan as the subject is too hot for commercial channels. This is truth-telling at its bravest, unflinching best.

Who made this film?
The first frame credits a producer but given the explosive nature of the document and the state of fear in the country, there is serious doubt as to whether the persons real name was used. There are rumours that it was produced in Karachi, but this has not been confirmed.

When was it made?
Again, no information came with the file. All we know, judging from the events depicted in the film, is that it was produced at least three months after March 9th, 2007 and before the landmark decision over-turning the ex-officio status of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry.
