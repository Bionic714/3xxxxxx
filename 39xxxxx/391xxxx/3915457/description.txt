All of these tracks except one (Oh Happy Day) were digitized from Original LP. Oh Happy Day was digitized from cassette tape. LP transfers were put through an EQ to reverse RIAA, and treated with click, crackle and noise filters (in that order). Unfortunately, one track (How Great Thou Art) has a scratch through the second verse and chorus that I was unable to take out.
