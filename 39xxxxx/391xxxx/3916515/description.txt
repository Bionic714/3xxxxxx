
From the Bullshit007 treasure chest:

This is a repertoire for Black. Forget those over-analyzed lines of the Winawer and Classical French that are now at virtual saturation point. Today?s treatment of the McCutcheon (1.e4 e6 2.d5 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4) guarantees uncompromising positions, perfectly tailored to playing for a win with Black. IM Andrew Martin presents the original ideas of the modern McCutcheon 1.e4 e6 2.d5 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4.
