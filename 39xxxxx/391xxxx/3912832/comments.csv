,richard6,2007-11-29T03:52Z,"This is Nod32 v2.70.16, not the latest version!"
,bentrader,2007-11-29T05:45Z,"nice and easy fix. works, get latest signature database.  Scanned with Kaspersky, Trend Micro,  and NOD 32 V3 (on anohter pc), yeah, clean, no virus. 

it would be nice to have a fix for V3.

,bentrader,2007-11-30T04:57Z,"well, most other V3 fix not really working like this one,  user/pass quickly banned and have to keep using new user/pass from nod321.com to get signature databse updated. 

This is such a nice lifetime fix for V2.7! what about a fix like this for V3? "
,bentrader,2007-11-30T07:09Z,"there is one with complete steps of fix for V3.

,bentrader,2007-12-05T05:56Z,"so far the best fix for NOD32, two clicks away, and life time. other V3 fix still not good enough."
,pbdude069,2007-12-17T04:06Z,"Works Perfect, not as pretty as V3 but is so much easier just install(without restarting) then use""Fix"".
It even tells you u have 16715202 days left of the trial or some crazy number! Thanks alot"
,bentrader,2008-01-01T02:51Z,"the best fix for NOD32 so far, as nothing really working for V3."
,bentrader,2008-01-12T23:27Z,"finally a great fix for V3:
