I only upload complete seasons. Peace!"
,EuphoricDissonance,2008-01-08T23:37Z,"Awesome upload! And on the lines of Comedy Central shows with short lifespans, I don't suppose you know where I can find Straight Plan for the Gay Man? I'm pretty sure they only aired three episodes, but I thought those episodes were a riot."
,EastCoastBoy,2008-06-01T14:13Z,"Too bad the version of ""Safari Day"" here doesn't have the original ""Porn For Kids"" segment, but I guess that's OK.  It would've been nice though to have had those kids shout ""WE WANT PORN!  YEAAAHH!"" from that."
