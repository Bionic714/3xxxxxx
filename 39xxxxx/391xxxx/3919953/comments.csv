,Tiny Turtle ,2007-12-04T18:36Z,"Seriously, a typical DVD movie is 6+ GB in size so either you shrunk it to 2.9 GB (and then it's not ""untouched"") or this is just a big hoax."
,surtan,2007-12-04T18:57Z,"Tiny, I agree totally with you. I used a new cloner and wonder what happend, so I burned down the files myself, and I can't see any changes in video quality. I have no intensions of put up shrinked movies - others do that, and that's ok for some people. I sincerely hope that this torrent should be just as fine in your player, as in mine, otherwise i'm very sorry."
,Tiny Turtle ,2007-12-04T19:12Z,"""not seeing any difference in video quality"" and untouched ain't exactly the same. What ""cloner"" did you use, what's the source material (i.e. Nordic 2-disc retail or 1-disc rental) and how much extra material did you rip out?"
,surtan,2007-12-04T21:26Z,"I use DVD-Cloner 5, cause it work with Vista - I've got some trouble with my other program.
This one gives me some other problems, obviousely, and shrink the movie more than it has to. I've rip all extras and a couple of soundfiles from a 1-disc rental DVD, but I have to shrink the movie as well to fit 4,7G (DVDR).

I will be careful with the word ""untoucht"" from now on...

I will not seed this torrent anymore, but I put up one in 4,6G instead.

To the 27 downloaders of this torrent, I can only say I'm sorry, but I will not seed this torrent anymore.

It's a major f-ck up of me, and thank's to TT who let me know.

No one gets rich by putting up torrents at TPB, this is a unique sharing and helping among peoples wordwide. Let's keep it going!"
