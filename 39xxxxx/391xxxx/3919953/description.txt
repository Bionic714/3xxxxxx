Not a new one, but I just love this movie, so for those who don\'t have it, here it is!

When a sudden attack by a French warship inflicts casualities and severe damage upon his vessel, Captain \"Lucky\" Jack Aubrey (Crowe) of the British Royal Navy is torn between duty and friendship as he embarks on a thrilling, high-stakes chase across two oceans to intercept and capture the enemy at any cost. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture! 

I don\'t like bad copies of movies, so I always presents my torrents as:

Video untoucht
Audio 5.1 DD. 
Subs in all 4 nordic language plus eng. 


Enjoy!
