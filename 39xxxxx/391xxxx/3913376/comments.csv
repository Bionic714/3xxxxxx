,desipirate09,2007-11-29T00:48Z,can someone confirm that this is clean?
,solito77,2007-11-29T01:04Z,"its clean and working, Thanks.
asking for 29 serial.
You need install as trail first.
after crack work perfect"
,kizo973,2007-11-29T01:31Z,"Works great, tnx m8.

(hint, manually create path C:\Program Files\Diskeeper Corporation\Diskeeper and install there, follow the instructions and will work like charm)."
,pizoknowsall,2007-11-29T01:33Z,thanks bro!
,kizo973,2007-11-29T04:06Z,"1. You must be loged in windows as administrator
2. Dont just shut down old version, uninsall it from system, then use some registry cleaner (not necesary but can help to get rid of some old keys from previous version), now create path: Diskeeper Corporation\Diskeeper in: C:\Program Files, install following the instructions provided by uploader.  
Good Luck!"
,kizo973,2007-11-29T15:00Z,"Its even better :)

,MotoFast,2007-11-30T16:52Z,Upgrade to Utorrent 1.75.
,kizo973,2007-11-30T16:55Z,"I just now redownloaded torrent to see if there is some error, down speed over 200kb prowe that there is enough seeders.
Maybe is time for you to upgrade your utorrent 1.6.1 to last stable version 1.7.5 (build 4602).
Good luck!"

,SCORPION2000,2007-12-05T02:42Z,"Use:
Start menu, Run, (type in:)-> services.msc , right click on Diskeeper and start."
,JanZ,2007-12-05T20:36Z,That is how I already tried to restart it...
,kizo973,2007-12-06T01:04Z,"You should have this hotfix:

http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=839174

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;886695

And make sure firewall is not blocking diskeeper service which use loopback 127.0.0.1.

Good Luck!

Thanks for the tip there SERGEDLM...

Obviously this is an issue with 64 bit Vista and XP and not a problem related to not being able to read instructions.

Thanks though...!"
,4558845,2007-12-20T03:24Z,"This worked perfectly the first time on Vista Ultimate 32-Bit! Just be a little intuitive during installing and you'll be fine.

1) Run installer, install as trial (no license file)
2) Stop Diskeeper service (start > run > services.msc)
3) Copy tab.dll and license.dal to \Program Files\Diskeeper Corporation\Diskeeper
4) Start Diskeeper service (start > run > services.msc)"
,spammersonny,2007-12-21T02:11Z,Is this able to update itself? Or do updates not work?

,Euphoria954,2008-01-11T01:49Z,"GREAT WORK!  I already had Diskeeper Pro Premier installed (that was ""SUPPOSEDLY"" cracked) and it kept nagging me to activate.

I simply used the procedure outlined in the notes, disabling the service, copying the dll and dal files, re-enabled the service, and voila!  No more license worries!  :)

THANKS SemTHeX!"

,DocHoliday23,2008-01-16T19:06Z,"This Works Perfectly.  Just find the liscence.dal file in the crack folder.  In order for it to work for me on Vista I had to put it in the dir: Windows/programfiles/diskeepercorp/diskeeper
...and also put it in the 1033 file as well.  This is located in dir:windows/programfiles/diskeepercorp/diskeeper/1033  hope this helps."

,iammoph,2008-01-22T09:20Z,"I dont know if anyone else had this problem but i have spent the last several hours trying to figure it out and i finally got it and wanted to share *just in case*
when i would try to run DK i got an error saying 
the microsoft management console had to shut down. i downloaded updates, patches, etc but finally found this:

it was tied to an obscure 
regional setting. If you go to the control panel > regional and 
language options > customize > click on the 'Digit grouping' option 
and change it from 123456789 to 123,456,789. 

Worked like a charm!
Now, i can say thank you!"

,_theo_,2008-02-02T21:49Z,"I have a 64 bit processor, a 64 bit board, 32 bit xpPRO. Installed as follows:

1. Install Diskeeper
2. Stop Diskeeper service \""DkService.exe\"" 
   ( Start menu, Run -> services.msc , right clic on Diskeeper, stop service)
3. Copy License.dal file in the Diskeeper directory
    Replace Tab.dll file with the cracked .dll
   ( By default \""C:\\Program Files\\Diskeeper Corporation\\Diskeeper\\\"" )
4. Restart Diskeeper service
5. iNJoY

N.B: If Diskeeper ask for Activation, Cancel or select \'Never Activate\', and you no see more nag .

~~~~~~~~here is how my install went.......
##########################################

a. once you decompress the RAR files you will find 2 more RARs inside. you only need the first one...[part1]. decompress it. 

b. double click to it to install. *don't input or point to licensees just select ""i downloaded it"". 

c. continue install. select ""don't ever update"" 

d. Stop service :: see 2. above

e. copy tab.dll and license.dal to location in (step 3 above) you can also drag and drop there but whatever.

f. restart service :: see 2. above [replace ""stop"" with ""start""]


g. Going back to the downloaded folder, i found that autorun.exe was added to the folder...i deleted this for although its creation date is 9-7-2007...it was not there before the install. If you want to create an installation CD, you can use autorun.inf to autostart the install process. 2/2/2008"

Thank you very much, to the crazy elite programmers who do this.

the installation was very complicated though, but thanks to Theo's helpful comment and some winging, it installed successfully.

no virus.

[T],FatFreddy475,2008-06-21T05:21Z,"Don't listen to _theo_ he doesn't know what he's talking about. YOU WILL NEED PART 2 of the extracted rar file unless it wont work!!! (He obviously doesn't know how .rar files work)

Also, ""don't input or point to licensees just select ""i downloaded it"". "" is bullshit. You will need to point to the .dal file after you chose the option 'you downloaded this'.

""a 64 bit board""
You mean you have a motherboard that fits your 64bit processor? A motherboard is not either 32bit or 64bit, it's dependant of what socket the motherboard support. Irellevant information m8. Do you also have a usb mouse that fits into a usb port too? smart!"
