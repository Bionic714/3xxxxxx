,rev.godless,2009-03-26T03:50Z,"dudes, I'm stuck so close to the end, I have 99.73% of this... please, seed that last touch! Please please please."
,candiria,2011-03-03T02:56Z," For anyone reading this today:
 Whether your Wii is hard or soft modded, burn this ISO to a disc. I used ImgBurn at 2x and it worked perfectly from the Disc Channel.
 This was, of course, after a month solid of downloading every form of this game offered, PAL and NTSC, scrubbed and full ISO, the alternate boot .dol method using WiiScrubber to extract rename and replace, the results were the same across the board....Controllers screen then the Wii would reboot.
 Oddly enough, the idea of burning to a blank DVD never donned on me, then I did it and now I'm playing MK:A.

 Hope this helps."

,anubisavi,2012-03-11T09:52Z,"Now to those who have the following problem: You have game burned on disk but when you put it into your Wii,  the black screen appears right after telling you which controllers you can use to play this game. And your wii freezes until you do not unplug it and restart it. Here is the solution:
Download iospatcher 1.1 and patch the iso file. Do the following steps:
1. Download and extract ios patcher somewhere on your pc
2. Right click on the Mortal Kombat iso and choose 'Open with', then browse to the folder where you extracted the ios patcher and then choose the iospatcher exe file.
3. Click open and the iospatcher will open in a dos window. It should detect the ios stored in the iso, mine was ios 19(yours will be different but it is ok). And it will ask you which ios to patch your iso. Write 249 and press enter. You should get a text telling you the patch was successfully. Only after that burn your disk and the game will work flawlessly on your WII
Enjoy"
