,ReijiMaigo,2008-06-11T01:52Z,Not a big fan of .pdf format. Any way to reformat into something more common (.png or .jpg for example)?
,Refrigerardo,2008-09-19T15:57Z,"Holy Crap!!!!

you have no idea what you've done for me compiling all this material!

i'll be sure to die happy after reading all this!

i'll super seed it to a ratio of 10 before backing it up on dvd. Thank again man, you are my hero after hal jordan dude!"
,SeraphicX,2008-10-29T19:29Z,"I will be seeding this for as long as I can, whenever I can. Great up."
,Mysteryfanboy,2009-06-03T22:10Z,"Wow! And in PDF no less! The PDF format is a universe better from that awful CBR format, and i've been converting them to pdf for myself all along. for the non-Adobe Acrobat users, grab the free Acrobat Reader: you'll be glad you did.
Many, many thanks!"
