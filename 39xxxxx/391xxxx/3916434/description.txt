The original CD from PKR, version 1.30 (November 2007).
Bundled with Documentation, Videos, Mobile Ringtones and PKRCast!

You must install latest version of wine in order to run PKRInstall.exe (Live Poker Simulator) or SetupCasino.exe

I have tested this games under Ubuntu 7.10 + WINE 0.9.50

The PKRCasino work perfectly, but for PKR Poker you need to obtain latest drivers for your nVideo card.


Below the description for PKR Poker.
