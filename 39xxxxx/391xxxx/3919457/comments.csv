Does it install properly?  Cracks/keygens etc?"

,kunnoichi,2008-05-06T05:52Z,Ok well with 42 seeders  I dont think they all are having problems with the game not working roperly (I hope) going to ty it since anything with deviance hasnt faile me yet and will let you folks know
,kunnoichi,2008-05-09T03:58Z,Seems to be working perfectly. Nottice the birth/death and growth is a bit messed up but that could also be my fault and they are lacking food lol will post further as I know of it    thank you so much for the DL :)
,kunnoichi,2008-05-09T22:11Z,Ok final comment. Game works 100% perfectly. Only drawback is the lazy mouse. Friend has the same but we are on vista that could be why.

,Liptonn,2008-05-18T02:21Z,PLEASE SEED ! really want this game :)
,Quirky_Puppy,2008-05-22T18:44Z,"THIS IS NOT A WIND UP, READ CAREFULLY.

This is fully verifiable if you check any of the B&W2 forums like planetblack&white.

There is some very careful coding built into this game that the deviance crackers appear to have missed. 

While the game will run and is playable your children will NOT age if the original disk is not in the drive.

While you can get most of the way throught the game (I'm on island 5 or 6 I think) you won't be able to finish it. You can get a certain amount of population from immigration but later in the game where resources are too scarce to make such an impressive city you're truly stuffed!

If you have any doubts, check the forums for this problem, or try playing the game. I'm not saying don't download it, just that you will be dissapointed eventually!"
,Quirky_Puppy,2008-05-23T13:01Z,"I've found a fix for the children problem.

Don't bother using the crack supplied in this download, it doesn't work properly. 

Instead, grab the crack from gamecopyworld.com, I used the fixed .exe AND the mini image just to be on the safe side."

,hans0402,2008-06-22T12:48Z,"I mounted it all and the installation worked fine, but if I try to start the game (the screen shows up where you have to choose Play, Remove and so on) I choose Play, but I simply can't click it... If I press enter the screen disappears and nothing happens.... "

Same problem, i got an ati GPU so it's not your nvidia GPU causing the problem, anyone has got a solution for this?"
,northernstrike,2009-01-05T14:35Z,"sqz95 

you need to extract the rar files to a location

ex. c/programs or some place you remember use daemon tools to mount the files 

(right klick at daemon then click at the top of it then it says mount or something and you can search for a file when you find this file select it and then press mount and the installation comes up

crack it (open the disk from this computer and then right click at the black and white 2 icon open and then look for a ""crack"" file inside this file you find 1-3 files usaly 1 dll file and one black and white 2 icon file select these 2 files copy them and then paste them in the installation directory"
,northernstrike,2009-01-05T14:37Z,"if you dont have daemon download at

filehippo.com andi n the  aoudio and  vidoe list you find it =)"

,Totalanihilation,2010-01-12T22:20Z,"I can confirm that the crack included with the game DOES prevent your villagers from aging, which may sound good, but is actually very bad. At one point in time I had over 400 children all stuck at 1 year old, and only 20 or so villagers.

I downloaded the crack from GameCopyWorld.com (Black and White 2 v1.2 DVD English Fixed) and now my villagers age properly. I suggest downloading the new crack or the game will be very difficult to play."

As for the game, got it installed and it started. But I get the the LionHead Studios screen( where the beads can move, and you can scoop them.) Once I get there it just stays there. No keys skip it, clicking your mouse just causes the logo to move about. No idea whats wrong. Any help?"
