,tmc80tmc,2008-02-20T12:41Z,"Can someone tell me HOW the heck you can get past the Solar Return Machine puzzle if the background screen is corrupt? You have to move 6 dials in the correct order with no frame of reference.. talk about trying to crack a safe blind and deaf... any help would be appreciated.
