,venom279,2007-12-18T07:42Z,"Did you run into any problem while running the game? I downloaded the files and started the game fine, but it freezes during the animation while I was in the forest area in disc 1. I rebooted the game 2x and it freezes at the same point during the animation. Can you plz check it out? Thank you."
,neogaidenx,2007-12-21T08:05Z,mines running fine just lagging a bit cause its compressed.. anyways i maybe putting the uncompressed xenogears
,neogaidenx,2007-12-21T08:06Z,maybe u need to run it with popsloader plugin
,shankytown,2008-08-07T08:53Z,"sweeeeeeet it's still alive
thanks, neogaidenx

i'll seed as far as my bandwidth allows... :D"
,squidney2k1,2008-09-15T23:37Z,"Runs fine for me except a little laggy since it's pretty compressed.

I'm running 4.01 M33, but use popsloader 3.71 (Hold R + X on start-up if you're not sure) as just about any other setting will cause freezing and crashing.

This should be a multi-dsic Eboot. Awesome game!"
,lookin4xeno,2008-10-17T22:24Z,"Hey guys, I downloaded this torrent twice, and in both times in different settings, this torrent DID NOT WORK! At first I just had the early custom firmware (like 3.50), from Dark_Alex (it had popsloader in it from the firmware). I downloaded the torrent and played CD1, and after the opening scene when the village is attacked, and it goes into the first battle mode, it hangs!! So I downgraded, and then upgraded again, but this time I put 4.01 M33 (from again Dark_Alex.. muchas gracias senor!!), 4.XX kernel, and the highest popsloader I could get online (higher than 3.71 for sure). After upgrading the firmware all day, I erased the original download, and downloaded the torrent the second time. It still hangs in the same spot.

I'm beginning to think this torrent is not good, but I also feel I may be doing something wrong, though I cant imagine what it is. I'm running this on a PSP fat, so what am I doing wrong? Can I get Xeno from some other site?"
,Skyfallaks,2008-11-09T15:29Z,"It's slow for some people? It's running fine for me, music's playing fast and can't really tell any difference in the visuals.

And yeah on any other pops version than 3.71 I didn't get past the first scene, but on 3.71 I'm nearing the second disc."
,DoUFolksLikCoffe,2008-12-08T02:16Z,"Hey there lookin4xeno, sounds like you need the popsloader that allows you to run the game on any CFW you need to in order to run the game without upgrading or down grading, basically its every version for the sony ps1 emu in one. If you run into problems doing this(or you've already done it) heres a helpful link that will tell you what CFW you need to run it perfectly.

,neogaidenx,2010-03-24T16:51Z,"I've made a homebrew emulator for the xenogears itself, trying to surpass the spin on deus.. releasing it soon hopefully. maybe i'll integrate it as an eboot too."
