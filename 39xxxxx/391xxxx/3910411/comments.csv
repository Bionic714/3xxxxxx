Using SUBTITLES with ""CCCP"" and the following Media Player Classic, Warning: donÂ´t change any names in the folder. If you do, Sub won't work. Start the movie, You will find a green arrow at the desktop screen very long down in the right corner(DirectVobSub),right click on it,          here - change or hide subtitles. Enjoy this movie with the sub you whished!
