,tjac1999,2007-12-08T22:58Z,"Tracker says there are 2 seeders, earlier it said there were 4 seeders.  Either the tracker is NFG or people who have gotten 100% have disappeared.  The torrent only occasionally has one single seeder and most of the time no seeders.   If you have received 100% stick around and seed it for the rest of the people who want this torrent.  Over 400 leechers and no seeders, that's NUTS!!!!!"
,oddbod,2007-12-09T13:44Z,"Im still seeding ..... and will continue to do so till more seeds stay on it.

And to the low life hit and runners ...... May god have mercy on your soul !

,oddbod,2007-12-11T18:18Z,"I just sat and watched 5 people complete on this file and then drop out ????????

So it means IM back seeding ALONE again !

Unfortunatlly i need to stop seeding this for now so blame the ***t's that hit and ran it if you didnt get it all yet.

But there is someone of us that wants this and wants to seed :) There is now 29 seeders at 99,5% so i hope u get online for us to cover the last 0,5%. best regards mini_me."

,tjac1999,2007-12-12T19:34Z,"Thanks to all of you who seeded this!

To those of you who leeched and ran, shame on you!!  Hopefully one day you'll get about 90% of something you really want and all seeders will disappear  -  then you'll understand and know you deserved it.

Thanks oddbod for the torrent and the patience."

,godursadreadingthis,2008-01-04T13:29Z,"k i've been online for ages trying to find anything to help me, does anyone know if i can downgrade my firmware from 3.52 so i can start using custom firmware, and then start using these."
,elyk1212,2008-01-07T19:06Z,"Hey, godursadreadingthis,

Just read about Pandora's battery hack.  It is easy to do, but you need to have a PSP fat around with a PSP fat battery (borrow a friend, if you don't have a fat?).

Anyway, you just need to google about it. You end up needing:
-memory card 
-fat battery
-Fat PSP. 
-Firmware you are upgrading to
-Pandor-izing software

Then you change the battery into service mode using software provided in many tutorials, and condition the memory card to load a firmware flasher as it's first instruction.

Pls Read about it, I didn't memorize the details.  There are probably a dozen tutorials and forums on this topic."

Introduktion:
PSP är som de flesta vet en portabel spel maskin men den kan bli så mycket mer om man har custom firmware, även kallat CFW.
Då kanske du nu undrar hur du får CFW, innan 3.51 så fanns det en massa exploits som man kunde använda men från och med 3.51
så måste du använda ett så kallat pandora kit för att byta till CFW.
Ett pandora kit består av ett vanligt psp (fat) batteri som man ha bytt serienummer till 0xFFFFFFFF så att det blir ett så kallat servicebatteri.
Med hjälp utan detta batteri så får man pspn att ladda filer från minneskortet istället för internminnet.
Du kan istället för att göra ett eget pandora kit lämna in din psp till psxcare för en liten peng.
När du har uppdaterat din CFW så kan det vara bra att återställa inställningarna via recovery mode."
