"Undercover Mosque is a documentary from British Television Channel 4 programme Dispatches which aired on 15 January 2007 in the UK. The film caused a furor in Britain and the world press due to the content of the released footage. The documentary presents film footage gathered from 12 months of secret investigation into mosques throughout Britain. West Midlands Police investigated whether criminal offences had been committed by those teaching or preaching at the Mosques and other establishments. They presented their evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service who advised that â??a realistic prospect of a conviction was unlikelyâ??. The West Midlands Police then complained to Ofcom that the programme amounted to misrepresentation. Ofcom also received complaints from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and from the London Central Mosque.

The resulting complaints to Ofcom were rejected on 19th November 2007. "Undercover Mosque was a legitimate investigation...the broadcaster had accurately represented the material it had gathered and dealt with the subject matter responsibly and in context.""
