,Onk,2007-12-01T21:10Z,"Thanks to the uploader for this.

winkydink: As an American, you should be able to read that it was made by Channel 4, not the BBC. :)"
,Ibwaheemi,2008-02-06T19:47Z,"the metropolitan police wanted to press charges against channel 4 for airing this deceit.

no muslim preecher was ever charged over this but i think they made there own lawsuits against channel4.  one cleric offered a reward of ÂŁ1000 on radio ikhlas (derby)  to anyone if they could prove it to be true.  

go on censor claim your grand (you fool, get you crap straight) and quit reading the sun newspaper"
,Ibwaheemi,2008-02-06T19:52Z,"the police investigated initially because they wanted to press charges against the muslims involved.

when the police saw the unedited footage the wanted the charge channel 4 instead. 

This is as factual as J.F.K."
,Ibwaheemi,2008-02-06T19:54Z,"Muslims are portrayed in a better light in the New York Times.

at least the NYT is just selectively edited this doc is just lies"
,FenixII,2008-02-21T16:24Z,"Yeah, the police did investigate Ch4, and they found that the docu had not been edited in a dishonest way, quite the contrary. This is a legitimate document.

,Wake_Up.,2008-10-24T14:41Z,"This is Islam. What Muslims are doing in Darfur.

Halima Bashir is a survivor. She was tortured and gang-raped for days as a punishment for speaking out about an attack on primary school children in Darfur.

Her crime was to tell people that a group of Janjaweed militia and government soldiers had attacked the primary school for girls, raping pupils as young as eight. She paid a terrible personal price.

""They were aged between 8 and 13,"" she said. ""They were in shock, bleeding, screaming and crying. It was horrific. Because I told people what happened, the authorities arrested me. They said, 'We will show you what rape is'. They beat me severely. At night, three men raped me.
""The following day the same thing, different men. Torture and rape, every day, torture and rape.""

In five 5 cases, women described that the rapists abducted them and held them captive for several days and during that period they were raped regularly by several men. One woman reported that her abduction lasted 6 days and she was raped by 10 men.

?I was returning from the market, that day. I was walking with a group of nine women and two men. We met some armed men along the road. They took the nine women and held us under a tree in their camp. They released us after three days. During all this time, I was raped every night and every day by five men.?
Among the nine women, only three came to the clinic, among which two girls were 12 and 13 years old. 

The women and girls fall victim to rape as they collect firewood outside the refugee camps. Many have been gang-raped in front of their families as the conquering Janjaweed militia burnt down their homes.

Seven women pooled money to rent a donkey and cart, then ventured out of the refugee camp to gather firewood, hoping to sell it for cash to feed their families. Instead, they say, in a wooded area just a few hours walk away, they were gang-raped, beaten and robbed.

Naked and devastated, they fled back to Kalma.
""All the time it lasted, I kept thinking: They're killing my baby, they're killing my baby,"" wailed Aisha, who was seven months pregnant at the time.

The worst case was that of a nine-year-old girl who had left the refugee encampment to gather grass for thatch and as fuel. A smiling man approached her and asked her to help him. She agreed, but as they moved further from the camp she told him her mother had told her not to wander so far.
Turning ugly, the man gagged her and tied her on top of the bundles of grass before raping her repeatedly. On release, she staggered back to the camp where Laird treated her for bleeding so severe that the child was unable to walk for many days afterwards.

In another case, an 11-year-old girl was raped by three armed men when she went to collect grass with her 7-year-old sister. The attack left her so badly injured she had to be evacuated by an African Union helicopter to the nearest hospital for treatment. 

""I am 16 years old. On day, in March 2004, I was collecting firewood for my family when three armed men on camels came and surrounded me. They held me down, tied my hands and raped me one after the other. When I arrive home, I told my family what happened. They threw me out of home and I had to build my own hut away from them. I was engaged to a man and I was so much looking forward to getting married. After I got raped, he did not want to marry me and broke off the engagement because he said that I was now disgraced and spoilt. It is the worse thing for me...
...When I was eight months pregnant from the rape, the police came to my hut and forced me with their guns to go to the police station. They asked me questions, so I told them that I had been raped. They told me that as I was not married, I will deliver this baby illegally. They beat me with a whip on the chest and back and put me in jail. There were other women in jail, who had the same story. During the day, we had to walk to the well four times a day to get the policemen water, clean and cook for them. At night, I was in a small cell with 23 other women. I had no other food than wh"
