My power company is having some power issues at the moment, so im having problems keeping my computer on.  You can reach me most of the time on irc.p2p-network.net on the channel #k1ngb0ng to see if the upload is working.
If anyone has any problems getting the install to work and you need help, get at me in the same place.
Have a nice day."

,pebster01,2007-12-14T11:27Z,"VIRUS! VIRUS!  VIRUS!  There is 5 viruses, mostly in the keygenerator i think but it could also be in the windows files itself. They are found with the use of ""F-secure"" antivirus.
"
,spm116,2007-12-14T22:50Z,"Delete the key generator on Install, you don't need it.  Also, it's flagged as a virus, but i cleaned the files.  They're blacklisted on many virus scanners simply because they are keygenerators."
,spm116,2007-12-14T22:50Z,"Aka, ignore that fool up there..
*looks up two posts*"
,pebster01,2007-12-16T17:03Z,"VIRUS! Sure i cleaned the files but why are they here in the first place? There are several key generators that doesnt give a virus alert. Why does this one gives virus alert unless there is something bad? I would never thrust a torrent like this. Why should I? A torrent that contains viruses is a bad torrent. period!
"
,mroizooizo,2007-12-17T12:29Z,A keygen is often seen as a virus by some scanners... so i'd say spm116 is correct...
,pebster01,2007-12-18T13:44Z,"I can not say if its really virus or not but here are the messages i get from my AV:

,spm116,2008-01-04T08:25Z,"I love how everyone is saying there is a virus, but nobody is getting the same ones as viruses or even the same number of them.  I WENT THROUGH EACH AND EVERY FILE AND HAND TESTED THEM, THERE ARE NO MORE REAL VIRUSES IN THE KEYS FOLDER.  By the way, I think that most of you saying that there are viruses in it were just doing research on it and saw that its full of viruses.

Don't listen to these n00bs, there are no viruses in this torrent.

Thank you."
,spm116,2008-01-04T08:27Z,"And thank you to people like mroizooizo, the rest of you, have a little faith, please.  Check your facts before you start bitching, and read up on your antivirus to see if it bitches about keygens.  F-secure, by the way, DOES."
