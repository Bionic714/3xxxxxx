Windows can not open this file."
,watchmanbr,2008-04-08T05:44Z,"BarbieRotten: you have to unrar it with WinRAR or (better) use a comic viewer, like CDisplay."

,asha23,2010-06-22T01:37Z,Why not buy these comics instead of downloading them. They are way better on paper and you'll be supporting the artists rather than stealing from them. It's not like they make a lot of money from this stuff.
,beautifulmassacre,2010-08-21T07:04Z,OMG!!! Thanks for this torrent I Love Love Love tank girl
