,Demonsoul98,2008-06-04T03:24Z,"I'm not quite done downloading, but so far this looks like a great Torrent. Nice to see a crapload more Seeders than Leechers."
,Tecseiyru,2008-07-20T17:45Z,"Please seed. 

I've been dying to get a Godsmack's discography. 

-Thanx-

Tec, Peace Out~"
,Ghis1964,2008-08-31T13:31Z,"yeah!!!!! I'm drunk, you have something like three comments, but this is kind of odd with all the seeds you got(118 for the time being). Very impressing.Not to mention Godsmack three album in all. But surprisingly, how did you get something like(if it were really 5 album)5GB on a little space such as this 383MB.
The problem is just that if you'v been really able to do such feeth,howcome you've only put such small description of them as this one ""A Godsmack Discography Torrent containing 5 albums""
But thats not your real problem. See, when some is saying he's got the stuff when he is not, I get bad vibes for his future.

In both ways, peace.

It's this amazing technology called compression. Perhaps you've heard of it? :) Mp3s dude, mp3s...
The entire 5 albums are indeed inside this torrent, in vbr high quality mp3 rips.

""See, when some is saying he's got the stuff when he is not, I get bad vibes for his future.""

Well, feel free to click on my nick dude; I didn't get my pirate flag for distributing bullshit."
,tntaces77,2009-01-10T22:24Z,awesome download thanx raidy 
,lokiklown,2009-03-10T19:50Z,lol @ Ghis1964 I would really like to know the bitrate of each of your audio tracks you rip to get 1 gig per album
,Valstein00,2009-03-25T23:07Z,"This torrent is perfect. All of the songs are whole, and of perfect quality. None of those crappy holes or blips in the music. The albums are all there in their entirety and theres no crappy live albums or random untitled albums full of unknown songs. Just the nice clean studio albums. Awesome. Highly recommended."
,drail34,2009-04-02T04:53Z,thanx for the torrent raidy...and for you others...stop your bitching. it's free for fuck sake!
,KiralyVlad,2009-06-12T02:54Z,"drail34 -> I totally agree. Just wasting time commenting crap.

raidy, thanks for this awesome torrent !"
,saidulhdz,2009-10-05T10:10Z,"@""raidy ""-
here's a piece of advice or more accurately an earnest request: as a pirate act like a pirate dude. If you can't figure out how to- then try to follow legends like ""aXXo"" or at least ""skirgsk"". Be a bit more informative; give us a hint on the album name, track list and if possible a bit of other interesting info like release date etc.

Anyway, Thanks for sharing such awesome content. keep up bro."
,switcha,2010-01-14T19:20Z,"thanks for the GS dude,bro,man"
[T],raidy,2011-01-18T04:32Z,"All ripped using EAC Secure Mode rip, encoded with lame v3.90.3 --alt-preset-standard, tagged, complete with sfv,nfo,m3u files. Enjoy.

Apologies for poor description. You can find full list of contents if you click ""Files"" at the top of this page."
