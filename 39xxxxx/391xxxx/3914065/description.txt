All of the software in this collection is found on the internet, either free for everyone or free for home users/non-commercial users.
  Depending on how many people seed this torrent, you may get a faster download speed by getting it directly from the site of origin (depending on 

the time of day) but I just wanted to try uploading my first torrent.
All of the files included in this torrent are the PC versions, and work on Windows XP. I have only tested them on XP, however they may work on 

older operating systems. Alternate versions (Mac, Linux, Unix, BSD, etc.) may be available on the websites listed.

Remember to update your software after installing it.
