,makapiapia,2007-11-27T04:34Z,Thank you very much.  We don't want to spend money for cable that is primarily full of crap.  Your downloads help limit the time we spend watching TV as well.  You are much appreciated.

Lots of comments about last weeks superior

Enjoy another beautiful one, or wait for

blocky motion and interlacing artifacts :)"

,theseus,2007-11-27T08:24Z,"You're the only one with that problem it seems. Try a virus scan or something. I've never seen a passworded release uploaded by He0n. His stuff is fine, as is this one."
,Markuuu,2007-11-27T08:36Z,Same here. Never had any problems with passwords...Are you downloading something else with maybe Rar files inside?
