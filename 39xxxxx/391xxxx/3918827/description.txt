*** DO NOT EXTRACT THE FILE ***


This is the ISO file for Starcraft: Broodwar for using a Virtual CD drive ( IE a no-cd crack ) Here is a link to the program to use it, it is called Deamon Tools. http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5

Download either or, I use the 64-bit version. All you must do is install Deamon tools, right click the little lighting icon in the taskbar and then click Vitrual CD/DVD-Rom > Device [I]: [I:] No media > Mount image. When it brings the box up, search for where you downlaoded the ISO to, and double click it, it will load up the Install and all you have to do is install it then play, no need to re-load the image unless you unload it. So enjoy, e-mail me at ParisWithMyLove@yahoo.com or if you are from the sniper forums PM me at DaMeiN. Enjoy.
