,grakgrak,2009-01-04T20:41Z,"Looks like I'm the only seed left for this torrent.

However, this is the 2nd Edition CD. The 3rd Edition came out in July 2008. If anyone can post that instead I'll seed it in place of this one."
,grakgrak,2009-02-19T17:46Z,"Why the fuck don't Irish ppl ever seed? I've seeded this for a year and more but every one of you parasites fuck off the second your dl is complete.

No more - I'm off."
