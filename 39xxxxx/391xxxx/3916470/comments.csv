You have to be more specific about your file uploads, that way more people will actually want to download it.

requirements:

Aspect Ratio, type, screenshots...of your file only...no downloaded substitutes...

These will help keep your downloaders happy..."

,Lolita85,2007-12-04T22:52Z,WTF is up with all the spanish on this site? Learn english!
,Ipyrat,2007-12-05T20:15Z,Settle down.TS just means Telesync no biggie.The reason there is alot of spanish is because Hollywood sends spanish versions to Mexico for review(dont know why no money there to see the movie).Mexico like Sweden is out of the reach of the MPAA.So even though they ruin the movie with shitty ass dubbing they cant get in trouble.California is also 90% spanish.
,Mongokino,2007-12-05T20:49Z,"Also theres the rest of the world, where other languages than english  are frequently spoken you dumb ignorant yanks. "

,danieljackson,2007-12-10T23:17Z,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telesync

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screener

They can be both a screener and a TS you dipshits pay attention before you claim someone is a liar"
,bunglex,2007-12-15T22:27Z,"OK. I dont know what wikipedia has written but a Screener is a pre-release copy (Usually DVD) that already has a digital audio track.
A telesync is when the audio is taken SEPERATELY from a direct (usually analogue) audio output of a an already printed film while the video is usually through a camera.
Even though technically you could you could separate the audio and video during copying of a Screener and then re-sync them up after it would be completely whacko! lol "

,midnightextreme,2007-12-23T01:29Z,STFU kajlin u homo
,mikesoft,2007-12-24T11:15Z,"lol @ all of you :) please comment on the quality, thanks."
,carpediem00,2007-12-26T23:35Z,"Audio 10/10 if you speak spanish and there are also spanish subs along with it i believe.

Video 5/10 blurry at times even in default resolution format.

Conclusion: Wait for a better quality to arrive if you have the patience.

Other thoughts....
   Why do people post seed this and seed that. People will seed if they want to. 
   If you have a low download rate get out from behind your firewall or have it make exceptions or else you cant complain.
   And why do people play point fingers and the blame game at other people err i mean total strangers on piratebay forums? 

    Grow up its all free if you dont like something about what you downloaded change it and upload it. Take control to make the necessary changes.

    Ive been a user since torrents existed and there is no reason to complain especially if you understand how to handle the torrents."
