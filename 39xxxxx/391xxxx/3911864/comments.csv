,Hubird,2008-09-13T08:50Z,"Bad Dreams is missing the last 2 tracks (Can't find them any where)

Monsters In The Closet, some files are not proper mp3's. I can not tag them with mp3 tag or open them with goldwave. They might not play properly on portable / car players  and might not convert to CD properly.

The files in question come up with the error:

No MPEG header found in file.

Most of these can be found using frostwire...."
