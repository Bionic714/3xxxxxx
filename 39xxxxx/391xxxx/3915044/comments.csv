,david666,2007-12-04T16:16Z,Det går sakta men säkert! Bra att du seedar taikonaut. Jag har ca 12.7% nu. Hur mycket upstream har du?
,david666,2007-12-10T07:57Z,32.1%! saakta men säkert :)
,taikonaut,2007-12-15T15:18Z,"Jag är ledsen för den långsama hastigheten. Jag skall dela denna så länge jag kan. På nätterna stänger jag av datorn och sätter på den vid 11 tiden på dagen för att gå varm till på kvällen. Hoppas ni har överseende.

,iPwn_1994,2009-01-08T14:28Z,"Tackar, Taikonaut! Otroligt att det fortfarande funkar att ladda ner, eftersom du la upp den 07-11-30. Den går antingen mellan 80-200 eller 300-600 kb/s. Tack! Ska rekommendera dig till VIP på forumen. Tack!"

,EeijiT,2009-02-13T15:17Z,"Aniluap: Testa Media Player Classic.

Tanka och installera detta. Det är ett gäng codecs och både Media Player Classic och Zoom Player följer med."

,Donderjager,2009-10-03T19:06Z,I'm trying to convert these files to iPod format(s) but i keep getting I/O error. Never encountered this before. Does anyone know how to solve this ?
,veronicamars.thebest,2009-10-04T10:19Z,"pleeees seed!!! i love this show but it takes almost 2 hours to download one episode, it is only 11 of 112 that are seeding, so pleese seed!!!"
,hentooth,2010-01-05T20:55Z,"Wow, this is taking some downloading, and being nagged by the wife all the way to see if it's done yet.

I'm at 99.9% and will seed until my torrent client gets too cluttered, which is normally 2 weeks (or if not, the client is set to cut off at 3000% upload).
"
[T],Robston,2010-04-09T09:46Z,"Many thanks. Flawless playback so far. I'll leave this in my seedbox to boost seeding.

This was hidden away on cable TV in the UK so I missed it. No release on R2 DVD either. Really enjoying it so far. A little gem. 
"
,le2k8,2010-04-28T18:22Z,"@Robston  go to E4 to watch it 4-5pm
