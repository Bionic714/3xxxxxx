Thats right. Giant Leeches. This movie really sucks.(Pun Intended) It is definitely NOT a classic. Everything from lousy dialog, horrible acting to even worse "Effects".  From Executive Producer Roger Corman. This is a fun way to waste an hour if there is nothing else on TV. For a good time, watch it at 4:20.
