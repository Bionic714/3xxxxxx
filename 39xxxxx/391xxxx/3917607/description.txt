VICTOR VICTORIA - 1982

  Julie Andrews plays a pennieless singer in 1930's Paris who becomes the toast of the Night Club world by pretending that she's a man impersonating a woman. Robert Preston plays her flamboyantly Gay friend. And James Garner is all confused because he is falling in love with what everyone thinks is a man (Victoria aka Victor).
  This is probably Blake Edwards best movie.
