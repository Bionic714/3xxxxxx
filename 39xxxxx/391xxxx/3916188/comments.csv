,philos19,2009-05-26T18:24Z,"true we may argue that capitalism is an despicable system, which Ayn Rand exalt to the extremes trough ""objectivism"", but it's still a bad ass book, a definite read whatever your seat on the political spectrum"
,acfreema,2010-02-11T09:42Z,"a system that raises the idea of the individual to his rightful position as the purpose of his own life is worse than a system that raises AN individual or a select handful of people?  wow.
there's a reason you don't like rand: you're living in a fantasy world, not the real world."

You have a computer as the result of one mans effort, not to do good for you but to make a profit.  I agree with Rand when she says that nothing great has ever come about by committee. It takes a man willing to risk failure to create!  If you can't deal with that give back the shit you steal and live in a cave eaten nuts and berries!    
I am of the working class but I enjoy the things I get."
