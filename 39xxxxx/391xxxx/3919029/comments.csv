,Fortkis,2007-12-03T15:10Z,"Thanks Geezuz!

Does anyone know the code for Navigraph AIRAC in vRoute?"
,Geezuz,2007-12-03T15:35Z,"4X-AXG,

I must admit I haven't checked the list in a long time and it seemed to have all the common AIRACs. ""All"" indeed would been 20.

What's missing:
5 different AIRAC's for Project Magenta products
AirSimTech / AST
FS Instructor Panel 200X

I'm sorry for those who missed their AIRAC."
