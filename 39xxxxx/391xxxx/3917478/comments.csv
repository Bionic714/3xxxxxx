,booshmaster,2007-12-02T05:23Z,Metal (Lee Completion Mix) is fan made.
,godisvoid,2007-12-04T02:45Z,The quality on these is really terrible... There are mostly better quality versions on theheavensfall.net in the audio section anyway...

Yes several of these are from the remix album ""Fixed""; many of these are old fan remixes as well; ""We want it all"" is Trent Reznor on music; there are several demo tracks here which are widely available ; the please appendage should be just the end of the cassette version; Quick Fix?  I'm not sure what that is, my best guess would be the song by ""Foetus"" which was remixed be Charlie Clouser (former keyboardist of nin), and also Ice House was a band that Clouser briefly worked with before joining nin, I don't think that Option 30 did a track called ice house.  (I have all the option 30 albums and such, I'll upload em' if enough people care).
Anyway, sorry but this is a lame, messy, unorganized torrent, with horrible sound quality.  Why did you even bother uploading it?

Why am I commenting?"
,dartmouth,2007-12-11T21:04Z,"wow, did you actually listen to this or just look at the track list?  tell me exactly what's on fixed that's found here.  all of option 30's albums?  please let us know what they all are, because i'm pretty sure there was only one bootleg cd sold on the web a long time ago.  this WHOLE TORRENT is worth the download just for the upgraded butch vig mix, unless it's available by itself somewhere else.  'many of these are old fan remixes' ..i think it's all the real deal except the thrust mix, which is a good non-official mix, and metal, which the poster mentioned, and maybe quick fix because i've never heard of it.  the his mixes are from the his vip vinyl only, not available elsewhere (although they are available in much better quality.)  the gave up remix two is the short, quick coil mix from the movie 'young americans', if i recall correctly.  you ought to listen before you post comments.  i will, however, criticize the uploader for using wav on some tracks..a couple sound like they're mp3 sourced anyway, and flac compressed they take up about half the size."

,asamorris,2008-03-11T22:10Z,"thank you. when i update this, i will fix that. "
