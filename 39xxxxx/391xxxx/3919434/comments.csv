,moneydeep,2007-12-10T06:54Z,"NOT RIPPED
What does this mean?

IS it the GCF files inside? or extracted?

Please someone. This would really help me to know."
,vo0ta5tic,2007-12-10T17:32Z,"Nothing ripped means there is nothing removed so it's the full game.
But the game is a rip and the files aren't GCF files."
,Naheulbuck,2007-12-11T22:34Z,Thx for this great release. But do we must download and connect to steam to add servers in favorites or not ? Cause the three servers in the menu are full :(

,PALGOLAK,2008-01-01T04:15Z,"I can't seem to give my self an identity. Is this something to do with 'steam', or am I missing something obvious?"
,Barnacle Bill,2008-01-02T01:42Z,This is a Russian make and has been modified so that it links directly to Russian sites and if you put the file into a legit Steam Account folder it will display your Steam ID as your player name and THERE IS NO OPTION TO CHANGE IT so all that's needed is your password and your legit Steam ID is stolen!  I'd avoid this download and find another that hasn't been modified especially by a Russian!
,rev64,2008-01-03T12:38Z,"Guyz!
Im new at this torrent thing...
I just need to know if i can create a LAN game w/ this game?

,vo0ta5tic,2008-01-03T18:47Z,"they never steal your steam id!
And you don't need steam just do this:

,peopeo_,2008-01-05T03:53Z,"How do i play online ??
i have done everything that u all guys said, but i cant get it to work. 
I have the new patch and everything. 
And it takes about 5-10 minutes for a game to load, and then it is something about ""class board"" and you cant put servers in ur favorite either. 
Please can somebody, who is good at this, explain for me whats wrong! 
Sorry for my bad english!"

,Tachiarel,2008-02-06T18:28Z,"Hey, I've got a weird problem.

First, excuse me for my bad English.
But, once extracted, when I try to launch the game, the screens at the beginning (""Valve"" & ""Powered by Source"") show properly, but then I don't see anything.
I know I'm in the main screen (when I move the mouse, I hear clicks, as if I was pointing at options, and I can hear the main theme), but there's nothing to see.
The only thing (weird!) is a range of colors (dunno if i'm explaining well...).
I'm playing with WinXP.
Any help ?"
,Tachiarel,2008-02-06T18:29Z,"Furthermore, do I need to install Steam to play this game ?"

,Kombaynas,2008-02-10T02:48Z,"vo0ta5tic I have a question I hope you can answer? -  have a legit Steam account with Half Life 2 and CS:S. Is it safe if I run this TF2 Release + Steam, so I can view servers in server browser?

I run this TF2 Release and Steam on separate folders, no overwriting involved, but this TF2 release is getting the Browser info from Steam. Also the community overlay works in this TF2!

My legit SteamID didn't say I was playing TF2 or anything though. They were completely separate. 

No way to get banned right?"
