I have seen it several times!"
,Diceman_,2008-12-07T15:29Z,May I request an audio version of this?
,IGotDMCA,2010-02-01T11:20Z,I strongly recommend people not share this. I got a DMCA letter from them. They will enforce protection of their copyrights. Their stuff is high quality but I chose to delete it all after I got the letter.
,FuckDMCA,2010-05-24T18:29Z,"I didn't get any copyright letter after downloading all TTC courses. Knowledge should be free, who would be foolish enough to sue someone for gaining description that is true for all of us? I bet the ""IgotDMCA""-account is the owner or employee at TTC wanting to sell knowledge so he can buy a ferrarri. Download TTC-material, it's the best teachers teaching description that makes sense of where we are, why we are here and the situation we find ourselves in. Don't let the government remove knowledge, don't fear fools who want to make it available for only the wealthy in capitalism, those born rich for example. I strongly recommend everyone to share TTC-material. If something can be copied with no effort we should do it. It is a rare pleasure to be able to have infinite copies of something, an even greater pleasure when it's high quality courses like these. Also remember: you cannot observe the universe from the outside."
