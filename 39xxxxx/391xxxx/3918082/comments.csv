,sawilson005,2008-12-27T20:24Z,"Ok. I was wrong and I admit it. This will play but you have to burn onto a CD. It is playing but your DVD Player must be able to play CD's. Also, it didn't work when I tried to convert it to .iso and burn to DVD. It also has something about coming from India which is fine but I thought it was the actual DVD. This will do until I find just the movie or the actual copy of the DVD."
