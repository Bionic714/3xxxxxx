,stillbourne,2009-04-04T19:20Z,I'm a J.C purist and think it was a great tribute from a great hip hop artist to one of the men who influenced his own career. Props to Everlast for his cover of Folsom Prison Blues. Yes the song is a bit jagged in his presentation but that's all personal style. Anyways for what it's worth Everlast and Johnny are my peeps.

Also an amazing song. So im gonna download this torrent lol. About the Folsom Prison cover. I was not feelin it. But it wasnt horrible.
