2643 Ultrastar Songs

This is my collection of *.txt files for the Singstar-Clone Ultrastar. There are no mp3's included, simply because I don't have them and because that would blow the filesize to infinity and beyond. 

To play with these Songs you have to acquire the mp3's on a [...] way and you need Ultrastar or a compatible program. I recommend the new "Ultrastar Deluxe", you can find it on sourceforge.net .

I dont think that I can include the whole list of songs here, so in the torrent is beside the unprotected archive a simple textfile with a full list of all songs included in the archive.

I packed all the files because Windows has many troubles with >2600 files and I don't think that any BitTorrent-Client is able to handle so much damn small files. 

I am sorry that I can only seed with max. 40 KB/s, but I will try to spread it to a few friends so that it will be easily available And the archive is only 16 MB so it won't take long anyhow to spread it.

If you are looking for more songs visit these sites:

+ http://ssx.ss.funpic.de/index.php?file=All [one of the main sources of this release ~2300 songs]
+ http://www.ussongs.de.vu/ [a smaller site, but still good ~1700 songs]
+ http://pcsingstar.com/forum/ [a new, but very good size ~1200 songs]

If you wonder why the sum of the three sites are way over 2600 its because there are many doubles and I tried to filter them out as good as I can, still there are some left, excuse me for this. 

So, hope you like this and I will seed for as long as I can.
Spread it...
