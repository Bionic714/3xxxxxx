teesy: right-click the key folder & select copy. double-click 'my computer'. double-click 'c:'. right-click on a blank part of the window & select 'paste'. open your windows dos box like before and type cd c:\key then follow the rest of the instructions.

,pvti,2007-12-19T22:47Z,"i cant get this to work. ive followed the instructions word for word on my N95 8Gb but keep getting certificate error, even when i change the date back to 2006 and any month. 

Anyone know what could be going wrong? There are 2 folders that were already on my sd card 'private' and 'resourse' so i copied and pasted the files into their corresponding folders.

Help!!"
,ghanafirst,2007-12-26T15:58Z,can't you guys read he says this DOES not work with N95's. please read before you make comments
,mondosRS,2007-12-26T20:14Z,"ghanafirst -> it DOES work with N95 and Nokia 6110, but it doesn't work with its internal GPS module. One has to use external modul.

Now I have E65 and I get the same error as pvti. After choosing to install the tomtom it says certificate error - contact vendor or smth. Changing phone date is not doing it better (I have tried different dates).

I want to install this application on my Nokia N73 as soon as possible. But still the installation process is not very clear to me. I have been reading all the files but nothing seems to be very clear...

1. Can anyone please describe the (detailed) steps to follow during the installation.

2. How much memory available do I need on my Nokia N73?

Thanks in advance for your time and collaboration.

Looking forward to hearing from you..."

Starts to istall OK but after  about 20 seconds, I guess searching for a licence, says ""cerificate not valid or expired or date wrong"". Change date on phone to different months in 2006, same error. Used utility and changed time stamp on all (303) files to 2006, and the phone, plus reformatted & re-installed a few times. ""Certificate not valid, refer to supplier"". Any ideas? Your instructions and the file are good...much appreciated."
