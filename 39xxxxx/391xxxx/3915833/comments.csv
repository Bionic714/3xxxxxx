,stateofdreaming,2007-12-01T05:59Z,"why not label the movie is swedish, describe it in swedish, and even better yet have a filter here so i can strain out all the stuff I'll never be able to understand that's not in english. Why isn't there a search filter here at PB? "
,NofinnishsubsthankU,2007-12-02T00:15Z,"The swedish people have the right to speak whatever language they want, even though swedish is a world language. If swedes can learn english, the americans can learn swedish if they want to know what's going on in the world. Statofdreaming: Download the fucking movie, after you've learned to mastered swedish you have nothing to whine about. And you can turn off the swedish subs when you are at it, you will still catch enough words to know what you need to know. Violence is an universal language.  "
