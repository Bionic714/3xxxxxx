,pax681,2007-12-11T01:28Z,downloading now will seed for 8 days after i havwe completed download
,sloppydave,2007-12-23T02:35Z,sounds like it would be an awesome torrent but it is practically impossible to download because nobody wants to seed :(  If I can get it downloaded I will seed for sure.

,ezboard,2008-01-13T17:47Z,"What's wrong with you people?!?!
Why won't you seed?!?!
It's going to take me a whole fucking day just to download episodes 1 and 2 from this (using Utorrent, I can selectively upload whatever I want first, by telling the others dont download, then tell them to download when the one I want is done, though I STILL FUCKING SEED)"
,patrioticparadox,2008-01-15T11:37Z,ooooo arent you fancy ezboard. hate to bust up your ego but thats kinda common knowledge. thanks for the upload mortico

,BabelonKing,2008-03-25T18:59Z,"Thanks Mortico, I followed this Torrent from another one that you said had supposedly incomplete episodes. I hope your right about this one being the complete? I would also like to know if this is the uncensored versions and not the re-recoreded t.v. versions?"
,JackSchitt,2008-03-30T01:39Z,This torrent is censored for TV
