,pixelgazer,2008-05-03T20:03Z,"LOL! 'Breeding Ground - This Time Tomorrow' has a genre tag of CFNY. I knew that my farourite radio station was influential but I would never have imagined that someone would tag their music this way. The music that CFNY played in the 80's varied widely. You could hear a synth song followed by punk number. It was great! Come to think of it I should tag all my 80's music with a CFNY genre.

I haven't listened to this volume yet. Thanks in advance because I'm sure to like it.
