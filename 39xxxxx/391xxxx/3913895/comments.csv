To make a DVD9 into a DVD5 we have to do some shrinking but if it's done with finesse you should't see the differens. This is the fun part to be able to do. You can rip a movie into mpeg and put it on 700Mb, and you can upload an exact copy by 7G. I upload as good copy you can get on a ordinary 4,7G DVD-disc.

Thank's for the kiss, anyway! ;)"

thanks !
