Blaze Bayley gets no respect.  Really.  If people have heard of him at all, it's, at best "that guy that sang for Iron Maiden when Bruce was gone".  He is unfairly maligned for the quality of the songs on the two Iron Maiden albums he sang on (I actually really like The X-Factor album, but whatever) which is ridiculous, since he didn't write any of them.  So almost nobody seems to have even checked out any of his solo material.   Which is a mistake.  Because it really, really kicks ass.  

The style is very much what you'd expect: traditional heavy/power metal, with slight nods to both Priest and Maiden, though it doesn't really have much that sounds like either other than occasional twin guitar passages.  Blaze has a REALLY unusual voice and that gives the material a much more distinctive feel than it might otherwise have; if this were sung by any of the zillion Halford/Dickinson/Tate styled vocalists typical of traditional metal the songs wouldn't be nearly as ear-catching.  But they are, and they are.  Blaze Bayley is a lot more than a guy who filled in for Bruce Dickinson for a few years, just like Tim Owens is a lot more than a guy who filled in for Rob Halford for a few years (just listen to the last two Iced Earth albums, or Beyond Fear) and had a bad movie based on his story.  Blaze can't just sing, he can write great songs.  


If you still like that old skool metal sound, you gotta check out the Blaze solo work.  

Enjoy, and bang it 'til it bleeds!
