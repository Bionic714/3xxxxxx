Anyway it's true that it wasn't very advertasing for blaze to have problems with his voice and sing in front thousands of fundamentalistic south american maiden-fans...i really hope that people will find out what he can really do by listening wolfsbane and his solo career."

First Blaze solo song i heard was ""Born as a Stranger"", and i was instantly hooked!"
,drunkyarddude,2008-05-05T11:33Z,for me blaze bayley is better than bruce dickinson hell yeah. I dont care about iron maiden!
,drunkyarddude,2008-05-07T12:41Z,the brave song is better than any iron maiden song except futureal hehehe
,lopp-ster,2008-09-07T02:06Z,"I agree, in a way a find the x factor as one of the best maiden albums. However when maiden turned back to the ""old sound"" after ever diving 
ticket sales, they shat in the blue box!=virtual XI! ""old sound goes with old singer (not paul!), and new sound (x factor) goes with new singer=blaze bayley! -But iÂ´m sure the iron maiden banker doesÂ´nt agree! hugs and kisses to all maiden fans on the face of the earth!"
,lopp-ster,2008-09-07T02:19Z,"I also have to comment that Blaze indeed was a colaburator on ""the X Factor"",where he did a great contribusion on 5 of the songs."
