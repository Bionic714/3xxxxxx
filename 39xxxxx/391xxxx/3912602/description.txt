This is the FIRST CUT of the movie; over a million dollars were spent in
post-production after this cut.

This is also the SAME VERSION found in Rio de Janeiro streets prior
to the theater release. 



About the movie:
Tropa de Elite can be considered a sequence of what City of God left off.  
Due to the nature of crime in favelas, BOPE units have extensive experience in 
urban warfare as well as progression in confined and restricted environments. 
It also utilizes equipment deemed more powerful 
than traditional civilian law enforcement.


Plot summary:
The movie, set in 1997, depicts the story of Captain Nascimento, 
a BOPE captain, who with the imminent birth of his first child, 
is determined to leave the battalion and find a safer position 
for the sake of his family, but first he must find a suitable 
replacement for him. At the same time, the movie focuses on 
two childhood friends, Matias and Neto, who become cadets 
in the military police, but become dismayed at the 
corruption surrounding them. Eventually both 
Nascimento and the cadets' paths intersect, 
when the captain hopes that one of the 
two may become the substitute he is 
eager to find, as both decide to 
join the BOPE.
