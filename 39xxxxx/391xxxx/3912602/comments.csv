,felipon,2008-08-19T13:41Z,"Exellent movie!
There is one problem though; The subs are almost in the middle of the screen and i find that really anoying."
,kapten_skatt,2008-08-29T20:07Z,"Pretty bad translation, and subtitles are unfortunately placed in the middle of the screen."
,leoz_dnb,2008-09-12T21:41Z,"I don't like the subs embedded, and there's a lot of dialogue without subs and it's not synchronized"
,moagnor,2008-10-24T03:34Z,"Anyone know the exact title of the song played at the beginning of the movie? 

I know it is made by MC Leonard and MC Junior and the song is titled ""Rap Das Armas"". Have found two versions, one ""funk"" and one ""samba school"" but none of them sounds exactly like the one in the movie.

Need it for a DJ set. :)"
,Maoxx,2009-02-14T19:08Z,Good FUCK this movie is brilliant.
,BerserkTomte,2009-02-16T18:59Z,Awesome movie! I just wish the subs and translation were better. 
,diveb,2009-06-16T01:08Z,thank u man! 
,Jezpuh,2010-09-16T23:59Z,"Don't download. Horrible quality for such a big file. I've seen 700mb rips that look better. The movie is not even 2 hours long. Also, the translation is in the center of the screen, small and italic and often badly translated."
,azez911,2011-02-27T12:00Z,seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed pleeez!
,KarpoofdaJulii,2011-04-19T04:52Z,"@Jezpuh  I agree. The embedded subs are awful. Some appear on the screen for a thousandth of a second and are often poorly worded or misspelled. The video quality is very average as well, definitely doesn't warrant a 1.33GiB size."
