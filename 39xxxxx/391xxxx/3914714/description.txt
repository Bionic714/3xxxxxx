- Release Notes
* true 60i broadcast this season (last season was 25p to 60i)
unfortunately that didn\'t solve the the blended frames issue.
* S03E01 snuck up on me (such a random time and no adverts
announcing it) but scene rip at least spread around which
was not common last season so here is my rip...
* Enjoy the show.
