    It shows the file and says 100% finished ""AND SEEDING"" but there hasn't been anything uploaded????? THIS SUCKS, Its not like I gavnt ever done this, its easy. "
,"chad10,000",2007-12-01T08:32Z,"OK, THIS IS NOW MOORE LIKE IT... Please comment on how this has worked for, or even If you dont like it, just let us all know? 

     I personally think its the best Vista crack and I dont expect anything better to come out. "
,ivarssonivar,2007-12-03T16:48Z,it works for me now on vista 64 i sea if it continue to work thx for it 
,sweeznit,2007-12-03T18:11Z,I dont know if it worked or not. It says it was cracked successfully but it still says I need to activate windows. 
,"chad10,000",2007-12-05T15:12Z,"Sweeznit, WHAT? You had to have done something wrong because I have been using for about a month now............. I switched out from the ""Vista All x86 OneClick Activator-CLoNY"" Because the copy I was using ended up installing a Trojan Horse..... So If your using this scan after uncompressing with AVG Anti Virus.  I'm thinking not all copies of Vista All x86 OneClick Activator-CLoNY are actually infected, but some ass holes like to use this type of software to take advantage of unsuspecting people who don't know better, so be careful!!!  "
,CrouZ,2007-12-05T22:37Z,"I followed the instructions perfectly but it did not work. All windows popped up as the crack said they were supposed to, but the validation status is still Activation required. I run Vista Ultimate x64 btw."
,"chad10,000",2007-12-07T09:42Z,"Crouz, If you read above at the description  you will also see it says ""Windows Vista 32"". 
  In other words as in ""x32"" , ok  man? I know some people have said they got it to work on 64. "
,kimoemo,2007-12-15T07:12Z,"I get an error ... =( it says... Windows Script Host
Run 'slui.exe 0x2a 0xC004F015' to display the errow text. Error 0xC004F015

I use ""Vista All x86 OneClick Activator-CLoNY"" then remove the ""trojan horse generic8.rkv"" using AVG... 

on the System window it says Windows is Activated... but I just wanted to make your using this ""vista cack"" 

do you think think I'm getting this error cause I use ""Vista All x86 OneClick Activator-CLoNY"" 1st then ""vista cack""?!?!?!?"
,"chad10,000",2007-12-18T15:37Z,"Kimoemo, Yes I think this error is because you have the Vista All x86 OneClick Activator-CLoNY installed first. I had this problem using that myself, one I had to reinstall the Vista All x86 OneClick Activator-CLoNY and It wouldnt crack windows again, and I think this is from one of the many windows updates that windows have come out with"
,ApeKiller,2008-03-06T18:51Z,"chad10,000 YOU ARE A PIECE OF SHIT!!"
,"chad10,000",2008-03-09T05:46Z,"Well, I will upload another crack especially for ""SERVICE PACK 1"" Or ""SP 1"" But again this crack is now obsolete  because of the new Windows Vista  update which installs ""SP 1""  Microsoft is trying to fight back, but thats o.k. because no matter what that dick head Bill Gates always wins because he's got BILLIONS, & BILLIONS, & BILLIONS, & YES EVEN MORE BILLIONS, So he doesn't need my money or even yours because he wins regardless If he ever gets a $1 from one of us. So share and continue borrowing until the end of time, and tell corporations that think there larger then God Or life itself to ""FUCK OFF!!!!"" FOREVER!!!! Amen!!!"
,"chad10,000",2008-03-09T05:56Z,"And yes, exactly........ these larger then life software corporations, Microsoft being the most profitable in the entire world, all want everyone to believe that Torrent Sites are just full of Viruses and Trojans. But this is not true, most of the Viruses and trojans that are developed are for software companies to profit even farther by selling Virus, Spyware and Malware software. The more these Viruses are a threat, the more money they make!!!! Think About it"
,"chad10,000",2008-03-17T08:58Z,"Hey Ape shitter, what exactly is your problem anyways? ""DO YOU HAVE A FUCKING PROBLEM ME ASS WIPE!!! The only reason you talk shit here is because you think you can get away with it by hiding behind you PC. YOU ARE JUST A NO GOOD HERMIT"
,Enta_3umry,2008-04-10T11:39Z,"I'm running Vista Business 32 bit and I had the same error:
Run 'slui.exe 0x2a 0xC004F015' to display the error txt.
And still showing remaining days to activate.

Any clue? Anybody's help is appreciated."
