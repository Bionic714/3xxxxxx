ItÆs finally with a great pleasure that Metapsychic Records present its 5th and final release, ôInner Cycloneö, the first album of Ali Akg³n, alias ôMindsphereö.
This exclusive promotion reunites AliÆs best tracks which were played in his numerous live performances across Turkey, 
during the period 2003-2006, and contains also a chill-out piece of his new ambient project called ôMindphoriaö.       
The main concept of ôInner Cycloneö is to propel the listeners/dancers in the middle of a tornado of high sensitive 
feelings and authentic emotions, directly inspired by AliÆs various experiences of life. The goa fans will be certainly
touched and bewitched by the diversified oriental tonalities of this dynamic & melodic eastern-influenced album, 
which will recreate in your mind a subliminal panoramic vision of the mythic Anatolia. 
Prepare your spirit and mind out your sphere!  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We would like to notice you that this album is also Metapsychic Rec. last release. Our net-label will no longer exist (see the official announcement of our closure
at our websites), but we are glad and proud to quit this adventure as we started it, with a free goa release that
you can consider as a final gift from our part.

Metapsychic records would like to thank the following people for their help and support:

We would like also to express, from the depth of our heart, all our gratitude to our beloved and talented artist, Ali ôMindsphereö, 
for his amazing album, his trusting and his faithful friendship. It was an honour for us to work with him and release such great music,
and even if itÆs for free. We have no doubt that youÆll hear even more beautiful music from his part in a near future, - even if it will
not be under our label anymore -, because his new productions already totally blow us away. We wish him a brilliant success and the very best luck 
for his music career.
