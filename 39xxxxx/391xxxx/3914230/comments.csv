,djmattie,2008-10-15T20:45Z,"The executable file ""setup.exe"" seems to contain a trojan, specifically Win32:VB-JWV

I'm not disputing that that software works, but you will get a little surprise along with it."
,cimmer99,2008-12-28T03:30Z,"Virus ID is most likely a false positive.  Only AV scanner (out of 38 @ virustotal.com) that called it a trojan was Ikarus.  Virus signatures are prone to false positives at best, downright suspect at worst."
,cimmer99,2008-12-28T03:31Z,"Btw, software works perfectly."
