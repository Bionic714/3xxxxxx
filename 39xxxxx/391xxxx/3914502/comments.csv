This by far is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever seen. It really should be ""Ten Ways The World Will End According to Shitty Fiction With No Basis in Reality or Common Sense."" It's just a rundown of all the ways bad writers have generated fiction dealing with the world ending (alien invasion, the sun exploding on us, etc.) and there's ZERO science or useful (or even useless) information in here, just crappy science fiction and an annoying host trying to sound macabre and spooky and failing miserably at it. Skip this one unless the only other thing you have to watch besides this is shemale horse bukakke porn. Which would still be moderately more informative / entertaining than this."
,m172226,2008-10-31T14:47Z,"Video quality and everything's okay... but in case you're wondering, this is pretty much zero science. It's more like a documentary talking about the various different (highly implausible) ways the world has been imagined to end in fiction (bad fiction, too). I personally thought it was a huge waste of time because I was expecting a documentary talking about the most serious risks we face in the short and long term future from what scientists can tel us, but to each his own."
