How can i play RAR-fil??"
,Dankouver,2007-11-30T07:24Z,"a .rar file is like a .zip file but you need a program to open it.

get winrar http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3746465/Winrar_3.70_and_Key.exe_CleaN_

Double the first .rar file (it will open) drag the .avi file to your desktop and then you are good to go.

The picture is absolutely perfect, but the audio is AWFUL. Still very watchable, though.

Great film, BTW."

If you want better quality, then fork over the $20 bucks and wait for DVD release."

,rockstar11998,2008-03-13T04:31Z,"why do people still burn to dvd.  There are great Divx players/dvd recorders available at low cost.  Why not fit 6 movies on a disc rather than 1.  Save yourself some time too.

This movie rox.  Down with Islam."
,we_are_borg,2008-03-18T12:40Z,islam is irrelevant and will not be assimilated to the collective...we are borg.
