Just flight is a great company I wish someone would put up a FSX version of their a340. It has a very acurate MCDU."

,FlightSimerr,2007-12-03T16:07Z,I didn't realize that CLS a340 is the same as the Just Flight a340. Thanks Riko
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-04T20:46Z,"well i downloaded the CLS A340 for fsx with all the updates from tpb and the MCDU's numbers don't input. Only the Letters Do. 

Ah well just have to wait till the justflight one comes out. unless anyone knows a fix.

Thanks! "
