Description:

In many fairy tales, there lives a terrible beast of stupendous power, a dragon or a basilisk, which tyrannizes the surrounding lands. The local villagers tremble before this monster; they sacrifice their animals, pay money and blood in the hopes of appeasing its murderous impulses. Year after year, decade after decade, wave after wave of hopeful champions try to match their strength, virtue and cunning against this terrible tyrant. Try â?? and fail. Inevitably, a man steps forward who strikes everyone as utterly incongruous. He is a stable boy, a shoemakerâ??s son, a bakerâ??s apprentice â?? or sometimes, just a vagabond. This book is the story of my personal assault on just such a beast. This â??beastâ?? is the belief that it is impossible to define an objective, rational, secular and scientific ethical system. This â??beastâ?? is the illusion that morality must forever be lost in the irrational swamps of gods and governments, forever lacking logical justification and clear definition...
