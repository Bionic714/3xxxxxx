Schickele Mix was Peter (P.D.Q. Bach) Schickele's award-winning themed classical 
music education and humor program, produced from 1992 to the late 1990s and 
distributed in repeats until 2007.  This file contains in AAC format (playable in 
iTunes and other players) 25 Schickele Mix programs.  Programs run approximately 
58 minutes each and are cut into around 12 tracks each for convenience (not cut 
by individual piece of music).  Note that programs 135 and 136 are incomplete; 
they were, unfortunately (or perhaps not), edited down by the source of these 
airchecks to remove an excessive number of annoying novelty numbers.  Programs 
are:
120: The Ties that Bind
121: That Weird & Intoxicating Effect
122: The Count Is 3 & 2
123: Keeping Christmas
124: Quintessential Music
