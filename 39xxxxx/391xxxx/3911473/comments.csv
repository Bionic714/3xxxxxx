,HundenSkalman,2007-11-30T21:20Z,a little more speed on the seed would be nice...
,[NoFear],2008-01-03T11:27Z,"Seed
I've been on 47.2% for 2 days"
,TotallyWicked,2008-01-31T01:10Z,"I love the comments. Kind of understand the motivation of the original ripper saying don't share this shit. Anyway, enjoy. I have seeded this once and so thanks to all the crew for keeping it alive AND thanks to you for downloading it ."
[T],komie,2008-04-06T18:31Z,I thought the whole point of torrents was to share and the more that share the longer the file(s) survive... whether people want it or not... its a shame people have to feel so exculsive. i say SHARE!
,TotallyWicked,2008-05-05T12:38Z,"couldn't agree more. Once Oink was killed I threw the file up here for the people. I hate elitist crap as much as the next man.. I appreciate the original ripper for ripping but for me I want the music spread not kept to impress!!
  Big shout to the Kool crew . 16 years and counting ."
,stevieb,2008-07-17T13:22Z,"Thanx 4 uploadin n seedin :D

Keep Lucky all !!"
[T],komie,2008-08-23T20:00Z,"i agree with the comments about the crap compilations that come out by fags like ministry of (ÂŁ)ound but the whole point of getting these files together then not sharing to everyone is pretty pointless. the more seeders leechers the better. faster for everyone. only people that want old skool will appreciate the time and energy put in to making large torrents, and thats what its all about, appreciation.
