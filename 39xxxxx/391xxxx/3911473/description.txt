The Ultimate Old Skool Drum n Bass Collection
---------------------------------------------




This collection of old skool Drum n Bass is unique to Oink

------------ LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY ----------------------




This collection took me many hundreds of hours to collate
from all sorts of various sources:

My own CD's
Point 2 Point
Direct Connect
Swapping with Friends
Even bits from the odd album from a torrent
as well as Good ol' Scene releases


I did not do this for any kind of desperate need for respect

I did this purely for the love of this criminally forgotten
and ignored era of British Youth and Music culture

The shitty "so called" Old Skool Albums that get released
commercially are a fucking insult, and at their best, pretty
flakey to say the least - containing nothing but a bunch of
chart/club tunes, that were listened to by nobody other than
shirt-wearing townies getting drunk on alcho-pop's in piss
poor disco's


This collection is the real deal - the real rave tunes of
early 90's Britain

Remember & Enjoy a time of full strenght pill's, and
music with NO boundries....


---------------------------------------------------------
---------- NOW THE IMPORTANT BIT ------------------------


DO NOT under any circumstances seed this torrent on other
trackers

WHY - because ultimately it degrades not only the value of
the music, but of your own music collection....

THINK about it.. Why would you want to give something likethis to a bunch of ignorant and ungrateful leech monkeys
who just grab stuff for the sake of it, and not because they
appreciate or have any love for the music that means so much
you????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

How proud would you feel if you wanted to show off your
fantastic collection of uber rare UK Old Skool to someone,
only for them to turn around and say.. That shit's two a
penny all over the net

So....

Hold it Down People - Keep it tight!!!!



----------------------------------------------------------

I've no problem with people, reseeding this torrent back
to Oink (check that it's no longer on the tracker first)

BUT - please have the common courtesy to just send me a
quick PM first, and let me know (it's for the best, coz
i may be in the process of sticking up an updated version
myself - innit)

Many thanx for your co-operation - [Def-Ade]
