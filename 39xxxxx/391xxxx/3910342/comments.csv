I cannot tell you how much I have appreciated all of this. As a broadcaster online, you have made my whole year. This is a great collection. And now, as you take your bow, as the curtain draws, I have to tell you how much I have appreciated you. Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to this project. You are one hell of a seeder. One hell of a person for this. \m/ YOU ROCK \m/"

Have low upload rates but will keep seeding for as long as practicle to the 45 folk who are still ploughing through this epic collection. Would buy you a beer towerelect if you were back in your home area!! Cheers"

,kenwal100,2009-07-17T16:30Z,"Many thanks for these, if anybody is interested I've written a windows application that takes the unzipped files and then creates subdirectories of Artist's just to make finding them easier  handy if you have a media center on your PC. If anybody wants it let me know and I'll upload it.

Cheers Ken
