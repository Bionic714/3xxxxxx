,gigerm,2007-12-07T00:54Z,you need a cfw to play this
,Irashtar,2007-12-07T18:13Z,"I have 3.71 M33-3, it still won't run, what else do I need?"
,yogibears,2007-12-12T23:32Z,"I got 3.71M33-4 from PSPScene.net today in hopes of getting this to work, but haven't had time to test it out.. someone check it out it might work!! :D"
,lbartley,2007-12-13T11:09Z,"Playing ISOs natively is a matter of convenience. It's easier to load all your games up on a Memory Stick than it is to haul around 10 UMDs. 

Hacking the PSN DRM though, is entirely another matter."
,unusingur,2008-01-13T03:33Z,"and i say, dcjoedog, that is hypocracy to play lots of pirated game that costs 25$ or so each and complaining about not being able to play a single 5$ one.
someone said on a forum : ""i preffer to buy ps3 games and play pirated psp games"". wise choise, wise quote, wise kid, really. both sides have to survive: the producer and the player. WICH MEANS, IDIOT, THAT YOU ARE FREE TO PLAY PIRATED GAMES NO MATTER HOW MUCH, BUT AT LEAST PAY FOR A GAME FROM TIME TO TIME, IF YOU WANT DEVELOPMENT!
and i dont think you woud've been able to play those isos without those ""hypocrits"" coding those cfw, right, cunt?!!"
