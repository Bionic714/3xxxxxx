Please note this film is in English.  I've no idea why it says Swedish in the ""Spoken language"" section?!   must have messed up when I uploaded it.
Enjoy!"

thanks for the tip. i saw this link --->The Perfect Weapon (1991) DVDRip. MovieExtreme.avi at another site but no comments and a few seeder/leeches. figured i'd check here before trying it. after seeing your comment and the 'trusted' pink skull i think i'll try it out. my buddy at work is going to be happy i found his movie.

thanks and cool running ;)"
