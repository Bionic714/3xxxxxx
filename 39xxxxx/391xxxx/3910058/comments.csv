,ishmael81,2007-12-17T13:47Z,"U download ImgBurn, and install it. Its free. Then You extract the file, so the outcome will be 2 files. One big image file and one small file. You open the small file, and it will automaticly burn the .img file. The small file say where the layer break should be. Oh and dont forget to burn this game on a DL 8Double Layer) disc. "

,flank2,2009-06-02T20:39Z,"works perfect on my ixtreme 1.51 NTSC xbox with no problems, played through the entire single player with no crashes/audio issues

burn your games at 2.4x write speed! & use verbatim +R dual layer dvd's, and i'd also verify the disc after burning has completed, and yes be prepared it is going to take roughly 1 hour to finish burning with these settings

thanks uploader :)"
