,paulbarden2000,2007-11-30T22:56Z,she has a big future in music i think 
,shreksdonkeyy2,2007-11-30T22:58Z,"i  compare her now to a young MJ, thats will be the type of future she will have, just without the bad media, Brilliant.."
,mjj1,2007-12-01T09:00Z,i'll have to agree about being like a little MJ but the media don't care who they hurt as long as they get a story. They nearly wrecked MJ career but he's back soon.
