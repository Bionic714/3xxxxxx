[T],rage!,2008-08-24T04:14Z,"Shouldnt be. They came right off the CD.

I just checked and yes they are. Track 22 is titled ""untitled"" and it should be ""Raleigh Soliloquy Pt. 3/Don't Push""	"
,ubrmnsch,2009-06-10T00:10Z,"I only downloaded track 1, 7, 12, and 18. Track 1 and 7 were correct, but track 12 (Pool Shark) is actually track 11 (Lincoln Highway Dub) and track 18 (Falling Idols) is actually track 17 (I Don't Care For Reggae Dub)."
[T],rage!,2009-06-26T02:51Z,"Yeah I think this has already been covered. I messed up the track names. To double check goto amazon and search for this album.

Thanx for the comments"

,alienjesus,2010-11-21T02:09Z,"For some reason it put the titles for free loop and q-ball together, so everything after that is one title off, all the way down to untitled which is Raleigh Soliloquy Pt. 3"
,candycanegl,2011-06-26T19:22Z,"I used to own the CD and the track titles were fucked up too on my comp .. so it's not the uploader, it's the album. 

Thanks for the up - lost this album long time ago, one of my all time favs!!!!"
