,merlinregis,2008-09-05T20:25Z,"Hey!!! Let's take a deep breath here and calm down a bit people. 

First of all, take in consideration that the people who have the friendlyness of offering us the torrents are NOT necessarily online 24/7.

ok, so the common problem here is to stop seeding... when you do so... PLEASE have the decency of ERASING the torrent.

Suggestion : seed one week, post a comment that whoever wants to continue seeding to mention it in the comments and for how long, and so on... 

That way we won't be bitching at each other as I've read here from certain very impatient people.

I'm also stuck at 97% and will be seeding for as long as I'm stuck at 97% or until my patience kills the download. And... YES... I will post a comment when my patience kills the download."
,Philster07,2008-09-07T15:11Z,"Brilliant torrent, but (like every1 else) I'm stuck at 97%. Do something about it!

Just to help ur missing the best song (immigrant song), hats of to roy harper & celebration day"
,merlinregis,2008-09-09T12:38Z,"ok, so my patience killed the download... 

I did a little search and managed to make an ""almost complete"" kit... just missing 2 songs. Also added the ""hairway to steven"" which can be found here : 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3271849/Led_Zeppelin_-_Hairway_to_Steven_(bootleg)

Which is good little piece to have in your collection if you're a led zep fan.

Gonna put it up in the next few days for those who want to cancel this one and take mine. 

Hopefully, I'll have found the 2 missing songs between now and then.

Come back here for more details. should be up by the week-end.

:)"
