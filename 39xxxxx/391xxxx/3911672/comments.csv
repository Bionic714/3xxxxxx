,Alex030594,2008-04-03T04:25Z,"Hello
I haven't downloaded this yet:\
Could you please tell me is you could change the 737-400 missions to use the aircraft 737-800?
Please help

Thanks"
,Alex030594,2008-04-03T04:35Z,"Hi
Just reading the description i think that you may have just made a mistake because you say that it is the 3 set default aircraft on F.S.X and before you typed 747-400 so you may have made the 400 mistake from that. 
So i will download:D
Does it work anyone?

Thanks"
