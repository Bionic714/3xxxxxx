It's spelled incorrectly. Messed it up when I ripped it. Just now caught it though. SHOULD be ""When the Light Turns Yellow Don't Push the BREAKDOWN"" (yes, 'BREAKDOWN' is listed in all caps on the CD jewel case).

Edit your ID3 tags though. No big deal. But I made this comment 'cause if any of you are like me you get pretty annoyed when your ID3 tags aren't right."
