,SHaDOW_PHaNTOM,2007-11-30T10:36Z,"Ok, is it just me or is the audio screwed up from about 30:01 to the end of the show?  Seems like it's either going fast or slow, and not sure what, but it's really screwed up.  Can't really understand what they are saying either...Think anyone will do a PROPER of this?"
,SHaDOW_PHaNTOM,2007-11-30T10:56Z,"The problem is that after 30:01 the audio doubles in speed, and just screws it up completely.  Believe this can be fixed though.  I'm going to rip the audio off the file, then slow down the speed, and see if it's better.  If it works, I'll re-add, and sync it, and try and re-up it as a proper."
,griseknoen,2007-11-30T15:24Z,"It also brakes before its finished,so you cannot see whos woted out."
,daklaw,2007-11-30T18:51Z,"some major problems towards the end of the file. after the immunity challenge, the audio is screwed."
