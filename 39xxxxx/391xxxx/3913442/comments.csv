,azazriel,2008-05-09T02:51Z,"This came down SUPER fast, great torrent, but I'm getting an error with the crack on 32bit windows vista...

When I try and run the crack, I get a 'access denied' error, but no further explanation.

Any ideas?"
,azazriel,2008-05-09T03:03Z,"Nevermind... I solved it. :)

Right-click the crack and choose ""run as administrator"""
,victorfog,2008-09-11T22:12Z,ty Genesis2k6 you rock!
,lk182,2008-09-13T10:18Z,"Anybody else having a problem with the crack?

It said the crack worked successfully.. but then Newsbin keeps telling me to register, and I get the god forsaken nag window.  Anyone know what the deal is?"
,IndyDoug,2008-09-27T22:29Z,You saved me $35 however I may have to pay for a faster Usenet server. My current default Usenet server only has a 2 Mbs download rate.
,fickit,2008-10-18T06:31Z,"does the crack still work with this version?
Thx for the upload."

[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2012-08-16T22:07Z,Hooh every keygen & crack will spook those free  virus things & norton & some others & will call it a trojan when its not even in a trojan format! They arent all trojans. Buy the 20 quid for life pack if in doubt its a steal ...
