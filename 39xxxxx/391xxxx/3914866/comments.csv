I've been seeding the originals since you posted them (and still getting a few leechers floating in and out to complete their downloads). Because you're reusing the same torrents, when I hit 'download' here, uTorrent just says something like ""this torrent already loaded, would you like to add new trackers"" and I'm instantly seeding."

Never encountered this before...I have played Mpeg 4 files before"
