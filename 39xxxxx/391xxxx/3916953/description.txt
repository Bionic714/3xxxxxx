Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell
2006 Hallowe'en Show, 31 Oct 06.
Running time: 163 minutes, 28 seconds
Format: mp3, exported from Audacity 
Recorded in glorious MONO from a crappy AM radio.

Notes:
This show is called "Ghost to Ghost AM" on Hallowe'en night because the host turns it over to callers with ghost stories.

Art Bell was broadcasting from Manila,
Philippines, and so there are occasional dropouts and delays.

There is also a strange problem between 16:15 and 16:45 where Art may have inadvertently played a tape in the middle of his Ouija board story.

Commercials, station IDs cut.  Everything else is exactly as it was broadcast.

Share and enjoy.
