Currently enabled only for users whose Windows Live ID country is US or Canada.) 
* Signature sounds â?? Pick your own personal sound that your contacts will hear when you sign into Messenger (only works if you and your contacts have Messenger 9.0 Beta). 
* Per contact sounds - Pick unique sounds for each of your contacts. You will be able to tell from across the room who is sending you a message.
