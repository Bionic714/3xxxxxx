,LebaneseLarry,2007-12-07T23:59Z,"There's definitely something fishy about this torrent. Been trying to download it for 24hours now and I'm only halfway through with over 980MB of failed data and a current speed of 0.8KB/s. Either it's a bogus torrent or somebody (anti-piracy zealot) is successfully ""screwing it up""."
,aubster,2007-12-12T03:11Z,Does anybody else have no sound or could you help??
,kraut58,2007-12-19T14:23Z,Thanks Diamond for an excellent conversion. It is greatly appreciated.
