,Derenoc,2008-01-16T15:16Z,"I can't actually get this game to work. It runs OK, but all it displays is a screen where you see the hud and something that looks lika a simple arena level, but there's no character on it and i cannot do anything, no keyboard inputs do anything. What's wrong?"
,jankkinen,2008-06-27T16:21Z,I can get it work :(. It says i have wrong disc.
,jankkinen,2008-06-27T16:22Z,i mean i can't.
,codename24,2008-06-29T07:04Z,"The crack is in a folder called ""Cura"". Anyway i can't get it work i have the same problem as Derenoc. DAMN IT !"

,bullthorn,2009-02-07T22:11Z,"Appreciate the effort, but this is not a quality release; surprising that it comes from a trusted user.  The contents of the multi-volume RAR archive are clearly a copy of the installed game folder.  I deleted these and found an actual CD image of the game, which is what this should have been."
,qqqin,2009-02-20T16:25Z,get the game here http://www.old-games.ru/game/download/1208.html
,pilves-orav,2009-06-09T15:21Z,Seed plz
,Alan00000,2009-10-10T03:52Z,"Just installed it , over writed the crack selected my options and started to play . works fine on vista. I've been playing Risen so i dont have time to play this graphics arent that good, but gameplay is good. I'd rather play Risen cause of the graphics."
,Jay_Riot,2009-11-16T07:13Z,"Ok...and how the f*** do I play this? I mean I know how to mount images and whatnot, but this is a mess of a dl. A quick, simple, and easy to follow tutorial would be amazing."
,Jay_Riot,2009-11-16T23:34Z,Anybody? D:
,AlucFahhT,2009-12-17T16:28Z,"this is shitty >_> i open the game, once it loads, im at the start screen, but all options r black, no mouse pointer and i cant click nothing."
,KEDRAEL,2010-01-02T06:53Z,"for those who cant see any menu options - you need to run it in opengl.  Install this: http://www.thecrawdaddypage.com/reviewsA/shots/bod/raster.zip

for those of us who cant play it because it just crashes - as far as I know we're screwed.  The patch may fix it, but no one ever released a crack for the patched version."
,PohiTheFawx,2010-08-06T23:22Z,ISO?
,Kounelokinigos,2010-11-24T13:23Z,where the fuck is the folder cura?
,mythmore,2011-05-27T22:16Z,"Everyone open your eyes and read carefully,I had this game and im fan of BOD,Now for years i didnt played it was yesterday I saw a video of BOD on youtube and decide to play again,I installed my original version,after installing in the setup i chose D3D at 1024x768 32bit,I launch the game normally intro was blank,its fine because I use xp sp2,Menu options opened well,I installed a mod called bod loader iirc after that installed Gladiator mod,after that patched the game to the latest one official*. when i was playing after something like 3 min the game crashed i get very fucking angry because I couldnt play it,Now I remember I've played this game 3 years ago on XP-SP3 without problem,anyway,I decide to give a try to this one in here,I downloaded fine installed and opened the game on the same settings but without patching the game,It runs well now im playing it and seeding. Here Im trying to explain is for this game is very awesome but its very old, This game does not support newer GPU's machines and system,its very old but you have to give it a try,Damn this game is awesome.
Thanks for sharing it works on my XP SP3 32bit. "
