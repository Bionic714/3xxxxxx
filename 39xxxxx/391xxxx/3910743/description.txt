Sweatshop Union is a Canadian hip hop collective.

The group came together in Vancouver, British Columbia in 2000, when four politically-minded rap acts (Kyprios, Dirty Circus, Creative Minds and Innocent Bystanders) came together as a collective. Like rap groups such as Wu-Tang Clan, each of the constituent acts continues to record and perform independently as well as with Sweatshop Union.

They released their self-titled debut album independently in 2001; the following year, it was released on Battleaxe Records, Swollen Members' label, as Local 604.

Members of the group include Kyprios, Metty the DertMerchant, Mos Eisley, DJ Itchy Ron, Mr. Marmalade, Conscience and Dusty Melodica.
