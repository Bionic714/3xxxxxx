,neocorpse,2008-02-28T16:07Z,"For Vista users:
The only real way to use AlienGUIse on vista is a pain in the ass but if you're dedicated you can still pull it off.
The way I've done it you will need the following apps made by Stardock.
Windowblinds 5.5 or 6.0
Icon Packager 3.10
Object Dock (free or Pro will work)
You have to install AlienwareGUIse first. Once installed you can go into the main directory which is usually C:\Program Files\AlienGUIse
Ther you will se a folder called Themes. Open the folder and there will be several folders named for each theme. Inside each folder you will see more folders, but the all important file is a .suite.
Copy the .suite file to another location on your rig and rename the file extension to .zip. Then create a new folder with the same name for extraction purposes. Extract the contents of the newly renamed zip to the new folder, open and you will see folders for both the Windowblinds and Icon Packager skins. In each corresponding folder there will be a .iptheme for use with Icon Packager. Don't bother with the blinds unless you intend on building a new one from scratch, as it does not contain an actual .wba file in any of the folders. Aside from that, the skins are XP based and will look funky in Vista. the IP files are all fine and can be installed to Packager's library by either clicking on it or installing it from Packager's install feature. This is not a fool-proof method, but unfortunately it's the best way to use at least parts of the themes for Vista. "
