Madvillainy is the debut album by American hip hop duo Madvillain, a group consisting of MF DOOM (MC) and Madlib (producer). It was released on March 24, 2004 on Stones Throw Records to overwhelmingly positive reviews.[1] It was praised for its unique and innovative approach to hip hop: short songs, recondite lyrics, few choruses and a sound which was generally unfriendly to commercial radio. The album nevertheless achieved moderate commercial success, peaking at #179 on the Billboard 200 and attracted much attention from media outlets not usually covering hip hop music, including The New Yorker. It is widely considered to be the best independent hip hop record of the 2000s.
