,jonyd1,2007-12-20T05:42Z,"Yea...looks like all of the guitar rig torrents here run for a while, but eventually close down after 15 minutes or so...if anyone know a way around this, that would be very helpful."
,mikeyf,2007-12-21T21:47Z,"turn your clock back a year, it worked for me, and i tried uninstalling, clearing reg entries etc works with flstudio 7.0.2 aswell, which is fine if its your seperate audio pc, but is impractical if you are using programs like msn messenger and some other applications as they show errors. it would be nice if there was some kind of software or patch that tricked tricked some apps into thinking it was 2006 as this works with quite a lot of software ive tried."
,owl,2008-01-05T00:55Z,After five minutes I hade a message on the screen that this version om Guitar Rig illigaly installed.

,GeneralSch,2008-02-07T23:48Z,"Do I need this foot pedal to use the program?
And does it run on vista?"

,deep_reaper,2008-07-24T20:18Z,Hey people please for seed.I try to download this program from long time ItÂ˛s the best ever.Thanks 
,Dudeitskevin22,2008-09-21T22:53Z,"if someone uploads the damn Rig Kontrol 3 iso we dont need the pedal. You can just plug a 1/4th -> 1/8th jack into your microphone slot on your computer so you can plug your guitar directly into your computer. I use to have this about a year ago and its what I did, you just dont get Pedal and get to use Wah n shit."
,josebcn,2009-06-16T22:06Z,Thanks 4 sharing mate.
,ampbc,2009-08-30T18:50Z,"This works great! I first installed the guitar rig 3.0.1, but I couldn't get the audio set up correctly, even with asio4all. I then tried guitar rig 3.0, SWEET SUCCESS!!! it's an awesome program!!!!
The only problem is when I try to record using the tapedeck, and I go to save it as ""whatever.wav"", I get an error saying that it can't open the file, or it's corrupt or something like that. Anyone know what's going on?

Thanks a million Danell!"
,spiderrichard,2009-11-12T18:56Z,"i still dont understand where the .dll is ment to go. can anyone please explain in more detail than Place DLL in the VSTPlugins subdirectory.
