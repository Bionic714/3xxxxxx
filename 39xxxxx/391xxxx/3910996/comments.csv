,laodeng,2008-04-16T12:25Z,Has anyone perhaps scanned the COURSE GUIDE for this most interesting torrent? It would be a welcome addition. Thanx.
[T],doktor_zook,2008-10-01T09:51Z,"The course guide comes along with the audio course with the same name. This is a really good one (surprisingly, considering he's black), except for his talk on the history of germanic languages, which is so way of the mark I suspect the usual anti-white motivations rather than incompetence. Can't remember the name of a book my the same one (John McWorther), but I remember it sounded interesting on Amazon."

But I'm guessing its the racist."
