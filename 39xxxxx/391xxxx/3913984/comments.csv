,BananazCortez,2009-11-14T18:53Z,Why in Rar files? wot is the point? why not AVI?
,[SeriousDesert],2009-11-15T14:55Z,it's in .rar to compress it you fool. else the file size would be much bigger and it'd take longer to download.
,KaneMarster,2009-11-22T22:15Z,can some one upload the Avi File as this one whont play in on my pc it seams to play but has not sound 
,Si-man,2010-06-17T22:15Z,Unpacking them asks for Extras Part 4 - But this doesn't exist. Only got 700MB of this to work.
,7b,2011-03-03T22:48Z,".rar does VERY little to compress .avi video - less than 10% - so there is no point AT ALL to using it. But it does mean that I won't seed, because I'll unpack it and then delete the .rar files. The uploader is to blame, though, really."
