,TorrentLover1983,2007-12-03T00:35Z,will this work for tiger or only on leopard?
,Macxml,2007-12-03T01:30Z,This is the last beta version that left for Tiger.
,jellings,2007-12-03T12:09Z,the beta versions have expired and will no longer create new partitions. the only way to create new bootcamp partitions is to install leopard i think
,plinxie,2007-12-03T13:56Z,"It actually works if you set the time back, do what you need (e.g. burn driver disk) then set the time back to normal.

For boot matters i still prefer Refit"
,Freedom_142,2008-05-02T01:08Z,"So Does this work for tiger? - IS THERE any way to get bootcamp for tiger? cuz i dont want to download leapord as it takes forever, or spend 130."
,jdiver,2009-02-07T12:45Z,"To get the beta to work you have to set your date back to 2005 for the installation, after that you can set it back. Then it should work fine."
,Undicesimo,2010-12-29T23:38Z,"Just set your date prior to 2007. I think it was prior to 12/31/2007, but just to be safe, set it to late 2006 or early 2007. I believe it should work that way."
