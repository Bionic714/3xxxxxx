,Humours,2007-11-28T10:07Z,"Hello Miss J.!

Good to see you here! I will check it out But reseeding is up to you folks... It took so long to upload all episodes :)"
,missjenniferd,2007-11-28T10:57Z,"are you still seeding the first half of season 10, or
have you deleted that one already? if you still have
the first half, or anyone that reads this, if you have 
the first half of season 10, please seed, it seems to
be dead even though it says there is 1 seeder.
thank you, most appreciated!!"
,zillionnn,2007-11-28T21:05Z,"Thanks so much for these. I wish the show had lasted even longer :) I can only imagine how hard it was for you to seed all the seasons. Your efforts are highly appreciated!

missjenniferd, right now I can't, but tomorrow I'll start seeding again the first half. However, my upload speed is exremely bad, so I don't know if it'll be enough :("
,missjenniferd,2007-11-28T21:23Z,"thanks for the seeds on the first half, we now have 6 seeders!!!!! :P

most appreciated!!!

thank you zillionnn :P"
,Rapture.,2007-11-29T00:36Z,"Hi Humors
I missed the second part of season 8 - being Canadian I was banned long before the rest of the world
Is there any way you can upload it here?"
,Humours,2007-11-29T08:34Z,"okay I am reseeding some of the other seasons for a bit. I havent got them all on my puter but will try as much as possible! It took my nearly half a year to encode and seed them all, please help if you are able to seed!"
,moirainesedai,2007-11-30T05:16Z,"Maybe it's just me, but episodes 13-22 seem to be on here twice, and not the first half."
,Trissifyror,2008-02-06T18:14Z,"This is MUCH appreciated! Have searched for Murphy for a long time. Any chance you've got seasons one, two and three?? "
