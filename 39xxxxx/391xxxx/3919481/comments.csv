sounds like good fun"
[T],Knaster,2007-12-03T21:43Z,yeah i like games like these
[T],Knaster,2007-12-03T21:44Z,a very nice upload 
[T],Knaster,2007-12-03T21:45Z,but hey its an 2.58 gib exe file this cant be right??????
,maximusmurderous,2007-12-03T23:53Z,It is the full version this is how it comes on the DVD.  
,Romeoman,2007-12-04T07:24Z,"Could we have some more confirmation this is real? That is: working exe, no virus, no crack needed?"
[T],Knaster,2007-12-04T13:54Z,not until someone has downloaded it
,maximusmurderous,2007-12-04T17:12Z,Take my word for it.  I can assure you it is pucker I wouldn't have wasted my time uploading it if it wasn't ok.  I don't normally upload torrents but I spent ages trying to get this game and couldn't find it anywhere so I had to buy it.  Loads of people are having problems with the downloadable version because it requires a serial so I decided to upload the retail version to help them out.  The DVD comes with this file and a PDF manual and that is it.
,sirmattia,2007-12-04T21:15Z,"this version is protected by eLicense, like all versions"
,maximusmurderous,2007-12-04T22:57Z,No it isn't
[T],Knaster,2007-12-06T02:01Z,it seems upload  has stopped i noticed today when i check on it i had uploaded 15 gib and still was on 54% :/
,Bronthion,2007-12-06T09:24Z,"Seed, stuck on 54%"
,TeamPlayer,2007-12-06T13:24Z,"Yes, PLEASE SEED..  Also stuck at 54.6% along with 151 others at time of this typing...

TIA to anyone who takes the time to SEED this great game. If it completes I will seed for an additional 24-48 hours.  Every little bit helps."
,maximusmurderous,2007-12-06T14:16Z,I've just started seeding again now 
,eckaltu,2007-12-06T15:58Z,PLEASE SEED
,TeamPlayer,2007-12-06T22:16Z,"maximusmurderous  Thanks for starting the seeding again.  To bad the previous ""leechers"" took the program and ran without seeding for awhile.  Seems you're the only one at present.  Yesterday when I started d'loading I was getting over 200KB/sec (lots of seeds), now with only you I'm lucky to be getting 5KB/sec.  However, the SEEDING is much appreciated if you have the patience to continue."
,Romeoman,2007-12-06T22:40Z,"Yes, pls hang in there! If u manage to upload it and it works, you are a HERO! Nobody managed to crack TOW up until now..."
[T],Knaster,2007-12-07T00:10Z,Ehm TeamPlayer are u kidding me noone has even downloaded it yet. The reason ppl left were because they were stuck at 54% lmao so stop with asskissing 
,maximusmurderous,2007-12-07T01:05Z,I seeded it for ages and had to stop because I was playing quake.  I uploaded 8GB and assumed that was enough and other people would have completed it and then seed it themselves.  I will continue seeding it for a while until there are some other seeders.
,Bronthion,2007-12-07T13:31Z,"Amount uploaded can't be compared to number of completed dl's :D If there are many leecher's then you can upload 80GB and not one of them have a complete DL :P 
But great you're seeding again, great man :D"
,FreeMayk,2007-12-07T21:10Z,"Seed please!!! He stop on 84%!!!!! 
Thx in advance! :)"
,maximusmurderous,2007-12-07T21:32Z,Im seeding at the moment and not using my bandwith for anything else but considering so many people are after it my upload speed is really slow.  I will seed for as long as it takes but sorry if it takes a while.  The game is worth it though
,maximusmurderous,2007-12-07T21:33Z,please anyone who completes the download SEED please
,Romeoman,2007-12-07T22:33Z,I promise to seed at least 12 hours if it works as advertised!
[T],Knaster,2007-12-08T06:10Z,omg 90% now i may yet live to play it before christmas then lolz
,Bronthion,2007-12-08T12:31Z,"98,6% now...looks like i'll be playing tonight :)"
,FreeMayk,2007-12-08T12:45Z,"Bronthion you don`t play tonight!!! :D

[T],Knaster,2007-12-08T16:04Z,well atm we are 141 seeders hope that helps somewhat with your bandwith maximus

,maximusmurderous,2007-12-08T16:13Z,Excellent glad the download finished for you guys.  Hope you like the game

,FreeMayk,2007-12-08T17:03Z,"My game is crushed in loading!!!!! A try 5-times!!!
Why???"
[T],Knaster,2007-12-08T17:26Z,"and i cant install it, seems corrupt :( weird"
,maximusmurderous,2007-12-08T18:09Z,"Not sure why you are having problems seems ok for other people.

MAKE SURE YOU DO THE SETTING BEFORE PLAYING THE GAME.

If you still have problems check the website for help www.battlefront.com "
,Tzimm,2007-12-08T19:20Z,"Im getting runime error #3 (trap)

Any idea why, and how to get past this? :P"
[T],Knaster,2007-12-08T20:10Z,it finally worked for me i had to download again though cheers
,sanpogy,2007-12-16T10:35Z,"i downloaded and installed, when i launched the game it turned my desktop upside down, and gave me an error #3 and asks me to call the manufacturer of this program, im using a laptop so we have the rotate option, i tried reinstalling still no good... any advise would be appreciated.

ps. im downloading it again."
,sanpogy,2007-12-17T14:23Z,"someone help out seeding, when im done thats 24 hours seeding for me... thanks in advance..."
,maximusmurderous,2007-12-21T01:14Z,Try doing the graphics settings before starting the game I had loads of problems until I did that.  Also check the website www.battlefront.com for help.
,slippery1,2007-12-22T01:37Z,"i started out DL'ing at decent speed (28.0 kb) and now am down to about 6kb.. it has take a couple days but i'm at about 38%.. hopefully I'll finish before Xmas (5 days away). i'll seed for a while for sure.. it says that there are 10 seeders but I am only connected to one. It seemed to slow to a stop , .1kb , then I reloaded the trackers and I started out at about 8kb again. I hope this game works.. i've downloaded it before but needed a key.. hope this one goes well. will report back."
,sanpogy,2007-12-22T09:18Z,"after 3 weeks of downloading twice, installing, trouble shooting, reading forums, and shit like that just for this game, i here fore conclude that ""FUCK IT"" ill just play something else... usually you buy/download a game to play on your PC for this game its the other way around, you buy a PC to play this fucked up game. so FUCK IT."
,slippery1,2007-12-23T13:00Z,"this works fine for me.

the first time i tried to install it, the install crashed.. but i restarted my pc, and it installed no prob the 2nd time. if youre having trouble installing try disabling your anti-virus/security. this helped me. 

game looks cool! grafix r kidna weak but maybe i can turn the detail up.. havent checked or played the game more than a minute. 

props to maximus murderous, i've been waiting for this one to get posted.. ive dl'ed it a couple times but of course not a working version. thanks!! "
,aben1,2008-01-02T12:24Z,"Thx alot for this! Tried to Dl patch at battlefront.com! Didn´t get it to work tough...any1 knows any workaround to this...shouldn´t be any prob because Serial is the only protection and that´s fixed with the original version (this). 
Thx in advance ifa anyone knows how to solve this...And Happy New Year :D "
,aben1,2008-01-02T12:29Z,Im stupid its included... lol..omfg :D

,djsym1,2008-02-04T01:02Z,"same here, need key"
,djsym1,2008-02-04T01:21Z,"the ""uber patch"" just released when applied over this install requires a key"

Specs:
GeForce 8600GT 256MB
2GB BallistiX RAM
4800+ Dual core AMD
Any ideas why it laggs ? 
Thanks in advance"
,maximusmurderous,2008-03-06T22:21Z,"This version has several of the previous patches already along with the extra campaigns the new patch is only for versions bought through battlefront thats why it needs the serial. The UK retail version does not have a serial this is copied from the website

This ""All Inclusive Uber Patch"" is indeed all inclusive (cumulative) and includes the same fixes and game content that was featured in all of the earlier released patches. This patch can be applied to ANY previous version of the game that was purchased DIRECTLY from Battlefront.com. It is not intended for the any other version of Theatre of War that is available (Russian language version, the versions published by Kalypso Media, Friendware or Anuman etc&hellipalthough patches for those versions will be released shortly as well.

,namro99,2008-03-26T02:00Z,"Thanks Maximus.

The ""Uber"" patch now does a cd check.  If we could trouble you for a mini-image or even the original DVD name and file structure might work "
,littleone1,2008-03-29T21:45Z,Everytime I try to start the game it ask for License... Any idea how to get past it?
,littleone1,2008-03-29T22:06Z,"Ok, please ignore my comment, wrong torrent..Sowwy, great upload Maximus  :)"

,gurachn,2008-04-17T05:47Z,"It looks like the 1.78 GB torrents on Mininova are dead.
Is there another solution to getting the Uberpatch to run without the DVD?"
,barabas12,2008-04-24T13:50Z,"It works with; 

First install this game then get the 1.2GB uber update install it then use the http://www.shareonall.com/Overwrite_With_This_dll_zqfd.zip

But it has some minor errror like can`t use the misson, map and the battle generator !
Save the old mission editor of this version an copy later to youre TOW dir."

,TheGlock,2008-07-09T04:00Z,"I might have found a possible fix for the 1.10 Uber Patch problem.

Install Theatre of War

Download The Kalypso Uber Patch here:
ftp://ftp.1cpublishing.eu/Theatre_of_War/ToW_Eng_Kalypso_110081patch.exe

Now install the patch IN A SEPARATE FOLDER. (Not the ToW root directory)

Copy/Paste everything from the Patch folder to the ToW folder EXCEPT the ToW.exe file.

Download the 1.10 ToW.exe fix here:
ftp://ftp.1cpublishing.eu/Theatre_of_War/ToW.exe

Now replace it the ToW.exe in the ToW Root directory.

Delete the Patch folder.


Hopefully that should work, because it seems to be working for me. Comment after your results."
