                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Meet the little bracelet that raises big questions...

You've probably seen the retail displays. You've almost certainly seen the TV 
infomercials; they're everywhere. Probably you've wondered what the Q-Ray 
bracelet is and what it does.

The answer is a little complicated. The Q-Ray is a crescent of metal capped 
with a pair of metal beads. In the past it was marketed as a pain-relief device. 
Now, it is being marketed as a way to achieve "performance," balance" and 
"vitality," and also as something that will "balance the negative and positive 
energy forces in your body." All this is apparently the work of "ionization," 
which is a five-dollar word for electric charge.

We took a Q-Ray to an electron microscopy lab and had it analyzed in detail. 
The verdict? The thing is not ionized at all. Then Wendy Mesley sat down with 
Charles Park, the president of Q-Ray Canada.
