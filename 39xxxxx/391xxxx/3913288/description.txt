Sadly that I couldn't bundle a user guide of this release together with the product since Maeroris doesn't have much time to work on it and I already promised to release it in middle of this month (which seems to be late already). To be frank, this version is mainly the same to previous ones except "Aero Glass without WindowBlinds" and "WinFlip" featured with overall improvements such as:

-Fixed hotfix issue, no more workaround trick required to avoid that
-Ability to save transforming information for later uses and unattended transformation
-Ability to detect the targeted machine and give suggested setup configuration
-Some transformation procedures refinements you should look at like pre-configure on first run, removed obsolete dialogs and msn skin, etc.
-New 3rd-party apps and new version of existing apps

And yes, it's free still without paying few hundreds for some certain stuff you like in Vista.

For detailed changes and download , please a look below
