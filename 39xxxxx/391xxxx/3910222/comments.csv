,vegitax,2008-01-09T15:41Z,Could someone seed this please? 
,The Living Homer,2008-02-02T06:22Z,Thanks for this. Don't worry about the people bitching. I have a slow upload speed and when I upload videos it takes awhile. Thanks for this.
,The Living Homer,2008-02-02T17:27Z,"Okay, forget my first comment. I figured that you just had slow upload speeds. But apparently you're not even seeding because I'm stuck at 55.7%. If you're going to upload a torrent actually upload it. Not half way and then stop. Just because your ratio hits 1.0 that doesn't mean that one person has it."
,JerseyDevil1008,2008-02-11T18:48Z,55.8% ....  Seed already!
,CopperViking,2008-02-24T02:19Z,Is this just being seeded painfully slow or is it completely dead?
,1bones3,2008-03-11T13:08Z,"I'm the only one seeding this thing and I only have 55.7% downloaded. Download quit abruptly last night. I was getting near my max download speed on it. Come on people, seed!!"
,zorph,2008-03-15T12:49Z,been stuck at 59.9% for a week
,ferdiaob,2008-03-25T20:32Z,"Quit bitching people, I'm on 64% so clearly he is uploading, can I point out that with this many people he'd have to upload the 64% that's out there at least a couple times over, torrents take time some times, give the guy a break."
,Grobeh,2008-04-21T22:19Z,"Been on 64% for some time now. Had three of these since before (1, 4 and 6) so I'll seed with them. Hope someone else can share the others."
,ferdiaob,2008-05-09T19:50Z,"see? we have a seed, bittorrent wins again!!!1"
,saturday___,2008-05-16T23:25Z,"Please seed, Im stuck at 93%."

,Gh0ztly,2008-06-24T03:57Z,"One of, in not, the greatest comedians and progressive thinkers, of our time. God bless him. I hope all of you are seeding his torrents. Thank you George. In life and death, you have touched us all.
R.I.P."
,TheHawke,2008-06-24T15:09Z,"It is ironic isn't it? When George said ""If there is a God let Him strike me dead. God was so busy with war, famine, etc that it just took Him a while to get to George and on His day off too. George Carlin a great man and a free thinker, who do we have now? I'll miss him."
,Gh0ztly,2008-06-24T23:20Z,"Please Seed. I'm stuck at 93%. Is this a joke you guys are playing? If so, not so funny. I have 0 seeders and so many leechers. This is not fair! Please seed the phuckin thread!"
,YouDummy,2008-06-25T01:28Z,"For those stuck at 93%, all the files except ""You Are All Diseased"" will play all  the way through. ""You Are All Diseased"" plays about half way."
,Gh0ztly,2008-06-25T03:21Z,"Thanx. Not a funny joke! Especially, in the wake of such an icon. shame."
,MagusMainyu,2008-06-25T10:52Z,fuckin hit'n'runners!

,the_lee,2008-06-26T01:14Z,"SEED MOTHER FUCKERS!!!  If not, I hope you burn in hell!"
,ilive4harleys,2008-06-26T05:43Z,"For all those whining, stop. I do not see you uploading anything. Second, the man was 71. He lived a good long (not long enough granted) life and is now reunited with his first wife whom he loved dearly. And finally, of THAT generation of comics, Don Rickles is the only one left. He is 81 and still performing. G-D bless him. No one today can compare to these greats. Don Rickles was/is one of a kind. He is funny and an all around insulter. These days, it is okay for a black comedian to pop shit about whites but white comedians are racist if they make a black joke. Now we have Lewis Black, Bill Maher, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert as the political comedians. But they cannot stand up to the Carlins and Mort Sahls, etc.
George you lived a good life and we will miss you. HBO ran a marathon tonight. The only one not here is Playin With Your Head. George we hardly knew ye!!!!"
,lostboy69,2008-06-27T12:14Z,"@ ilive4harleys

,pourn,2008-07-02T02:59Z,"@ilive4harleys=one of the dumbest comments ever

wtf does your comment have to do with this torrent or anything anyone else has said on this torrent?

""These days, it is okay for a black comedian to pop shit about whites but white comedians are racist if they make a black joke.""

wtf?  i think you are forgetting one thing about all these black and white comedians, they are comedians, they tell fucking jokes.  don't take it too seriously."
,swordswallower,2008-07-22T13:59Z,"File 6: Carlin at Carnegie is 'glitch city' after 23 mins!! I have yet to find a good copy.
File 5: 'Doin it Again' is dead/the missing file.
File 4: Is missing the first piece, so good luck playing that one...

of course if the phantom seeder DOES exist we'll all be laughin'."
