,oneway23,2007-12-03T19:12Z,"Both Discs or just the first?  Either way, thanks for the up"
,oneway23,2007-12-03T19:14Z,Never mind..Looked inside the torrent...This is tremendous.  The 1st disc is retail and not a transcode of the original 160 kbps?
,chawknz,2007-12-03T19:15Z,"Both discs (Original In Rainbows and the bonus CD2) encoded at V0.

Super!"

,thewalrusisben,2007-12-04T00:54Z,now i feel bad for downloading the second disk. damn. just when i was happy about not pirating their last album too.
,doucet,2007-12-04T16:11Z,There seems to be some pops and click on track 6 of Disc 2; I don't recall it being in the lower quality rips I have. Could just have not noticed it before but it's kinda jarring.
