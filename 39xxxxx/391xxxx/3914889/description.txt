Waterworld is a 2004 album by the Leak Bros. The Leak Bros. is a rap duo comprised of underground rappers Cage Kennylz and Tame One. Every song on Waterworld is about the drug PCP.

The Leak Bros. made their first appearance on Cage's 2003 album Weatherproof on the song "Leak Bros.," which was also solely about PCP.

Every song on "Waterworld" is about PCP. The terms "wet," "leak," "sherm," "dip," "death," "angel dust," "dust," "purple rain," "embalming fluid," and "formaldehyde" are all street names for PCP, and are all frequently mentioned throughout the album. Lines such as "I smoked this dip once, got high for six months, twenty three days, six hospital stays and I missed lunch" graphically portray the dramatic effects of PCP. Cage and Tame One frequently mention "dipping" cigarettes, blunts and other smoking material in PCP. The track Leakie Leak is supposed to be a voice message left by a girl high on PCP, who claims "I'm dusted, and I want to bust a nut kid." Dusted is a slang term for being high on PCP.
