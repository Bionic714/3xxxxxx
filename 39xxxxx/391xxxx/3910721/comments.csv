,RainbowDissent,2008-02-03T13:13Z,"Brilliant collection, great quality scans."
,Varmgang,2008-02-29T14:19Z,"The comics in here are of good quality, however it misses the original Sin City story ( A hard goodbye). Do you have that as well bitspreader?"
,btkr3w,2008-05-23T19:29Z,what program do i use to view these?
,btkr3w,2008-05-23T19:36Z,nevermind...
,WilliamtheHun,2008-07-14T07:58Z,How do I look at these files?
,ace135,2008-07-17T21:49Z,to open these files you can get a special .cbz file viewer or the easiest just change all the .cbz extensions to .rar and open it with winrarand it will just be pictures that you can open with the picture viewer of your choice
,shawn9061,2008-08-01T08:06Z,"hey Varmgang did you know that ""The Hard Goodbye"" is also known as ""The Violent Marv""? I bet you didn't. Well now you know. Google next time."
,bitspreader,2008-08-16T22:58Z,"Good point ace135, but they are zipped. CBZ = zip, CBR = RAR."
,RiRi89,2008-08-20T22:57Z,"4 viewing comics, use this prog calld ComicRack, it haz x64 version 2!"
,sumdumnam,2008-09-07T08:27Z,"the Hard Boiled comics have pages out of order... at least #3 but maybe #1 & 2 as well (it's hard to tell, not a lot of dialogue to help verify continuity)

i'll be looking elsewhere for those"
,scott_ehm,2008-10-28T09:48Z,"Sweet, thanks! Just read Elektra:Assassin today and it's one of my favourite comics next to Watchmen and Dark Knight Returns. Good Quality!"
,psychoGMR,2008-12-02T02:31Z,"So it looks good, but i'm looking for an easier way to view an entire book without juggling windows or through a filmstrip. Any program suggestions? "
,psychoGMR,2008-12-02T02:49Z,Sounds like the program CDisplay is what I was looking for. Thanks
,yayo01,2008-12-28T05:50Z,Thank you!
,ratfink2007,2009-01-05T09:38Z,"OMG stop complaining about the format, just go and download comic rack. You can also rearrange the page order. Or just go buy the f'n comic. Whiners."
,doors420,2009-01-28T00:26Z,thx this saved me the trouble of finding frank millers daredevil in some ginormo torrent where i would have had to do a lot of research thx alot
,dawidio,2009-03-01T16:39Z,Too bad no Ronin...
,alienjesus,2009-03-20T04:50Z,some of the pages in dark knight strikes again are messed up...  either that or they didn't download right
,alienjesus,2009-03-20T22:12Z,it also seems to be missing several pages
,thesewaves,2009-03-25T18:56Z,awesome torrent. downloaded at 250 kB/s. thank you seeders!
,alienjesus,2009-04-19T07:45Z,"the episodes in violent marv are all out of order....

are they supposed to be that way?"
,alienjesus,2009-04-22T02:21Z,"a dame to kill for has a screwed up page also.

Either it didn't download correctly, or this torrent sucks."
,spiderr,2009-05-03T07:15Z,There is his Robocop Vs Teminator 4-part and the Robocop 9-part that Miller wrote... see they've got torrents too.
