,Sylar_66,2007-12-04T04:12Z,"My first torrent had a problem (I still don't understand why). It stopped at 99.8% So I uploaded this one to fix it.

Don't worry! This one is working 100%!

I deleted the broken torrent in < http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3910870/Battlestar_Galactica_Razor_Flashback_TvRip_Minisodes_1_to_7_-_(C > as I realized it turned into a trap. I did not do it earlier because I was hoping people could return to that page to complain and then read where they could find this fix.

If you downloaded that broken torrent, You will see this one will complete the file you've got in the same folder (at least for uTorrent users, I believe).

Once again: sorry guys :("
