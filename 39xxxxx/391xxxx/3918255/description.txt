This torrent includes english subtitles in the srt format for the video Antropophagus, it is primarely meant to be used with the version FatFuckFrank has uploaded to TPB. I had to resync the subtitle file in order for it to match with FFF's video, but unfortunately it is still a bit out of sync on some places.

Still, I think it is better than nothing, and it made it possible for me to watch Antropophagus and actually understand what was going on. I don't remember where I got the original srt file from.


I have included FFF's Antropophagus torrent in this distribution, but you can also find it here:
