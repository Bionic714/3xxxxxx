         Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3
                 (Also known as: Persona 3)

         The third in Atlus' unusually thought-provoking RPG series.
         In Persona 3, you play as a 17 year-old boy  who's just
         transferred schools. Immediately after entering his dormitory,
         he comes under attack of a mysterious Shadow enemy. With his
         unique ability to switch Personas rather than just summoning
         a single creature, he ends up becoming leader of a special
         extracurricular force attempting to defeat Shadow.

         Players get to experience school life in Persona 3. You take
         control of the main character during each day of school,
         controlling his school efforts, managing the dorm, and
         exploring the town, and your relationship with the community
         affects your battle skills. When the clock turns midnight,
         the world enters "Shadow Time", and the battles begin. Emerge
         victorious from a battle, and you earn new Persona Cards.
         These cards hold your Persona summons, and by combining cards,
         you can make a new Persona.

         ___________________________

         *We're glad to present you our first release as a group, and
          we can already tell you that it certainly won't be the last!
         *Our goal is to bring you undubs of better quality, so we're
          not as fast as some other guy, but we believe the finished
          product is worth the extra wait.
         *This project took a lot of our free time, so we hope that
          you'll enjoy it as much as we do. Persona 3 is an awesome
          RPG and it deserved all the effort we put into it.
