,johansjg,2007-12-03T16:34Z,Great! thanks
,Kotoba,2007-12-21T18:44Z,"There's a patch that will update the 2nd school semester bgm with a better one. The loop of the first one was too noticeable and therefore had to be fixed, also the music wasn't really good overall either. Anyway, the new track is way better, so you can patch it without hesitation. :)

,demonsnake,2008-01-17T13:29Z,"Link to the new patch doesn't work..any other places where one could be found?

Thx for the great release...in game music definetely rocks!! Though japanese voice acting makes the game sound authentic...sometimes I wish I could switch to english coz I just get tired of hearing something I can't understand"
,Kotoba,2008-01-27T22:06Z,"There was a couple things left to fix, so I made another patch. It should be the final one this time. ;)
(Btw it also includes the changes from 1.01)

Changes/Fixes:
*The 2nd school semester BGM is replaced with a better version (loop is no longer noticeable and the remixed track is overall better).
*Jin's battlevoices that were still in english are now in japanese.
*The last movie before the ending is now subbed (due to some fuckup while rebuilding the final version, that movie wasn't subbed like it should have been... :P).

Oh and this one works, I tested it and there's no error."
,Kotoba,2008-01-28T19:44Z,You can also find the 1.02 patch here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4000605
,fluffyllama,2008-02-07T09:47Z,"Hey Kotoba, is there a patch to revert music to original for version 1.2?"
,Kotoba,2008-02-07T21:00Z,"nope, but I can ma"
,Kotoba,2008-02-07T21:01Z,"nope, but I can make one. :)
i'll try to do that within the next few days and post it here."
,fluffyllama,2008-02-08T03:05Z,"Cool man, thanks!

Not to look down on any of the impressive work you've done so far, but I just prefer all the original tunes..."
,Kotoba,2008-02-10T18:19Z,"No worries. I knew some would prefer the original background music, that's why I made the 'oribgm' patch in the first place. ;)
But since everyone that I know of was using the remixed version, I didn't see the point to make a oribgm 1.02 patch.

Anyway, here's the 1.02 oribgm patch. :)

You'll have to apply the oribgm patch on the original iso and then apply this patch."
,fluffyllama,2008-02-10T21:58Z,Thanks dude!  Works great!
,jamisforjelly,2008-02-19T05:58Z,"THANKS for this!

I hate to ask, but does anyone have a lossless copy of the limited-edition soundtrack? Gamestop forgot to include it in my box (the bastards) and I don't relish a cross-state roadtrip to go back and get it.

(think of all the s.link points you could get for uploading it :D)"
,evilcaptain,2008-04-06T23:19Z,"Thanks for your effort. I own the original, but it never leaves the shelf now thanks to you.
Its fantastic that so many people are improving things for nothing but the most honorable of reasons! Bravo!"
,xKaworu,2008-04-21T22:23Z,"Hey Kotoba (or anyone else who can answer this), is this the English version with the original videos of the Japanese version or is it just the Japanese version with subbed videos?

I'm asking this because I heard P3 would only be released on USA on April 22, and that's tomorrow, so I'm wondering how could someone already have the USA version."
,Pennywis3,2008-04-22T22:59Z,"Hey xKaworu
actually what was released today was an expansion of persona 3. it's Persona 3 - FES - (Festival).

Persona 3 -fes- has all of persona 3 game plus an extra scenario (episode Aegis)."
,xKaworu,2008-04-27T18:57Z,"Oh, thanks for that. ^^ I actually figured it out the day after I posted this comment, but I forgot to post it here. ._. Thanks again, Pennywise. o/"
,Kinslayer120,2008-06-06T20:50Z,Hello. I am interessted in playing this game. But do i need a emulator to play it? or can i just use deamon tools? (kinslayer = noob) plz help:)
,bluehornet23,2008-08-14T18:46Z,Hey Kotoba  I have a question to ask I just found persona 4 for ps2 but the game is broken into 52 file how do i make them just two big file or one big file like the game disk ? if you want i can send you the game  so you can see what you can do .
,Angelic_Pretty,2009-01-20T09:12Z,"This looks really promising; However, a few more seeds would be nice... 

I find this torrent just as I am 96% done with my full English one *sigh*. Such is life."
,lelesh,2009-05-30T21:12Z,"Thanks! Fully donwloaded ad seeding.

So, what should i do now? I have a PS2 emulator, should I uncompress all the rar files??
Ok, thanks for the torrent, I hope you can support me to be able to play it ^^"
,Blackflag421,2009-07-22T07:18Z,"Many thx to Kotoba, more than a couple people suggested I try this game out when I asked them for ps2 rpg's to play.  More than I hoped for to not only find in on TPB, but without shitty voiceacting!  I'll be seeding this 15+gigs :)"
