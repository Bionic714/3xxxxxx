,catmana,2008-02-07T04:36Z,hey im kinda new to this stuff when i watch it with windows move player all i get is sound
,swofford,2008-02-22T21:50Z,"hey guys if you want some picture with the sound you better download VLC media player, it plays all sorts of stuff that the usual media player doesn't. =) "
,zerokool1981,2008-03-14T04:59Z,"what kinda file is this?
"
,Global_Entrepreneur,2008-04-27T10:41Z,"Hey Samb, not to sound ungrateful, but since it is your first release, maybe you'd want some feedback? Overall quality is great, but it would be even better if you cropped the movie before encoding it (don't worry too much: Deathmule hasn't figured it out yet, either). When watching the movie on a hardware player, like Popcornhour, it scales down the whole picture for the black bars to fit in - AND it uses way too much filecapacity since the encoding filters can't handle the black too well. Keep up the good work."
,white_za,2008-06-30T23:32Z,"just a suggestion, but the video;Resoultion, and bitrate, and audio, channels and bitrate in the info. but otherwise good one :)"
