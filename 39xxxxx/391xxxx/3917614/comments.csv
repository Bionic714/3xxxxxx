,ErRasmus,2008-05-10T10:22Z,Subtitles seem to not be working at all. What player are you using that allows you to access them? Media Classic Player does not.
,sportslayer,2008-05-12T21:12Z,they can be played using Media player classic that comes with CCCP though selecting them by right clicking the image and selecting subtitles does not work but as soon as you open the video a green arrow apears in your system tray that you can right click and select them. you can check http://www.vegapunk.com/forums/index.php?topic=61 for more details though that is a guide for using softsubs so there is alot of unnecesary info there but it covers all you need to know
,magdalene,2008-10-26T03:38Z,Thanks for this.  I'm completely full of nerdlove for this movie.

,sportslayer,2009-12-10T12:40Z,"Yes the subs at subscene do sync, i used the same DVD to rip both the movie and those subs"
