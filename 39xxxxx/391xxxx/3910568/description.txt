The Supreme Beings of Leisure's sophomore effort starts out sounding like an ultra-chic doppelganger to the Spice Girls. But once the first two tracks have plodded away to their respective holes in the ground, "Catch Me" streaks from the gate, an expansive wash reminiscent of early James Bond film themes ? slinky and seductive, mixing happy pills with martinis. Close on its heels is "Get Away," an enthusiastic pumper reminiscent of the Propellerheads.
