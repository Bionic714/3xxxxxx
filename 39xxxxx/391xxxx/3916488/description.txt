The Global Processing Unit (GPU) is a collaborative world-wide effort to build the first giant Internet Supercomputer. This giant supercomputer will be used for open, free and peaceful research purposes only. There are many examples of collaborative efforts which are succesful like the Wikipedia, Debian and its Linux kernel to build a free operating system, One Laptop Per Child which aims to donate a laptop to each child in developing countries. GPU would like to convey efforts from the Open Source Community to build the first giant supercomputer, built, supported, documented and run by volunteers.
