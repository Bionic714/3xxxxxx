Ojala que trabaje este!!"
,zeroexcelcior,2007-12-10T00:36Z,"cata_rapper, do you know of a fix for the ""wargame-g4wlive.exe"" error? the game runs  if you just ignore it, but it lags graphicly."
,shadow995,2007-12-14T16:45Z,it wont let me play it!!!!!!!! it keeps saying put in the disk what the hell
,Donelop,2007-12-16T22:55Z,Does any one want to seed?
,zeroexcelcior,2007-12-18T03:22Z,"This is probably not clear to most people so i'm pointing it out now. to play the game you need to copy the ""startup.exe"" from ""razor1911"" and put it in place of ""startup.exe"" in ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Gears of War\Binaries"". I don't remember if you have to do this for the install, but I don't think so. The game does run!
Also: Play the game in windowed mode so if you get the ""wargame-g4wlive.exe"" error you can just set it aside and ignore it."
,AustinPwndU,2008-01-02T07:10Z,PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE!!!! SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED!!!! IM BEGGING YOU SEEED FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SEEED!!!!! AHHHHHH!!! =| need seed. =D i'll love you for ever if you do! =DDDD!!!! SEED NOW!

Follow the link sent by cata_rapper below, then copy that as the new setup.  Outstanding work.  Many thanks to whomever is responsible for this.  I will seed all day during the week while I'm at work."

,lully,2008-07-15T04:37Z,"It wouldnt let me play cause i didnt have the latest video driver for my 7900 GS...

you may need the INF (place into the extacted driver folder) to install onto a laptop tho"

,farphignougen,2009-11-26T09:01Z,"For some reason the game won't start unless you set your computer's date back a year or so.  In researching this problem I found a Microsoft patch for the game that supposedly fixes the problem.  The game worked with just setting the date back, but I didn't get past the main menu without thinking ""the game works fine, but it's annoying having to set back my date,"" so I ran Microsoft's patch.  Now the game throws a Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime error on startup.  Even when I uninstall and reinstall the game, it doesn't work anymore.  The game's now fucked, and it's entirely my fault.

Short version: Set your computer's date to sometime in 2008 and the game should work fine.  Don't bother trying any official solution to this problem."

,danutmh,2010-12-24T10:31Z,"guys i allways get an error that WarGame-G4WLive.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close.
please help"
,SomeKidBen,2011-04-28T23:16Z,"How is it that any of you got this to work. 

I install it, put the provided crack and tried others and it tells me.

C:/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Gears of War/Binaries/wargame-g4wlive.exe: You cannot run the game with modified executable code. Please reinstall the game.

I have tried reinstalling without a crack and it just asks for the correct DVD and I also tried reinstalling with other cracks and its always the same outcome.

I have all the latest Windows Live dll's and registries. What is the problem? Am i doing something wrong. Unless someone knows how to fix this problem its a big -1 from me."
