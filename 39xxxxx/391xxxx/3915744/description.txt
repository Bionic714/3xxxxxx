Pax Galaxia is a fast paced and addictive real time strategy game, based on the board game Risk. You will be amazed at the strategic depth of this game, even if it is very easy to learn and play. You will have to conquer stars, break up, and force your enemies fleets to surrender, carry out rapid attacks, and tactical retreats. Multiplayer modes are available (online and by taking turns on a single computer). A level editor is included.

2. Copy PaxGal.exe from crack folder to installed folder.
3. Enjoy! :P
