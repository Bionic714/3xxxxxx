,etherc,2007-11-27T05:21Z,Thanks!  I'm looking forward to this.  Can I ask why the great majority of peers are still at 0.0% while only a couple have double digits?  Is this a seeding strategy?

,Minerva.TheGift,2007-11-28T06:28Z,"Thanks for the upload, and thanks for all your HDTV uploads! I finally got the chance to watch this tonight, and it looked great!  In case anyone is wondering, it plays fine on a Windows PC and on a Mac (using VLC media player, which is available for multiple platforms.)  I'll try to seed to at least a 1.000 share ratio.
