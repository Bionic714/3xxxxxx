,PocketPoop,2007-11-29T17:34Z,can anyone confirm that this is legit and working?
,kunnoichi,2007-11-30T22:53Z,ive tried getting them working but I get an error saying the process requires elevation  no idea what this is. Ive downloaded 5 different versions on here  and all are the same
,fukvista,2007-12-02T03:16Z,"To Solve the elevation permission/rights issue just google ""activate hidden administrator vista"" I had the same issue with some games and this will fix.
Just more Vista bullshit to get software to actually work! 
I'm happy to say I'm Back on XP!  "
,acelunatic,2007-12-13T13:20Z,"This is the second version on RS I've had, and it has the exact same problem. For any language, in the part of a lesson where the program says something and you're to record yourself repeating it (and it grades you), the program's voice is very high-pitched and sounds like a chipmunk. I have even tried the discs on other machines, and the same thing happens. Is this happening for everyone else as well?"
,superturk,2007-12-17T20:14Z,"How do you install the languages? It says that ""No languages where found"" "
,bumbi,2007-12-22T06:42Z,"I also have the same problem with the sound, when Im going to use the speech req, the program speakers voice sounds like Donald Duck on metaamphetamine! Solution anyone? m using Vista 32"
,ghanafirst,2007-12-26T15:41Z,Hello road rocket can you please help me on how to install the language pack because it says no language data found thanks............ nice upload
,mehransrv,2007-12-27T17:14Z,I need Rosetta stone V3 thanks!
,FourMoreYears_72,2008-01-01T03:05Z,"I got this to download properly, but I can't get the languages loaded.  

So when the program says ""No languages found"" how do you get it to work?"
,atmead450,2008-01-01T20:34Z,There are no SEEDERS!!! Please see!
,DPio,2008-01-04T04:39Z,"Works good with me!!  I tried Spanish & Portuguese and no problems with voice at all.  Due to me having Vista I did have to run as administrator.  Great u/l, thanks road_rocket!"
,grfd567,2008-01-05T04:41Z,"TO ALL THOSE PPL GETTING ""NO LANGUAGES FOUND"" I got that same message too and I finally got it to work...
At first I opened the .iso with ISObuster and extracted files and installed. After which i started the program and ran the program, which was when i got that same message. 
So after i uninstalled and ran the .iso in a virtual drive, such as with the Alcohol120% tool, and run the installation from there...it should be fine when you start the program. Hope this helps"
,jtwiller,2008-01-06T23:23Z,is this the app and the language packs. are the language packs unlocked?

,mojopagoda,2008-02-02T09:50Z,maybe we should just speak chipmunk
,stupid m0nkey,2008-02-03T04:14Z,"you guys r stupid, to run on vista go to computer, then right click the disc drive where it is, click explore, then right click setup.exe and click run as administrator


vista does not have active administrative control, it's a security flaw in XP"
,stupid m0nkey,2008-02-03T04:15Z,sorry archangel
,stupid m0nkey,2008-02-03T04:18Z,"i was just mad at fukvista cuz he is retarded

thanks"
,tarantino5,2008-03-11T21:26Z,23
,playa141,2008-04-15T17:21Z,"davetherave88:
1) Extract the file using PowerIso, Magic ISO Maker or any other software
2) Install the software
4) Reboot
5) Mount the ISO file (the one you downloaded) onto a virtual drive using the above software or burn it onto a CD

If you burned a CD: Insert the CD
If you mounted it onto a virtual drive: Don't do anything

6) Have fun!"
,champagnesprnva,2008-05-02T22:01Z,really good version. 
,martijnboersma,2008-05-06T22:14Z,I've got the chipmunk problem too! Is there a solution for this?
,jjackffrost,2008-06-04T18:45Z,Chipmunks are a pain the only way i found to get rid of them was to take a 1: 5 gallon bucket and fill it up to about half full of water. then get a 2: big bag og sunfower seeds srinkle them over the water so it looks solid run a 3: 1 x 1 across the top and 4: set it out where your chipmunks are. you get two or 3 a day in a week the problem is over.
,zack265,2008-06-19T04:28Z,"i need some help please, 

i converted the iso using disc utility on a mac to a .dmg file. however i cant burn it because its 2.63 gb  and i dont have a dvd burner. 
how do i virtually mount like davetherave mentioned? 

thanks for the help"
,zack265,2008-06-19T04:45Z,also is there a special rosetta stone for macs? 
,Chiana_Rei,2008-06-23T15:14Z,"acelunatic and others 
the ""Chipmunk problem is probally due to the program not interfacing well with your sound card with the initial settings.  One way to fix it is to open up your volume control and play with the sliders till it sounds right, Im still downloading it but if you look in the program there is most likely a menu for manipulating the sound output as well.  Remeber you cant ""break"" your computer with most software so just play with stuff to get it right.  Ill check it after I get it and install it and give you an update."
,Ranoosh,2008-11-20T02:54Z,"Rosetta Stone, it gives me a message saying...
