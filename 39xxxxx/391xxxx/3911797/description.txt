There where three different language menus. I left only english menus. Animations after every button are removed. Menus before warnings (which only selects warning language) I removed totally. There was 11 Video Title Sets (VTS), I deleted 10 of those and left only VTS1 where the movie is. Then I had to manually edit PGC commands and button commands. 
If you look my version with DvdRemake Pro you find there is no "red lines". Who makes movie versions, knows what I mean.

I did not find good enough version of this movie, to compare to mine version. But I dont have to find. I know my quality.

Sorry about removed DTS audio. 
There is a sample and high resolution finnish cover
