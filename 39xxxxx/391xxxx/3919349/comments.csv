,LezDawson,2008-08-31T00:41Z,"Man, how could you?  This is such a fine album (even better than their first) and you've compressed it to shit.  Try this format: 320kbps CBR, joint stereo, LAME and you'll have something that approaches CD quality.  Sure, the files are a bit larger, but well worth the gains. :)"
,TimCereja,2009-03-28T02:59Z,"One of my favorites. It's worth getting a better bit rate, though ... "
,MonkeyPirate419,2009-07-20T04:14Z,"this is just sad! m4a is better than mp3, but 612KB for a song? thats pathetic!"
