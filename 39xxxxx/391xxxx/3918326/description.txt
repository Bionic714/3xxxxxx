Love Serenade is a 1996 Australian feature film directed by Shirley Barrett. It is a comedy film which has the tagline: "Two sisters will do anything to hook the right man."

There are not many characters in Love Serenade, which is set in an almost-deserted outback town called Sunray. We're introduced to a pair of sisters, Dimity (Miranda Otto) and Vicki-Ann (Rebecca Firth), who share a house. Dimity, the shy and insecure sibling, is a waitress at a local Chinese restaurant. Vicki-Ann, the brash one, is a hair stylist. Both are looking for love, although the prospects in Sunray seem bleak, at best. That is, until Ken Sherry (George Shetsov) moves into the house next door.
