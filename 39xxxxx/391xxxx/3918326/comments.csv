,randomdude42,2008-07-12T21:43Z,Still stuck at 91.5% Can someone please seed the rest?
,norwaynights,2008-08-25T04:15Z,"Same for me, stuck at 91.5% for over a week now."
,papergun,2010-02-14T02:12Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS.

I've been at 91.5% for 4 weeks now, along with 60 others.

Reading the above comments, it looks as though the other 8.5% has gone un-seeded for over 2 years. This torrent is not happening."
