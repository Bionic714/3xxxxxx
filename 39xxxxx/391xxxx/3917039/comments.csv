,SoundOfEmotion,2008-02-16T03:47Z,"There is missing content between files 128.mp3 and 129.mp3

The entire beginning of Book III: Chapter 7 is missing.

128.mp3 ends: ""don't tremble so. I have saved him.""

129.mp3 begins: ""Mr. Cruncher, with some difference, explained himself as meaning 'Old Nick's'.""

Missing first 12 paragraphs of Chapter 7!

sehnt, if you still check this torrent - please make the missing file available (128b.mp3) somwhere on the web (rapidshare, etc)."
,SoundOfEmotion,2008-02-16T03:50Z,"Actually, track 129.mp3 begins: ""Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.""

This means the first 20 paragraphs of Book III: Chapter 7 are missing.

Other than this, the rip is great quality. I am turning this into an audiobook with chapter art, so if I can complete the audio, I will reseed the full audiobook as an .m4b file with chapters and chapter art, etc."
