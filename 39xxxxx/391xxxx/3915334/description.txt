EATING RAOUL - The 1982 Cult Classic!  

  This low budget, wacky comedy pokes fun at the swingers lifestyle of the 70's and became a surprise box office hit in 1982 when it was released. It has developed a huge cult following ever since.

  It is the zaney story of a mild mannered, conservative couple who dream of opening a Restaurant in the country, only to see their dream thwarted by the crude, vulgar and insensitive people around them (Swingers). They stumble upon a scheme (and a "Frying Pan") that will both rid society of this scum, and at the same time raise money for their dream.
