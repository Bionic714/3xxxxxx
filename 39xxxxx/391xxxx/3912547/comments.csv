,skunkriverjJoe,2008-03-04T10:07Z,Thank you. This is exciting. I really dug the movie and I can't wait to listen to this! Thanks again.
,Dns74,2008-05-21T10:02Z,"Wow, as always, they ruin a perfectly good soundtrack by having different people sing the song. I'm not saying I want Dylan to sing them. I have those. I want to music that was in the movie, and this ain't it. If you are looking for a good collection of Dylan music that you can feed to your Dylan hating friends, this is it, but if you want to hear the songs you heard in the movie, search on. Great quality, just not what I wanted. "

,dazkenna,2008-07-27T13:31Z,this is a really great download.well played sir
,betamaxDK,2008-08-03T16:14Z,Well I'm a Dylan fan and I find this to be an amazing soundtrack (I like the Acapulco-cover better than the basement tapes version actually). Many of the songs in the movie are covers but if you want a list of the dylan songs i'd recommend you go to imdb and check out their forums. Have in mind that many of the songs are bootlegs so if you only have regular dylan albums you may have to look for em a bit...
,JohannGG,2008-10-01T09:06Z,Cat Power! Best cover of a Dylan song ever. I love Dylan but hate Dylan Covers but Cat Power ROCKS!
,gkalai12,2009-02-28T23:22Z,"Thanks a bunch;
it is rather important, though, to mention that music from tracks 1-5, 7, 8, 12 (first cd) and 6, 11-14, 17 and 18 (second cd) are the only ones heard in the film.

,killerkazama11,2009-04-18T06:23Z,Thanks for this. I really like The Black Keys cover of Wicked Messenger. Badass cover.
