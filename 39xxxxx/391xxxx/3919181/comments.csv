I hope you enjoy my torrents.  If so, please seed them as long as possible.

Thanks!"
,FadedMemory,2007-12-03T14:28Z,"heh, I didn't realize there were spambots that troll this site.  

I am seeding, but I assume from the fact that your post came up a few seconds after I uploaded the torrent, and that you are advertising your site's url,  that you muse be a spambot 'fwkejoeiiieiei'.

Well, at least it's kinda feedback  ;)"
,FadedMemory,2007-12-03T16:20Z,"Ok, ignore my last post ;)
The spambot's post was removed...    
Keep up the great work, thepiratebay.org admins "
