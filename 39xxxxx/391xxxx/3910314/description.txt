This is a great film.  Fun for the kids (probably PG), as well as for adults with an appreciation for British humour.


IMDB 6.9 out of 10 stars

Kevin, an imaginative child, goes on a time-travelling adventure with a bunch of treasure-hunting dwarves, who have "borrowed" a map to the Universe's time holes from The Supreme Being.  Written by Stewart M. Clamen {clamen@cs.cmu.edu} 


As a kid, I loved this, and would have given it 9 out of 10 stars, personal rating.
