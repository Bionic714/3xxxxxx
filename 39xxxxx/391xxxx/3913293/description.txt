The Striders are a 4 piece Psychedelic Dream Pop band from Danbury,
CT.  Formed in 2003 by Jayson Munro with Dave Corsak on drums and Matt
Stevens on second guitar, the band's lineup has evolved in dramatic
ways since then. In the fall of that year the group lost Matt and
gained Travus Palmer. Travus started off on bass and eventually moved
to rhythm guitar and backing vocals. After this lineup change The
Striders have had a great number of bassists: Chris Cestari, Matt
Corsak (Dave's older brother), Rick Visser (of tapereelsforeyes.com), 
Jeremy Lazaro and finally Joe Andrews.

With Joe wielding the bass The Striders have finally found their
perfect lineup.  The group, fresh off their 2006 hiatus, return to the
stage with a brand new EP titled "Between Scylla and Charybdis".  The
bloated seven song EP show the dream pop quartet reaching in new
directions.  Extending to the margins the simple clean-toned guitar
pop, The Striders move towards a more sonically open sound, with
experimentation and lavishly adorned textures, oozing energy from the
edges, the group take each song to the next level; continuing their
journey towards psychedelic dream pop ecstasy.

In short, if you like fun, well written power pop songs then this
album is for you.  Get the album, be happy!
