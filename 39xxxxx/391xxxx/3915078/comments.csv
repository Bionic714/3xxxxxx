No definite info yet on if this movie is supposed to be available in widescreen, but this release is fullscreen and the aspect ratio used for this encode is incorrect, making the film look ""squeezed"" thinner. If you set the aspect ratio in VLC to ""221:100"" you can watch the film in feux widescreen and the ""squeezing"" (now horizontal) is less noticeable IMO. As for if this movie is any good... well, low budget slasher film with cheesy acting, ends with the most unoriginal and poorly conceived way possible (The End?). If that doesn't deter you then you'll probably like it."
