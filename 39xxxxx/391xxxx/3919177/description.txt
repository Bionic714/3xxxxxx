Director Juan Carlos Claver, Spain/2006


Part love story, part harrowing history lesson, this gritty, touching drama looks at the stark impact of Spain?s ?social danger? laws, which persecuted gays and lesbians well into the 1970s.

The powerful opening scene shows how Elvira, a middle-aged, deeply-troubled woman, is saved from a suicide attempt, only to be charged with the murder of her lover, Pilar. This scene becomes a compelling backdrop for Elvira?s memories, which unfold, piece by piece, like a detective novel, under the gentle guidance of a sympathetic forensic psychologist.
