Remember to keep at least 1.0 share ratio, and if you're worried about how much you download, then use PeerGuardian2 (http://phoenixlabs.org/); it will prevent your computer from receiving or sending data to anti-p2p organizations, government, spam, and fake-file servers.  Also, I gotta give my thanks to thepiratebay.org, without which this torrent would not be possible.  When I started uploading, I made accounts at all the major torrent sites, and each account has been banned without explanation: Mininova, Meganova, and now, Torrentportal.  Torrentspy stopped servicing North America and now it's just ThePirateBay.org and BTmon.com who'll accept my torrents.  Of course, only TPB viewers get my posts on torrents. =)  Thanks, and enjoy the show!"
,skinnypimp419,2008-01-03T20:26Z,NO SOUND at all on any of the episodes... whats up with that???? what good is watching a mute tv show
,BloodLogic,2008-01-23T02:54Z,"Hey, Skinnypimp...  What's more likely?  (A) That I got the rips of these from someone else distributing to a large network, watched them, didn't notice that there was no audio like everyone else, and then reuploaded them to ThePirateBay.org?  Or, (B) It was uploaded just fine and perfectly ripped, but your video player doesn't have the proper mpeg codecs to support the format?  All you gotta do, is download VLC Player, and play it in that.  Download it 100% free forever at videolan.org, and it'll play any video/audio file period.  Especially for ""acquired media,"" heh heh.  Keep piracy alive, my brothers and sisters!"
