Doggy Fizzle Televizzle (Season 1)
[Snoop Dogg's Show] (MTV & MTV2)

Ripped by Unknown,
Carried by Eftydub to MySpleen.Net,
Finally released to the public by BloodLogic

Starring: Snoop Dogg, Christian Redd, Cris Borgnine, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Vanessa Villalovos
IMDB Review: Very Funny! Even if you are not a hardcore rap fan (which I'm not), it's still a very good skit show with Snoop being creative and coming up with different ways of making you laugh. I did have the honor of going to his concert once and he just knows how to entertain and work the crowd which he does on his show now.
