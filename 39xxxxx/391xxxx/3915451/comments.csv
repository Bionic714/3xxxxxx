In any case, it ruined the hebrew script I typed into the last comment.

Being crafty, though, I put the hebrew in Western character set as well.

>.<  technology is so...   reliable.

Stay safe.  May peace shine on the holy land again.

Shalom Shalom Shalom.

As far as the rest of you lot (non Yiddish speaking), I think ""cheers"" will suffice.

I haven't ever seen anyone from a predominately Moslem nation attach to my box.

Do Moslems watch movies?
