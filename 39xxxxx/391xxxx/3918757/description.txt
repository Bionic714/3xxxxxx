SHAMPOO - 1975

  Warren Beatty stars as George Roundy, a hairdresser who, it seems, ends up sleeping with everyone he does hair for. Goldie Hawn is his girlfriend Jill, who is pushing him to open up his own shop.
  The movie pokes fun at Mr. Beatty's own image and he plays the role as a dimwit who knows he's not too bright, but doesn't care.
  Watch for Carrie Fisher, of Star Wars fame, in her first movie role.
