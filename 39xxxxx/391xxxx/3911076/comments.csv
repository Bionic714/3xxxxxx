,MrSlisk,2008-09-15T22:32Z,Thanks for this torrent (:
,Trent5281,2008-09-17T18:01Z,"For you numptys blaming this guy for your torrent not working you really should have a word with yourselves.Firstly all this guys is providing is a game that works on his system.That doesn't mean it will work on yours without any tinkering,you might but lucky but as most of us have dual cores or quad cores certain older games need editional software to run.I can tell you that those people who are getting the error negative delta time why dont you try googling it like I did.For me & my system the reason I get this error is because I needed a dual core optimser which can be found on amd's website.As soon as I installed that the game now works.If you think I sound harsh its because I get fed up of people blaming the uploader if their shit don't work.Why don't you focus that energy on finding a solution & share it with the rest of us!(End of rant)
