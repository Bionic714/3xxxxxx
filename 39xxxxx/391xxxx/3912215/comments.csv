,Ripco,2007-12-04T23:04Z,"Thanks again deathmule.  P.S. I heard a rumour that due to the writers strikes in USA, thats the end of Heroes.  Dont fuel the rumour mill on the basis of that though, just what I heard.  I hear lots of voices, usually telling me bad things ;)"
,speakeasy,2007-12-05T00:40Z,"Mmm . . . well I saw that the last episode of this season was just broadcast.  But it must have been filmed ages ago.  Can't see how the strike could have affected anything.
Well, just took a look at tv.com and found this:

So, your source is partly right . . ."
