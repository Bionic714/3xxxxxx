,vo0ta5tic,2007-12-02T13:10Z,Give a comment ive you want more of these installers.
,cheng2007,2007-12-02T16:01Z,does this version contain the commentary? Just making sure
,preske,2007-12-06T22:34Z,"I've downloaded it and can say it works perfectly. the installer is pretty easy and fast. 
The only thing i didn't like is the ""c, d or e"" choises. I don'like to t install games on my C, d is my backupdisk, and E is my dvd-writer. i'ld rather choose my own disk.
But other then that, great work man."

,buggerlugs,2007-12-07T20:01Z,"thanks for uploading this - great game!

@solidacid - grow up or go and play wow."
,catachan,2007-12-08T05:43Z,"The setup worked well, the torrent downloaded exceptionally fast (20 minutes!), but for some reason, when I try to play the game, it says I need Direct X 8.0 or highter, and I have the latest version of Direct X. Help please?"
,Peasant Dave,2007-12-09T23:54Z,Please Seed!!!
,chinasyndrome999,2007-12-11T01:22Z,"had the same problem as catachan, said I needed at least DirectX8 when I have 9.0c. Anyone figured this out yet?"
,Moffs,2007-12-11T06:56Z,I got a problem. When I start the game I can see the tingys that comes first but when the menu (guess its some sort of menu) comes up the screen gets all white. Help? :/ 
,torehan7,2007-12-16T16:09Z,"hey, i;m running vista. and for some reason when i try running the .exe it doesnt even start. please help!"
,TheSilverDragon,2007-12-17T09:25Z,"Great torrent, no viruses, runs perfect, except a texture or two being missing near the end of the game, but no big deal. And for those of you who are having problems:

Make a shortcut to hl2.exe on your desktop. Right click it and click Properties. At the end of the Target box, add:

-game portal -dxlevel 81 +mat_forcehardwaresync 0

Now the game should come up and run fine. You can use the regular shortcut again now; after you run the other shortcut once, the changes are permanent. Hope this helps ^^

NOTE: MY FIX MAY OR MAY NOT WORK FOR VISTA. I ACCEPT NO LIABILITY SHOULD YOUR COMPUTER A SPLODE."
,C01eMaN,2007-12-18T06:12Z,"and remember... if u like this game buy it... i downloaded it first, thought this is brilliant how can i say thanks for it... oh yea ill buy it so i did :) "

,drazah,2007-12-22T05:45Z,"Alright guys, this is what i did and it worked. Download ImgBurn and get a blank dvd or whatever you got. Burn the ISO Image to the CD or DVD using ImgBurn, and after it is finished it should autorun."
,Gamedweler,2007-12-24T18:59Z,"Yeah, So I Have Vista Also. Burned It And Installed It But When I Launch It Nothing Happens."

,compos_mentis,2008-01-02T16:56Z,Thank you so much vo0 I don't care too much about the rest of the box (though I'm sure they're good games) and really didn't want to have to download a whole 9GB file just to play Portal. Now I just hope my computer can run it.
,bosduif,2008-01-03T10:31Z,"oke i downloaded this torrent, it was really fast thanks for that. I've instalded like you told us to,  when i start the game the intro from Valve works, and the ""powerd by source"" srceen.

,secretx123,2008-01-07T02:10Z,"gamedwelder I get the same probelm!!!

I'm running it on my dad's laptop, which is to the best of my knowledge a fairly standart Dell Inspiron 6400.....
It has the specs to run this game (Unlike my PC, which I WANTED to run it on) but it always crashes after I try walking through the first portal!! :("

I cant fire Red Portals!!!  The game clearly identifies my key for sec fire (mouse 2), but no red portal is fired responsible to my right click.
I even have tried bind another key to ""Secondary Fire"", still nothing happens...  :(
Now i get jammed on the 3rd floor !!!
Seriously need help!!!!!!!"
,dhuman3000,2008-01-13T23:18Z,"I got it installed. Just one problem, I go to click on it. It says loading and then it stopps and goes black. Then it goes to my desktop and tells me that I need DirectX 8.0 or better to play. So I go and download directx 10.0 and I still get the same error message. I don't Get it. Help please?"
,Marshmallowest,2008-01-20T03:01Z,"Okay, I installed everything with no problems, but when I run Portal, it gets to the loading screen, and then tells me I need to have at least DirectX 8 to run it. I currently have DirectX 9 installed on my computer. Would this problem be somehow related to an error while installing Portal, or is it something else?"
,TimeStopper,2008-01-20T03:46Z,You can't fire red portals until you've unlocked them.
,Marshmallowest,2008-01-20T14:53Z,"Okay, I read SilverDragons solution on the DirectX problem, but where exactly in the target box should I past ""-game portal -dxlevel 81 +mat_forcehardwaresync 0""? Whenever I paste it in there somewhere it tells me that it is invalid."
,lordztitan,2008-01-21T19:51Z,hello can someone help me with the white screen problem i can hear the menu music but it just stays white =( much appreciated o btw my email is brnmick@yahoo.com

,loki309,2008-01-24T05:48Z,"I'm having the same problem as a few people, the download and installation went great, but whenever the first portal opens, or it opens and I walk through it, the game crashes. 

Anyone have any suggestions for fixing it? Thanks in advance. "
,roguebatleth,2008-01-25T02:43Z,I installed it and opened it and it is telling me that I need DirectX 8.0 or higher and I aleady have that. Can anyone help me
,Doc Lithius,2008-01-25T13:03Z,"Alright.  As far as I can tell, this version is mostly complete.  I say ""mostly"" because it's missing ""ambient\machines\usetoilet_thank.wav"" (the toilet saying ""Your business is appreciated.""), the Developer Commentary (Chapter 1 in Commentary Mode refuses to load due to the missing commentary), and a few minor things here and there.  Plus, I'm not sure the purple areas of the game are supposed to be purple.  It only seems to happen when I'm running Steam at the same time (so I can play with the Achievements).  Dunno what's up with that, honestly.  But the important thing is that all the voicework seems to be intact.  Also, absolutely NOTHING has been unlocked right from the get-go and there's no save games in the archive.  I like this because it gives me a chance to unlock things on my own.
Lastly, if you don't want it installed to ""X:\Program Files\Portal by vo0\"", just move the ""Portal by vo0"" directory anywhere you want it.  The game will still run just fine no matter where it is and even recognize Steam (so you can do the Achievements thing I mentioned earlier) but doesn't show you as playing the game on Steam, so your Steam account (if you have one) is safe.

Total Decompressed Size: 1.33 GB
Compilation Quality: Near-Perfect (About 90% Complete)"
,Doc Lithius,2008-01-25T13:23Z,"Also, the texture for the outside world during the ending is missing...but it doesn't come up as missing.  Or something...  My suspicion is that said texture is in the Half-Life 2 or HL2: Episode 2 data files."
,MokkaCicc,2008-01-26T09:56Z,"Vista users!
I fixed the problem :D
Just go to Users\[your username]\AppData\VirtualStore!
There is the portal by Vo0 go to the folder, and copy everything in the folder (NOT THE FOLDER!)
And copy to [Choosed drive]:\Program Files\Portal by Vo0\ and copy to the folder, and download this: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3996347
Enjoy and think with portals!
:D "
,MokkaCicc,2008-01-26T12:57Z,"Sorry, not ot AppData\VirtualStore!
The good location is = C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\Portal by Vo0\ !!!
