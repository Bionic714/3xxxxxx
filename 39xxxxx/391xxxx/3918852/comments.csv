Anyhoo, I have watched this concert and it is the real deal man. It will rock your life!
Damn, that Bob was a cool fox!"
,voodochild,2007-12-04T02:24Z,Your a good man Charlie Brown. I saw this on TV yesterday it was PBS so it kept interrupting the concert with BS talk. People Bob and his music is nothing but pure love and goodness he is a good man and his spirit will live on forever. D/L this concert spark a good one and get lost in the music and soul of the sounds of Bob Marley and the Wailers.
