In this sixth season premiere, Jonas (Corin Nemec), unable to return to Kelowna 
is eager to ?finish what the missing Dr. Jackson started.? He and O?Neill 
(Richard Dean Anderson) are introduced to the X-302, the first human-built 
spacecraft capable of interstellar travel. Meanwhile, the Stargate mysteriously

Carter (Amanda Tapping) estimates that the Stargate can only withstand the 
attack for another 54 hours. Teal'c (Christopher Judge) and his son, Ryac, 
decide to seek out and destroy the weapon that has transformed the gate into 
a time bomb. Meanwhile, Jonas (Corin Nemec) saves the day by devising a plan 
to explode the Stargate seconds after O?Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) passes 
through the hyperspace window. SG-1 acquires a new Stargate from the Russians, 
trading plans for the ill-fated X-302. As a reward for helping save the planet, 
Jonas becomes a full-fledged member of SG-1.

Original air date: June 21, 2002 
Carter (Amanda Tapping) and an SG team board an apparently abandoned Gou'ald 
mothership and are ambushed. With its drive controls disabled by Anubis' evil 
plot, the ship plummets through the atmosphere and crashes into the Pacific 
Ocean. When Carter removes a matrix of crystals from the computer core, the 
self-destruct mechanism activates, giving the team 17 minutes to escape. With 
the launch systems jammed, Jonas (Corin Nemec) saves the day and the crewmembers 
are jettisoned to safety just as the mothership explodes.

Episode 04 - Frozen

Original air date: June 28, 2002 
When woman is found frozen in the ice near an Antarctic research station, the 
SG-1 team is sent to investigate. The three scientists who found the woman - 
Michaels, Osbourne and Dr. Woods - believe she is thousands of years old. Tissue 
tests show that, unlike normal human cells, which suffer irreparable damage when 
frozen, the woman's cells are perfectly intact. Aiyana, as Michaels has named 
her, is defrosted and slowly comes to life. EEG's indicate that Aiyana may be an 
example of advanced human evolution, with cells that have evolved to withstand 
sub-zero temperatures. Carter theorizes that her races may have evolved long 
modern day humans. Michael's contracts an incurable virus from Aiyana, who seems 
immune to its effects. Osbourne falls ill. Then Dr. Woods gets lost in an 
Antarctic blizzard, forcing Teal'c and O'Neill set out on a rescue mission. 
Teal'c and O'Neill find the doctor nearly frozen and haul him back to the base 
dome for treatment. As they desperately try to save his life, Aiyana steps 
forward and heals Woods with her bare hands. After curing Osbourne, Michaels 
and Carter, Aiyana collapses in exhaustion. With her immune system weakened by 
the stress of all that healing, Aiyana succumbs to the virus as well. O'Neill 
begins to show symptoms, but Aiyana dies before she can help him. Back at SGC, 
a Tok'ra named Thoran informs the team that O'Neill will die unless he accepts 
a symbiote. O'Neill is reluctant, but Carter assures him that the symbiote will 
only stay until he is cured and the Tok'ra can find a new host. When Carter 
mentions that the symbiote has important information acquired during a recent 
mission, before the untimely death of its host, O'Neill agrees to have the 
procedure.
