This is the kind of "educational" movies they used to show in American schools in the 1960s. This Sid Davis Production contains such quotes as:

"What Jimmy didn't know was that Ralph was sick; a sickness that was not visible like smallpox, but no less dangerous and contagious; a sickness of the mind. You see, Ralph was a homosexual: a person who demands an intimate relationship with members of their own sex."

And, of course:

"One never knows when a homosexual is about. He may appear normal and it may be too late when you discover he is mentally ill."

This is a ten-minute short movie made in 1961. It has since lapsed into the public domain.
