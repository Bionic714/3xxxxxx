,X-PLODE,2007-12-13T22:49Z,"UnionDance i would love to give you a link, but i can't seem to post any http links on comments without getting a Database Error  :/

So just google around for it or learn how to use mIRC or something IRC like and ask me in my channel...when i am actually in :D

Or just ask Xaoi and Haryel in the channel...they are my yaoi boys xD"

I especially appreciated your release of Bazooka Cafe, since nobody else seemed to want to put it out there.

Are you planning on releasing Snow Sakura? According to G-Collections, it's been released already, and should be shipping now. I've been looking forward to that game."
