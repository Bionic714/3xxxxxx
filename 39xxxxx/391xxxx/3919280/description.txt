Notes

1 Cohen was not directly involved in the writing of "Hope" but was given a writing credit by the band due to similarities in melody and lyrical pattern to his "Suzanne".
Â² Includes a brief piece entitled "I'm Not over You", with Stipe soloing on acoustic guitar, after the song's conclusion. The song's title and lyrics are even printed in the booklet.
