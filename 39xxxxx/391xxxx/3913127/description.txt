MISSING Only Fools and Horses.S05E09-Royal Variety Show

Brief:  This scene took place during the Royal Variety Performance Show.

Del and Rodney along with Albert arrive at Drury Lane London thinking they are delivering dodgy goods to Chunky Lewis a nightclub owner in the West End. Unfortunately they take a wrong turn and end up walking into the middle of the Royal Variety performance. They mistake the Duchess of York (Fergie) for Chunky Lewis...bear in mind she wasn\\\'t too slim in those days.

Extremely rare footage. If you got it PLEASE UPLOAD it.
