,bradfantin,2007-11-30T17:05Z,works great. now my vista partition actually is worth using now that i can have my itunes music w/o downloading it all over agian!!
,Gunnarj,2007-12-15T23:44Z,"I don't know how to use the keygen since it doesn't work just to click ""make""


What's his computer ID and where to I get it?"
,Gunnarj,2007-12-15T23:50Z,"Well, it worked when I had spent like one minute fast-clicking new serials. :D"
,younglad,2007-12-16T04:27Z,"fantastic, thanks very much!"
,RyoMasterSan,2007-12-18T22:22Z,Thanx to you :)
,simonhojland,2007-12-19T13:18Z,"Doesn't seem to work for me.

installs fine, but when i use the keygen, it tells me it has not been activated. Tryed about 10 times now. =/

Help!"
,joself82,2007-12-23T16:34Z,"Works great, did take me a min to figure out how to use the keygen. ""Make"" Generates your serial key, use that first, then when you get to the activate page (select other activation options and no internet), copy and paste your computer ID from the activation page into the keygen, then the authcode will show up, copy and paste that into the activation page. BTW, I used this on the free trial that I downloaded from their website, worked great."

Thanks man! I apreciate your help! 

FOLLOW joself82's INSTRUCTION!!!"
,Teoulas,2008-01-30T21:56Z,Note: It doesn't work with 64bit versions of Windows!
,alfdog2,2008-03-06T17:22Z,"Nice work, after installing and entering key, I was even able to upgrade to the new version 7.1 from 7.0.10"
,NickT123,2008-03-07T00:52Z,"great torrent, follow joself's instructions.  reads my mac external drives and internal partitioned hackintosh kalyway leopard 10.5.2 drive.  nice work."
,goive,2008-03-22T13:20Z,"i have the same problem as simonhojland! i do everything as usual, make a serial, enter the comp code, and then enter the reg code generated by the gen! then it says ""not activated"" as if i pressed cancel or something. is anything wrong?"
,V4oLDbOY,2008-03-24T10:45Z,"thanks works fine, I guess all of the keys are linked somehow so you gave to do it in a certain order. 

First open activate mac drive. Then open keygen. Copy the key into mac drive and hit show other options, than I have no internet connection. Copy the computer id into the keygen, dont hit make. Every new key, macdrive makes a new computer id. Than copy the authentication # fromm the keygeb into macdrive and it should work. It took me a few tries before I realized not to hit make, which I kept doing."
,goive,2008-03-30T10:32Z,"MacDrive seems to have a life of its own and *deregisters* itself whenever it feels like it. That means I have to activate it whenever I need it. No problem, just seems a little weird especially when no-one else has to... Does anyone have any suggestions?"
,malkeh,2008-04-08T20:17Z,"great works well

Gunnarj: activate by phone, not by internet."
,blazesboylan,2008-04-14T03:04Z,"Works wonderfully.  Now would one of you clever people come up with a crack for xplay3?  It's much improved over earlier versions, but requires activation."
,gzinga,2008-06-06T18:46Z,"for 7.1.0 to work you first have to install this 7.0.10
Then activate it with the provided keygen
then go to their website and download the trial version of 7.1.0. now install it (remember: you don't have to restart after installing the first one). it even tells you, that it will only update.

now you have a fully registered 7.1.0 (why do this? the keygen doesnt work for the new version)"
,Wayfarer247,2008-06-08T18:02Z,Worked perfectly!  Followed the instructions by V4oLDbOY.  Then updated to the newest release. Thank you guys!
,nicotfeine,2008-06-17T18:16Z,"can i use (read-write) my ntfs external hard drive in mac with this program.

or think in hard way

can i install it to my pc and read-write hsf+ format."
,karltech,2008-06-17T18:19Z,"Thanks, works like a charm. "
,bigdane545,2008-06-20T22:33Z,Ah lovely.. Thanks freddie..I now i can use my TB directly with my 360!  The damn 360 only recognizes Fat32 or HFS+.  The downside with Fat32 is it cannot recognize any individual files over 4 gigs which suck for HD movies.  With this handy utility you can create a HFS partition for the 360 to recognize.. WOO.. Thanks again

[T],g-roid,2009-03-14T07:00Z,Thanks for this!
[T],g-roid,2009-03-14T07:20Z,"If you install this with the keygen, you can then download the latest version (7.2.6) from their website and install it. It updates this version perfectly. Great crack!"
,Wiiaddict,2009-04-19T22:40Z,"i think im doing it wrong, like, i tried a buncha stuff, but, when it asks for the serial, you put in a keygened key, and then do the other options option (lol repetition) and select other comp internet access, but then do you copy in the computer ID that the macdrive activate thing gave you  into the keygen to get an activation key? and after that you would copy the activation key into macdrive and then it works... i think i skipped over or input the wrong thing into it, or accidentally used the browser... hmmm ima try again..."
,scrapetorrent,2009-06-04T17:50Z,"Erm, this is not a mac app."
,pompor,2009-07-21T15:18Z,greate thx
,jdubose3,2009-12-07T14:26Z,Just tried it in Win 7 and error message says its only good for Vista and XP :(
,Beepboxx,2010-06-21T14:03Z,"Nice keygen! This is a Windows app, lets windows read mac drives and files.
Use this version, the later versions don't work with the keygen. No need for online registration, use no internet option.
Thanx"
,mava96,2011-01-30T15:30Z,THE KEY GENERATOR DOESNT WORK ...
,morpheusxnyc,2011-10-12T18:06Z,"@Jdubose3 - Yeah, I doubt this is Windows 7 compatible since this torrent was uploaded in 2007, but Windows 7 wasn't released until 2009.

But who knows? "
