,Puny Human,2007-12-01T14:49Z,"Thanks 

You're uploading some good stuff and I appreciate it. 

Sound is about telephone or AM radio quality.  Which is just fine by me for spoken word recordings. "
,SisterBertrille,2008-05-17T04:38Z,I personally thought the narrator was a poor choice. 
,bigsanfrey,2008-07-15T11:30Z,"This book is excellent!
I had to read this at school, and listened to it on the way to the bus stop and home etc..

Thanks a lot!!"
,Saadi,2008-09-18T15:03Z,"Its better if you read it...

Cuz the Sound Quality is awful"
,alroso,2008-09-21T11:41Z,danke sehr!
,AScottToney,2009-01-06T20:23Z,"Thanks for uploading. Sounds quality is not ""great"" but it's not distracting. I found the narrator to be fitting."
,selphie19,2009-01-29T05:20Z,"hey thanks so much i read this book before back in high school and i want to read it again but it's late, im too lazy to buy it or go to the library and i can multitask too... painting and listening to this audio book! thanks man"
,falcott,2009-02-28T09:01Z,"This book has no redeeming qualities - quite frankly it is the worse book that I have ever read, and they force fed it to me at high school. Ugh..."
,stands2reason,2009-06-11T00:16Z,Are you just trying to show off by uploading all this smart stuff? ;-)
,dcrystalj,2009-08-26T00:08Z,not good enough quality
,Supermariomad,2010-03-05T10:46Z,"Thanks, never got round to reading this before."
,movielover420,2010-03-15T14:33Z,can someone please upload the guardians of ga'hoole audiobook series i would really appreciate it
,ColbyCannon,2010-07-07T01:24Z,"I can't believe that anyone actually liked this book.  Seriously, I read it at 30 and the main character is a spoiled kid who blames everyone else for his positions in life - which is shit.  I barely made it to the end.  There is so many better books out there."
,Bass-tingle,2010-10-09T10:55Z,I just wanna know why this book was supposed to be the reason for Lennon's death.
,saggit,2010-11-28T21:48Z,A really CRAPPY audio quality =(
,torrentdemonoid,2010-12-04T08:02Z,"For those bashing the book, y'all obviously don't understand the context of it with regard to the time period in which it was written. I don't know how old you are or where you're from, but this book was way ahead of its time if you do indeed understand its context."
,Joshua173,2011-03-04T15:13Z,i made a copy of thees fils except the chapters are split up it makes it easier to use if you want it for school. thees files were made out of by dividing the files in this torrent. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6217000/J.D._Salinger_-_The_Catcher_In_The_Rye_(1999)_split_up_chapters_
,blablukar,2011-05-11T20:30Z,"could you please upload
