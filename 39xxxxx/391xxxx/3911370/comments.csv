Please anyone who watches this to get a grasp of what chiro is... ignore it completely.  This video represents a SMALL group of chiro's known as straight chiropractors.  Those of us who DO take blood pressure, and other vitals are interested in diagnosing correctly, and then treating the underlying problem.  Not just treating the entire spine without any regard to what is actually wrong.  Anyway... if anything, please keep in mind that this video is very very dated."
