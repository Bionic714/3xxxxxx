,Ultimate-Z,2010-04-04T06:37Z,"OMG You are truely a Genius brother.  I wanna thank you sooo sooooo much for these 100% perfecr DVD Rips.  I wanted to ask if you could do this for Batman: The Animated Series as well.  Ive already downloaded your Justice League Unlimited Episodes.  Man I really dont know what to say.  You are such a master a encoding dvd rips so perfect and down to the mila second.  Thats exzactly how everyone loves them.

I have already found 100% excellent dvd rips of

The New Batman Adventures (1997 - 1999, continuation of Batman: The Animated Series)

But I have not got DVD Rips of Batman the animated series.  Everytime I download a torrent it claims to be DVD Rips, but then its not it misses the opening theme.  But your episodes are soo sooo dang perfect like there is nothing better.  I was wondering if possible if you could do the same kind of DVD rips but for batman the animated series or 

The New Batman Adventures (1997 - 1999, continuation of Batman: The Animated Series)

please do more batmans/supermans.  I already have superman the animated series also in dvd rips.  I just need the batman/superman adventures or can you do batman the animated series.  Thanks."
