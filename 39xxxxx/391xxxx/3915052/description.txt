These are my rips of Batman Beyond, which I created using the original DVDs as the source for these rips. These are ripped that same way my JLU rips were done, so I am pleased with them.

I have made 3 volumes that all fit on a DVD for ease of upload and storage. A fourth upload will include my rip of Return of the Joker, when I can get a copy (i.e. hopefully soon). I will upload each one at a time until I have seeders and then move to the next one.

This is Volume 1 of 3

Note: It will take at least 2-3 days for me to finish to the first seed. Just bear with me please.
