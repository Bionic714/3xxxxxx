,ninseed,2007-11-29T01:25Z,"Jdemon, do you do anything but bitch about speed?"
,skyseason,2007-11-30T13:11Z,"it's disgusting how many people downloaded this but stopped seeding. it'll be the death of torrents (on public trackers, anyway). most people didn't even stay around until they hit a 1."
,OzBrickie,2008-02-08T22:16Z,"Unfortunately, there are people, such as myself in Oz, who pay an outrageous fee to the ISP just to get 12 Gb. Personally, I seed as much as I can, all be it very slowly, until I hit my limit then I'm down to fucken dial-up speeds. Now once this happens, usually in the first week, what do you friggen whingers reckon we are going to do? I am not saying everyone is like that but spare a thought for those of us who do the best we can . OK?"
