,slintrebor,2008-01-13T21:20Z,"Thanks! I understand that there is a ""summer version"" of this (vertical jigging) film. You would't happen to have that one too?"
,Szed,2008-03-31T10:29Z,"Nice speed. I'll help upload, if you help me with one thing.. 
I'm kind of not very good with computers and if I download a file with Âľtorrent, and then want to move it to another folder. How should I do to upload the file from there? When I move it it says the file cannot be found.

Thanks for the upload speed:)"
