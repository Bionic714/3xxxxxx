THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. 124 "The Hong Kong Shilling Affair"

Solo is aided by tourist Bernie Oren (Glenn Corbett) in finding a black market auction in Hong Kong run by Mr. Cleveland (Gavin McLeod) that sells military secrets, including a microfilm in a rare coin. Oren is infatuated with Heavenly Cortello (Karen Sharpe), and hinders more than he helps Solo, while Illya tries to infiltrate the auction disguised as a Mongolian warlord. Corbett actually injured himself during fall shown in Act IV. That's why his character lays on the ground, off camera, for rest of sequence. Gavin MacLeod appears as a villain and Richard Kiel is a thug who gives NS the business.
