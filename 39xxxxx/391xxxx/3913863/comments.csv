Thanks for the up aladin4u"
,punk92,2008-04-26T16:58Z,thx man ive been lookin for the full album for weeks 
,jinxxdk,2009-03-28T02:37Z,By far the best Linkin Park album out there imo. Whether or not you usually like remixes I'd encourage you to check this out and go buy it when you realize how amazing it is.
,busic31,2009-06-12T04:25Z,thanks! good!
,KkokiI,2009-07-08T02:40Z,Thanks!
,KkokiI,2009-07-09T13:03Z,"Ok after listening to it, the songs are skipping and only play halfway through. That's fucked up."
,stimsnaps,2010-08-13T20:30Z,Dont waste your time. The songs dont play all the way through. 
,DaN00berz,2010-11-20T08:54Z,"jeez u got all the spellings wrong.. anyway, nobody (apart from me) cares.. lol. THANKS ANYWAY.. GREAT JOB evil aladin4u!!"
,s_4170_va,2010-12-01T19:02Z,Thanks Bro...
,GreenLiz,2011-01-04T21:43Z,"yeah i i say so to the spelling is weird, but it's a good torrent thanks dude"
,MegaSnowCloud01,2011-01-21T03:35Z,"Of course the spellings are weird. That's how they're spelled on the actual album. After all, it's a REMIX. It's much better than just putting (Remix) on the end of every song."
,heyman123,2011-06-01T05:03Z,"It's probably skipping because your computer or speakers suck. 
It's SUPER HIGH QUALITY 320KBPS!!!!!
But yea..."
,nick1ss1gndon,2011-08-30T02:56Z,"@megasnowcloud01 The names are spelled completely wrong with regards to the album version.  If you absolutely need your song names correct, don't bother with this torrent.  "
,78Mayam81,2012-07-12T03:23Z,"People who think all remixes are fucking gay are homosexual cum dumpsters who can't leave a party until every fag there has run the train on em TWICE!  (see what i did there? sweeping generalizations are FUN aren't they?)  Seriously, this album is at the very high end of the ""FUCKIN' AMAZIN"" scale and is worth a listen for ANY Linkin Park fan.  Many thanks aladin - very appreciated"
