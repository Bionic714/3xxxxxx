,yojacoby,2008-08-23T19:47Z,"This is one of my favorite mixes so far! The original version of ""no more I love you's"" is awesome! Picnic at the Whitehouse is way better than Panic at the Disco! The song ""Holiday in Bangkok"" is f'ing hilarious and not at all like ""one Night in Bangkok""  (sarcasm). 

I really like the style of Images in Vogue, he's got a great vocal style...I would love to hear an entire album by hthose guys if ya have it?

Thanks again for all this great musak!"
