,miaerowyn,2007-12-11T07:03Z,"Hi, I'm new to this stuff, so I was wondering if anyone could help me out with setting this up... I've installed it, but when I try to play, it's says:
Conflict with Emulation Software detected.
Please have a look at http://www.securom.com/message.asp?m=emu&c=2500 for further, more detailed info. 

I clicked on it, and there wasn't really any ""detailed"" info... lol!! 
Please help :D"
