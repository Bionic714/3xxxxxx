Bucketheadland Blueprints is the demo version of Buckethead's first album Bucketheadland.

Bucketheadland Blueprints features many early versions of the riffs featured on Bucketheadland as well as riffs which were not used at all. Notably the "park theme" is different to the one used in the album version, though the album version of the park theme can be heard on this demo tape.

In August 2007, this album was reissued on the TDRS Music label. It is available in a limited edition version, personalized by Buckethead, and a regular edition, which is not personalized, but has complete artwork, which the limited edition versions lacks.
