,The Hawk,2008-01-08T05:13Z,Does anyone know if this is any good?  I know Ghost 12 is shit.  Full drive backups will not work on XP and Vista will blue screen.  Symantec refuses to fix the problem.

Ghost 14 is fully vista compatable and I'm using it on XP now. Not working with my 2K though so I'm trying to find 11."
