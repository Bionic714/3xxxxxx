Berklee DVD -- A Modern Method for Guitar Volume 1
  Imaged with PowerISO
  Packed with WinRAR
  

This is the instructional video used by the Berklee School of Music for their guitar course.  In this video you will find many hours of lessons tailored to the serious learner.  There are 14 hours of lessons on this DVD.  While it is intended for use with the Berklee text book "A Modern Method for Guitar -- Volume 1" it works well as a stand-alone educational DVD.

The downside is this DVD will not work in your regular DVD player.  You have to watch it on your computer because it uses its own macromedia / quicktime player.  The plus to this is you won't have to worry about DVD software for your PC or Mac.


Instructions:
1. Unpack with WinRAR
2. Mount or burn the ISO file with PowerISO or whatever you prefer
3. Learn and Enjoy
4. Rock on.


Currently, there is no volume 2 on DVD
