,Perpetual,2008-01-12T18:20Z,Is this lesson with tabs!
,Ganellon,2008-01-21T22:02Z,"No, there are no tabs. This video will teach you how to actually read music as well as play it, so that you'll never have to rely on tabs again. (Not that tabs are a bad thing -- they certainly have their place and are very convenient when trying to learn a piece for which standard notation is unavailable.)"

Love how they called it ""Volume 1"".  Haha"
