,Witott,2007-12-09T11:29Z,so i downloaded it but the files were in SFV-format... How do i change it to ISO.files??
,billiewinkle,2007-12-12T09:15Z,I used HJSplit to bring the archive together but did not get an iso What do I do now?
,billiewinkle,2007-12-12T09:19Z,Ahh crude Their Website is a scam..Maybe the torrent is just random trash Hold off downloading until some confirmation comes back
,billiewinkle,2007-12-12T14:37Z,This bites torrent requires u to winwar all numbered files to get an iso. iso 1 loaded fine but iso 2 would not load regardless of how I tried it. Totally scewed my current game and now i have find the disk and reload the original and recrack. I am unhappy
,bonkery,2007-12-13T02:00Z,"Ok, sorted the game 7+ gigs, worked well till 30 hrs into the game, you can imagine the feeling of utter frustration at the break down, cant play it further, this expansion though does not work, it wants you to go on-line, which is a no go, the 2 together seemed a dream to good."
,rafoody,2008-01-07T17:31Z,"Guys yu dont hav to make the files an ISO file , but yu must have (WINRAR) , if yu hav it , just click the first file of medieval 2 : DVD1/flt-twk1.001 , after that just extract the file inside it , and mount with yur Daemon tools or burn it with Nero 8 ."
,limers,2008-02-16T11:30Z,How do you get it installed i dont get it
,limers,2008-02-16T13:20Z,wer do i find the crack???
,Viking5,2008-03-11T10:18Z,"Yesterday I downloaded another version of the game but when I wanted to start it it said that this version of Kingdoms is not compatible to my german version 
is this the german version or a version that is compatible to it? 
thx "
,Valherua,2008-03-17T09:31Z,"youll have to double click it if you have winrar but it doesnt show the bookpakage 
if you do that you can choose between searching on the internet or select a program just selected the program and then winrar it should be able to show an iso file "
,Kigre,2008-03-25T05:18Z,"Can anyone confirm if this works properly?

And where else can i look for Kingdoms??



Exept the stores...

,Lordsiriuz,2008-03-25T11:08Z,"I got it installed and everything but when im about to play it, it says i need to insert the correct CD, i tried to mount both iso:s with daemon, but it still doesnt work"
,Zupermonzter,2008-04-17T19:11Z,"All you need to make it work is DEAMON TOOLS or ALOCHOL 120% to mount/burn it with   And a NO-CD crack, and if u wanna play net a valid keygen

,damieen,2008-05-02T12:57Z,"Cannot run this thing, just keep asking for disk, when i try to load just MTWII without expansion its shows error,( i have used all the cracks!).......what to do???"
,mustangboy101,2008-05-19T00:36Z,does this work?
,mustangboy101,2008-05-19T23:16Z,"Download, WinRAR. and extract the FLW-tw1 file 001. and winrar automatically extracts the files to one ISO. File. Once thats finished, open the ISO file where you extracted it and then Mount the ISO file using Deamon tools or your whatever you use. and then install the game. 
Once the game is installed go to dvd2 and explore it in My computer. click on Fairlight and place the File in your Dictionary file where you'll replace the KINGDOMS. for the cracked version. I hope this was a little help"
,sweSUCKS,2008-06-12T19:12Z,Umm why dont u reveal what version it is so we can get a right patch for it?? btw mods work with this right? i have the original game tho :P 
,sweSUCKS,2008-06-14T12:05Z,The files ain't packed. They are already unpacked and everything I try to do with ur precious winrar it just wants to PACK them. I cant mount them. I cant do shit. And im no newbie. These files are supposed to be packed. Im supposed to unpack them into a iso file. but this is just upside down and retarted.  dont give advices if u havent seen the case so shut ur mouth until ur download is complete. THEN give your advice to us thank you. Not working at the moment.
,sweSUCKS,2008-06-14T12:54Z,I cant extract shit. It doesnt even regz the filetype because IT DOESNT EVEN HAVE ONE.  Nice torrent. Yah nice. I let my friend take a look at this hes a real geek. If it doesnt work the same friend will ip track u and I'll come and pay a visit :))))))

,BeautifulDisease,2008-06-16T21:52Z,"When I installed the game with DVD 2 it said ""data error crc - cyclic redundancy check"" and now only three of the four campaigns are installed. :S"
,Zhander,2008-07-05T23:24Z,"In DVD1 I have extracted the flt-twk1 file, and got a bunch of other files, i tried to install the game by using daemond tools, but in the middle of the instalation it says that unitdriver of something did not make the dll. instalation. And after that it aborts :(
Help?"
,Zhander,2008-07-06T22:28Z,"Ok..forget the last comment..
I downloaded all of the patches and the errors were removed. But now a new error have appeared (of course). When I try to install it, by using the setup.exe file, I get get a CRC error: The file (*filename) doesn't match the file in the setup's .cap file.
Anybody who knows why this happens, and how to fix it?"
,Ascarona,2008-08-24T22:16Z,"I installed everything and cracked it as well, however the kingdoms crack doesnt work, its not asking for a cd. Its just a blank error message. I can use the expansions apart but its annoying!!"

,ismellfunny67,2010-03-20T19:06Z,"For all of you having problems installing this... First off, you should have winrar, winzip, and something like daemontools. You right click the first sfv file in each disk, go down to ""open with"" and use winrar. Then extract to whatever folder you prefer and you will have the full iso. Next mount the iso image using daemon tools and autorun should do the rest. Once its installed copy the crack from disk 2 and youre done."
,ismellfunny67,2010-03-20T19:07Z,"On a sidenote, the game wont launch for me from the ""kingdoms"" launcher, but i can play each individual campaign by launching from the start menu. Cheers."

,Deruve,2011-01-02T17:50Z,"only way to make it work was through the launcher. might help all of you who get a bunch of errors. (i dont have any shortcuts to each mod, might work with those as well.)"
,smk_buddy,2011-07-13T02:51Z,lol swesucks is a newb and so is his friend disregard his 3 comments it works fine
,xShadowsHunter,2011-10-17T06:37Z,this does not work for me because it does not give the option to open with and when i try opening with winrar it says it may be an unknown format or damaged file please help no trolls 
,peter7789,2012-04-18T15:32Z,"Ok guys i managed to install it without problems, i just did this.. I just went do DVD1 and right clicked flt-twk1.001, opened with Winrar and then the actual ISO file appeared, i dragged (extract) the ISO to my desktop and opened Daemon tools. Then all you have to do is right click on daemon tools, virtual drive, mount image, go to your desktop or wherever you extracted the ISO and mount it, click the launcher and it will install. Takes a lot of time to install but works. There will be a time when it will ask you for CD2 and then all you have to do is go to the DVD2, right click on flt-twk2( which is the 001 on this folder) and open with Winrar aswell, than drag to desktop like you did with the dvd1 ISO and mount it with daemon tools. It will completely install without any problems(at least for me), it will install the game plus some patches and mods without any problems. After the installation you just have to open the 2nd CD again and go to Fairlight folder and copy the crack to the game directory on your computer (program files x86 SEGA Medieval II Total War) and there you go...
Worked fine for me and hope this will help"

,MitchAllen,2012-08-17T03:08Z,Ok second time i tried and the EXACT same error. I install (man that takes awhile) all of them :P and then i use the crack and try to play. It loads the opening screen then crashes. Then a Blank error box comes up :( so i cant figure out how to fix it. 
,MitchAllen,2012-08-17T05:23Z,the kingdom.exe didnt work but the icons on the desktop launches it. Thanks for the upload.
