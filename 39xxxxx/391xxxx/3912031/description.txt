Colma (album)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Colma is Buckethead's fourth album, released March 24, 1998, by CyberOctave records. The album was recorded for Buckethead's mother as she was ill and he wanted to make an album she would enjoy listening to whilst recovering. [1].

The title of the album makes reference to the small town of Colma near San Francisco, California, where "the dead population outnumber the living by thousands to one".
