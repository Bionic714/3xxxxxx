Buckethead released 2 new songs on December 28th 2008 in honor of JAMES LEBRON, one of his favorite basketballplayers, who has his birthday on that day. The songs are called ""Lebron"" and ""Lebron's Hammer""

You can download them directly and legally from BH's offcial website Bucketheadland.com. Here is the direct link:

As a bonus Buckethead also included a free download of his song ""King James"" from the 2008 album ""Crime Slunk Scene"".

Check 'em out, pretty cool stuff!
Happy headcheese everyone! :) "
