The Photoshop Camera Raw plug-in became the latest must-have tool for professional photographers when it was released in February 2003. This powerful plug-in has been updated to support more cameras and include more features, and is available as part of Adobe Photoshop CS3. Adobe Photoshop Lightroom is also available and is built upon the same powerful raw processing technology that is available in the camera raw plug-in.
