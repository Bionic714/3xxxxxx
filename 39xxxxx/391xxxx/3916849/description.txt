Live-Secret Samahdi 1997             This is My Favorite CD By Live Ripped with dbpower amp 320 kbs constant bit rate........................Musically is where this album shines. "Lakini's Juice" drives harder than any song on TC; likewise "Turn My Head" -- a GORGEOUS, HAUNTING song (note the capitals are there for a reason) that will stand the test of time -- makes the album worth owning by its lone self. Rattlesnake is a hard-edged opener that starts the album off with a bang, while Ghost provides some beautiful textures and female vocals that come as a great change of pace. Really, virtually every song on here is a winner, but they are also songs that won't immediately grab you like TC's did -- ya' gotta give this album time to find a way to your soul
