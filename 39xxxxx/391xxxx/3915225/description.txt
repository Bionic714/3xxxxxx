   Release Notes:

   In recording "Nothing Fancy", Jessie was clearly focused on
   her gut instinct when it came to capturing these new songs.
   The result is a wonderful collection of joyful country -pop
   that is often attempted, but rarely successfully attained; a
   Dixie Chicks, Shania Twain, Alison Kraus-esque magic that a
   wide variety of ages and audiences are drawn into. Mix that
   cross-genre appeal with Jessie's chemistry and magnetism and
   you have a force to be reckoned with.
