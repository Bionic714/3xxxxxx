,CiTiBoY,2008-02-04T03:05Z,"Well, I have to say I appreciate the effort put into FXG's work but when I burn em to cd they are so grainy on the home player I can't watch em without running the thru WINavi converter. I emailed FXG but never got a reply, any ideas anyone? By the way, leetay's posts play well!"
,likeathiefinthenight,2008-03-20T04:31Z,I have no problems with FXG's quality of movies.  I plug my laptop into my 50 inch plasma and they still look fairly good.  Not HD or anything but still pretty good.
