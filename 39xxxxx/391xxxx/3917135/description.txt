Synopsis
The suave, psychedelic era thief called Diabolik (John Philip Law) can┬┤t get enough of life┬┤s good or glittery things. Not when there are currency shipments to steal from under the noses of snooty government officials and priceless jewels to lift from the boudoirs of the superrich. The elusive scoundrel finds plenty of ways to live up to his name in this tongue in cheek, live action caper inspired by Europe┬┤s popular Diabolik comics. He clambers up walls, zaps a press conference with Exhilaration Gas, smacks a confession out of a crimelord while freefalling with him from an airplane, and pulls off the heist of a twenty ton gold ingot. Impossible? No, diabolical Danger: Diabolik, to be exact!..
