Plot Outline: A strange cloud descends upon Klingon vessels and eradicates them with an energy bolt. The Epsilon IX space station alerts the Federation, but they too are wiped out by the entity. The starship assigned to the case is, what else, the NCC-1701. That would be the registration number for the U.S.S. Enterprise, which has been rebuilt. Thus, the entire original crew you knew from the TV show returns. Although they are prepared to face the entity, nothing will prepare them for the ride to come. The film asks the question Paul Gauguin asks in a painting bearing this name: \"Where do [I] come from? What [am I]? Where [am I] going?\" Trekkers, note the appearance of Will Decker, the son of Matt Decker, who killed himself in the TV episode, \"The Doomsday Machine\". The film can be summed up in a single word: beautiful.
