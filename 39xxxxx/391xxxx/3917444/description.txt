Ok, here's everything I have on the Hydra Entertainment label, home to hip hop beat-smiths like Godfather Don, The Beatnuts, and Prince Po of Organized Konfusion.  I don't have all of the "Hydra Beats" series but I have Volumes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12 and "Next Level 1" by Godfather Don.  Also included are 5 rare 12 inches, Don's 1998 LP "Diabolique", the 2004 Screwball double-LP "Screwed Up", and the Hostyle (of Screwball) LP "One Eyed Maniac".
