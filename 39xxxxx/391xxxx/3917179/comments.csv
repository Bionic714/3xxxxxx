,EmesiS,2007-12-03T02:51Z,"Excellent!! Thanx for the share. Australian Simulation finally got things right. The guage lights are actually individually lit instead of the whole dash lighting up. And the aircraft shows damage when crashed, wings coming off with pieces and fire. Something that MS always fails to do. The Warrior II was he first real small plane that I ever took the controls in so this is a great addition. I'll be looking foward to more from this company...thanx again. 
Oh wait I forgot to say ""SEED"" and to request something like everyone else does!

REQ: Quit requesting shit and try uploading something, you bleeding cunts! LOL.... "
