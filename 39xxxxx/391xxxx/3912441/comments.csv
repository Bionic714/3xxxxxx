,lamppost,2007-11-30T07:41Z,Damn - this is sweet. I actually met the developer at MacWorld Expo last year and bought a copy.
,xxxpawnxxx,2007-12-03T04:25Z,Serial doesn't work.  Either that or I don't know which Name/Organization to put.
,maracan,2007-12-05T05:05Z,"Works perfect.  Just don't try it on a new download.  Use the dmg file included in this torrent.  Thanks, Korolok!"

,CrankyBird,2008-05-16T06:04Z,"Hi,
Will this work properly on a MacBook Pro, inte,l running OS 10.5.2?

I downloaded a similar one 

xSkyjDesk v1.3.6  _ Sky Simulator for the Desktop 

and my processor went crazy. It got hot, so fast, it burned my legs. Worse I couldn't find a way to stop it, using the program.

I finally used Clean App to get rid of it.

So...I want to be sure that this will not act the same way. Does anyone have any experience running this on a system like mine?

Thanks,
Kunga"
,xushi,2008-05-20T10:32Z,works perfectly on my 10.5.2 with no problems. Be aware that the newer 4.2 version wont work with this CD Key. But a simple reinstallation of 4.1 will work again and no need to enter the key again.
,pwn247,2008-08-17T22:48Z,"Working perfectly on my Intel Mac Pro system. No problems here!

Just download the ZIP file, open it up, run the DMG file, let it install. Once installed, open it up in System Preferences and hit 'License'. Simply enter any name (the ""company"" box can be left empty), and paste the serial (included in a text file). 

:D"
