i placed the first part of this episode on Demonoid a few weeks ago (approx 28 min long).
this part looks at \'out of body\' experiences and night mares\'. it also now tracked by sumotracker.

this is the second half of the first episode, which as i found out later are approx. 50 minutes long.
this is a vhs rip of a tv show aired in approx. 2000. sorry i cut most of the credits when i recorded it,
hence i don\'t have much more info on it. if anyone has more info, please share.

this part looks at \'dream telepathy\'.
