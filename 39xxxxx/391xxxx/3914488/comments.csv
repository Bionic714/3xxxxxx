,Dopeman,2007-11-30T15:21Z,"Would not count on this working, read carefully the description it includes:

""We  are  not entirely sure if this works or not. So far we weren't
      rejected  but  neither  were  we able to successfully join a game.
      It  may  just  be a buggy start so keep an eye on it, it may work.""

lol"
,luuke,2007-11-30T15:35Z,"the game dont even install for me..  when it says ""installing from disc"" i get  an Steam - Error The servers are currelnty  to busy too handle your reqest. please try again in a few minutes.  and when you try to start the game u get the ""LIBEAY32.dll"" error because THE IS NOT EVEN INSTALLED  the file dont not exist.. no wonder.. "
,luuke,2007-11-30T15:44Z,this sux. this clearly shows how desperate they are to get there release out first .. they dont even care if the game works or not..  trash this crap and wait for a working release from a proper team 
,luuke,2007-11-30T15:52Z,"yeah sry .. a bit to harsh maybe.. you cant really complain sice its free,  im just alittle pissed .. cos i whas really looking forward to playing this >.< looks awsome.. "
