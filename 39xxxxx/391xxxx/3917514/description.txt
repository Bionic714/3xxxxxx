
The weather is heating up and we're almost into summer. Grab a
coldie and cool down with our Victorian High Country DVD
feature. Join Roothy and the Piranha Off Road team as they
tackle some of the toughest High Country tracks around.

To make things interesting, Roothy left Milo at home to punish
the new H3 Hummer and see if this Yank tank has what it takes
to battle in the Aussie bush.

See three awesome custom trucks with Mark Allen - a tidy Rodeo
with an amazing camper set-up on the back, a tough 80 Series
tourer and a decommissioned Mercedes-Benz Unimog that has been
given a new lease on life.

Join editor Glenn as he lets you in on some workshop hints and
tricks that will see you spinning spanners around like a pro in
no time. Learn how to use a high-lift jack safely and
effectively, and get the lowdown on bullbars.

Then, Glenn shows you how to buy the best Toyota 100 Series
'Cruiser for your money and Roothy cooks up a storm. All this
on the only DVD that's better value than a 1978 LandCruiser -
and cheaper to run too!
