This is freakin' tremendous stuff. I love Daft Punk - and I loved their Discovery album. This is basically an animated manga film to the Discovery album - and if you think this sounds crazy - well it doesn't as everything makes sense! If you are a Daft Punk fan - then you probably saw the first three or four video clips for the singles on TV (One More Time, Aerodynamic, Digital Love and Harder Better Faster Stronger) - and it tells a short story of a rock and roll band from outer space get kidnapped by some evil looking guys and get taken to Earth. But all hope isn't lost - as a funky guy in a Guitar rocket ship attempts a rescue mission. There isn't any dialogue - it is all cartoon with a Daft Punk soundtrack! The story tends to fit the mood of the music (of course!) and this really does have an intriguing story of mystery and music. All of the characters and artwork is very stylish in a 1970's-1980's Japanese cartoon sort of way (reminds me of Voltron!). So if you are a Daft Punk fan, a anime / manga fan - or just a fan of things different or cool - then get a copy of this today!
