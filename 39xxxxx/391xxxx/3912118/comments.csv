[T],FiNsTeRc,2007-11-28T03:09Z,Apparently my website has become a threat to TPB so the URL is now filtered from both comments and descriptions. So for screenshots for this torrent you will have to type it into your browser manually PIRATEFILES.0RG I didn't think I was that much competition.

,DeltaPan,2007-11-29T13:18Z,"I watched this last night.

I found it slow moving rubbish that gave a bout of ADD trying to stay with it, just couldn't get into it at all.

If this goes into general release i may give it another go but TBH i think this is one destined for the dustbin, tries to ride the films and fails, dismally.

Utter detritus IMO and that's for sure.

I mean, Yuch!

Somehow i think this show will never make it to completing a season before it's pulled off air because of failing viewer figures, if it makes it that far."
