Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell
2007 Hallowe'en Show, 31 Oct 07.
Running time: 164 minutes, 03 seconds
Format: mp3, exported from Audacity 
Recorded in glorious MONO from a crappy AM radio.  Sorry about the whine in the background.  I have no idea how to filter that out despite messing with it forever with Goldwave.  It goes away later.

Notes:
This show is called "Ghost to Ghost AM" on Hallowe'en night because the host turns it over to callers with ghost stories.

Commercials, station IDs cut.  Everything else is exactly as it was broadcast.

Share and enjoy.
