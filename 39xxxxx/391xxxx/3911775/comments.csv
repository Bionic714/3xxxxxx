,pressbush,2007-11-27T22:07Z,thanks a lot i`ve allways been infamously amazed by keroac`s books read many times in danish but i`ll take the chance and listen english
,infamousamazing,2007-11-28T00:06Z,"I hope you enjoy it :)

I am surprised that you found this torrent; each time I search for 'The Dharma Bums' (to see if the upload worked) there are no results.  If anyone reads this and knows how to fix this please let me know--a torrent is no good if it can't be found."
,paod82,2007-11-28T22:36Z,thank you very much i love this book
,infamousamazing,2007-11-29T05:30Z,"I'm going inpatient rehab tomorrow morning for at least the next 30 days so my computer will be off (not able to seed).  I hope these files have spread enough by now so that I am not the only source; if not, I am sorry and I will be back and seeding in about 30 days -- I HOPE  :-/"
