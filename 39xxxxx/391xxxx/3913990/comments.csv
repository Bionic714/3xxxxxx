Slightly Stoopid is an American band based in Ocean Beach, California,
who describe their music as ""a fusion of acoustic rock and blues with
reggae, hip-hop, and punk"". As a band, they have released seven albums
(2 live) with their fifth studio album, entitled ""Chronchitis"",
released on August 7, 2007, not counting other bootleg albums created
by dedicated fans. The band was originally signed by Bradley
Nowell from the band Sublime to his label Skunk Records. Sublime was
obviously a great influence to the band, along with roots reggae bands
from Jamaica such as the Melodians, The Upsetters, Sugar Minott, and
Junior Murvin, just to name a few. Other non-reggae influences are Dr.
Dre, Sublime, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Police, & Miles Davis, along
with other genres such as rock, reggae, blues, roots, hip hop, metal,
dub, and punk.

,cenotaphium,2008-03-27T13:49Z,Great stuff!
,c0mplex,2008-04-04T18:54Z,This is awesome thanks
,LithGeezy,2008-04-08T14:33Z,"not to sound like a dick, or anything. But (aside from this torrent, this torrent is SICK!) That Slightly Stoopid link buddy gives you... In MY opinion, 3/4 of their songs sound kinda fruity... I LOVE Sublime, I can see a resemblance, but I checked out the first 45 secs of each of those songs, and only 3 or 4 were completely playable without stabbing yourself in your cerebellum"
,LithGeezy,2008-04-08T14:33Z,"so.. maybe check out OTHER songs of theirs that aren't on that ""best of"" ... but hey, opinions vary... This is a ridiculously awesome torrent Stonedbg. Fuckin' solid!"
,heywatsup99,2008-04-10T07:35Z,"Yea Sublime is the fucking shit. RIP Bradley, I am drinking a corona in your memory right now. thanks for the awesome torrent. you ROCK"

,jsherman256,2008-05-11T23:25Z,"this torrent is not worth it... it has SO MANY duplicates of songs, crappy live versions of songs, and the highest bit rate is about 190 kbps... at least one album is good, but not worth downloading 1.7 gigs"
,marvinated,2008-05-31T22:49Z,"this is awesome

,mvernon,2008-06-05T02:55Z,"not RAR'ed, not FLAC, not fucked.  You get my vote! Who voted -1 for this torrent?

,shoesclown,2008-06-13T20:18Z,"Thanks for the upload!  Overall a good compilation, but some of the tracks aren't Sublime.  One that immediately comes to mind is Romeo from Second Hand Smoke... it's some sort of middle-eastern sounding electronic track...  "

-Karlsbad"
,nekid,2008-10-12T12:21Z,"If anyone has ""Sublime live at the Trestle"", I would be more than ultimately happy to get a copy of both CD's.
It was a VERY limited, numbered run of 2 CD sets, gold in color, and some idiot stole 1 a long time ago. (I've since lost the other)

Thank you"
,Wundermutt,2008-10-20T02:55Z,You know the world is about to end when Lil Wayne's torrent is ahead of Sublime's torrent.  Rap sucks.
,RelaxedAtmosphere,2008-10-21T06:51Z,"update.. i have seeded 1250% and i don't plan on stopping anytime soon.  this compilation gets my highest marks. Stonedbg, you are thanked whole heartedly for this upload!! i shall seed forever!!"

For anybody who wants the rest of the Robbin' The Hood tracks, here's the link:

,darko999,2010-08-10T09:55Z,"@iwalkalone
I think he meant the date rape video is not there.  but also the video for wrong way is just an empty 114k file.  Another thing is I keep getting stuck at 99.8%  Seems to be that piece 486 is bad for everyone.  Anyone else having problems?"
,darko999,2010-08-10T10:04Z," **UPDATE**
Okay I downloaded 2.10 GB from a 1.70 GB file but it says I only wasted 151 MB with 75 hashfails. 0_o  Either way piece 486 finally downloaded with no hashfail! Woo-Hoo!  Thank you for this excellent torrent!  I will continue to see for a long while!"
,darko999,2010-09-02T11:10Z,"Another update... WTF is with song number 3 on Second Hand Smoke? It is supposed to be Romeo, but instead it is some weird techno song that is not at all Sublime...  Am I the only one who noticed this???"
,darko999,2010-09-02T11:10Z,...and the Wrong Way video is an empty file...

,elgo2006,2012-07-16T04:03Z,"Great band, and decent quality music. If you're looking to spend an hour correcting ID3 tags, this is the torrent for you. If you like your time, don't waste it if you want organised music."
,elgo2006,2012-07-16T04:05Z,"Great band, decent quality. If you're looking to spend an hour correcting ID3 tags, this is for you. If you value your time, this isn't the torrent for you (unless you enjoy having sloppily-labeled, barely organised music)."
