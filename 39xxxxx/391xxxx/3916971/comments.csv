,ian555,2007-12-06T21:22Z,"Thanks for this movie RubberTow, I've been looking for this for a while now.  I was trying to help you seed the other movie Gator, but being a newby at this, I guess I didn't seed it for long enough.  Sorry buddy.  I will seed this one longer this time, and hope others do the same for this one.  Thanks again."
,os2bulldog,2008-01-29T03:27Z,"2 seeders are listed, yet 3 hrs 15 min have elapsed and nothing has started downloading.

WTF is going on? I've downloaded multiple shows from here with as little as 1 seeder in the past and have always been successful."

That movie was called ""Greased Lighting""."
,RubberTow,2008-03-08T22:33Z,"os2bulldog: ""wtf is going on"" I guess that is that you unrealistically expect to get instantaneous uploads and you need to have more patience,=. I've downloaded movie copies for a year or more from one source. One was the best copy anywhere of Scarface, a way better copy than is on DVD if you can believe that. and it had 50 seeds. another was ""The last temptation of Christ"" which i got at about a kb a sec. for a year from one guy. patience is the hey, you MTV generation punks need to learn that. You can't have it all right in front of you instantaneously at your beck and call."
