,prithwi_86,2008-02-02T07:09Z,yup buddy dat's da whole idea.
,heartbreaker333,2008-04-14T16:47Z,this torrent is fake..it stops downloding at 61% the torrent is fucked up. don't bother...
,Zakkenayo,2008-04-24T06:44Z,"Dang, my system must be broken - I can't find the fake version. The file downloaded like greased Ex-Lax, and it plays perfectly (as a bonus, it doesn't have that giant-black-bar, landing-strip-picture look). Give me a prithwi rip any day of the week. Thanks, man, and please keep the ""fakes"" coming."
,prithwi_86,2008-06-01T06:02Z,Zakkenayo  thanx for the support
