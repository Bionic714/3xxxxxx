,Sillysauce,2007-12-07T15:59Z,"I've got no sound?? This happened to me before with 'Meet the Robinsons' and 'Deck the halls from' aXXo.
Never had this before.. what to do??

Been having this problem only with the last couple of movies. Rescue Dawn and American Gangster wich both are only a couple of weeks old worked fine??"
,mojopagoda,2007-12-17T11:43Z,"No sound.... sometimes audio works fine with Nero Vision but not WMP or DivX... Try a few different players as their CODEC pack might be different.  WMP is supposed to auto-DL new codecs but I reckon it doesnt work 100%.  Anyway, just an idea."
,stylishirish,2007-12-22T13:57Z,dont know if this helps but sometimes i wouldnt get sound using vlc player... there is a setting in the audio menu having something to do with changing the audio channel or device.... something about spif and surround as default... it is only on some movies...but if i change it to stereo l/r ...simple ..it works...sorry but i dont remember exactly...and im not sure if that is even what you are talking about
