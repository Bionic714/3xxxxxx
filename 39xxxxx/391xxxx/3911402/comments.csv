There is a fixed version out there, but if you DLed this one and don't want to waste 700MB,
here is one possible solution to fix it:

For this procedure you will need ca. 2 GB free hdd space.

open the avi in virtualdub, save audio as wav (File-> Save WAV).

open wav in an audio editor (Cool edit or audacity) (might be necessary to rename to mp3 before opening)
Go to 0:40:50,500. insert 0,9seconds (900ms) of silence.
Save as wav. Important, because virtualdub needs wav, not mp3.

Back in virtualdub, set ""video->direct stream copy"", and audio->WAV Audio (open your wav here),
set ""Audio->Full Processing Mode"", then ""Audio->Compression"" to mp3 CBR 128kbit 48kHz.
You can use VBR as well, but CBR is safer.

""File->Save as AVI"". Done. All in all this should take around 15 minutes on a mid range PC.

Hope that helps.
