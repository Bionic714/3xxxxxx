,Skvatalge,2008-01-26T00:22Z,"Hi. I also use Vista. I replaced the crack like the others, and for a little while it seemed like i was good. But after watching the intro-movie and chosing campaign, i ran into trouble. Just as the loading bar finnished loading the very first mission, i recieved an error and the game closed. 
I hope you know what to do.

Thanks for your time"

,Solside,2008-05-23T23:22Z,"Hey Guys, so i have everything installed and I can get to the main menu okay, but whenever I attempt to start a new campaign all the menu items disappear and i am left to look at the daemon guy fighting the dwarf looking person and it stays on that screen for...at least the amount of time it takes to drive to subway and back. I then tried to load a multilayer map and everything worked peachy. So any idea why the campaign wouldn't work but the single senerios would? :("
,Pignup,2008-05-30T18:46Z,"Thanks for a great game. It works fine, although I haven't patched it yet.

How to make it work:

1. Check if you have Windows SP 2 or higher installed. Else the game won't work. (I use XP don't ask me about Vista)

2. Download the game.

3. Use WinRar to extract the files.

4. Run ""Setup.exe"" (Located in the folder where you extracted the files) and follow the instructions to install the game.

5. Open the ""Crack""-folder (Also located in the folder where you extracted the files) and mark ""H5_Game.exe"". Press ""Ctrl+X"".

6. Go to ""C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Heroes of Might and Magic V\bin"" and press ""Ctrl+V"".

7. Double-click on ""H5_Game.exe"" and enjoy the game.

Note: This is exactly how I did, and it works fine for me. If it doesn't work for you, I can't help you. "
,ppgangster,2008-06-18T04:00Z,"I can't save the game while playing the campaign mode single player and the autosave can't either.  It is only my computer or you guys can save and start again whenever you want. 

The game works great though."
,AvatarOfGaia,2008-07-03T18:27Z,"This is the French version and patch for this one is very rare, and the latest patch doesnt exist for this game.... The most common version on the net, and its very bothersome......"
,wanziger,2008-08-21T02:45Z,Question! has anyone with Vista actually got this game working? I sure donÂ´t anyway
