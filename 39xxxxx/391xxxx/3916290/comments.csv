,MrFoam,2007-12-12T22:07Z,"Great CD, be sure to buy it when it's released, well worth the money to get a real copy!"
,Mysticum81,2007-12-13T03:46Z,"This is one album I'll pass on in the p2p version, and instead wait for the release. Getting an Ayreon album is like getting a new vinyl back in the 80s. Sliding the disc out, looking at the cover, ahhh... Thanks for sharing this, though. It's always great to share good music :)"
