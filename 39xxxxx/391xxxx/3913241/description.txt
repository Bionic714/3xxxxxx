# Ever had such an annoying message given by Windows?


      It has many other flavors:

      Cannot delete file: Access is denied
      There has been a sharing violation.
      The source or destination file may be in use.
      The file is in use by another program or user.
      Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use.
