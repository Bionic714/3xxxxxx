,Tataen89,2011-03-13T15:59Z,"А эта игра на русском языке или нам надо его скачивать?
Просто привычка играл на русском."
,glovecompartment,2011-03-13T21:44Z,The cd stereo audio won't work because this torrent has the game ripped of its redbook audio. It only has the low quality music of the dos version. 
,glovecompartment,2011-03-13T21:50Z,The game gives that error about the audio because it's trying to play the cd stereo 16 bit music that this rip doesn't have. It's ripped of the redbook music. It will play fine with the 8 bit music from the dos version though. 
,maxflat,2012-03-19T14:25Z,"I had the same problem with cd music when I first installed. I ran the install again, cancelled out, and it worked. "
