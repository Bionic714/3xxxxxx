,stroppytube,2007-12-10T17:31Z,Thanks... I remember watching this as a kid in the 70s...Very thought-provoking film!
,nightsongz2,2007-12-12T04:23Z,Just ripped and encoded The Omega Man tonight...it's available here: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3930614
,kasjo_peja,2008-02-20T19:01Z,Not a bad copy. I just don't understand what was the point to include the trailer in the avi. The last 5 min is waisted for the trailer. With no audio on the top of that! You could use the MBs to pack better sound for example.
