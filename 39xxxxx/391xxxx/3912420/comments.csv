,Superfletch,2007-11-28T09:01Z,"Sorry about the speeds guys...  this is my first torrent ever and I really don't know what I'm doing here...  :P  Anyhow, hope you enjoy it.  Boy I sure could use some lessons on how to use this software. Hopefully I did it right and you can use it. "
,balahir,2007-11-28T19:10Z,"A million thanks Superfletch! Are there other discs included in the FCE 4.0 package, such as content discs?"
,tazmania3,2007-11-28T19:53Z,"why use fce4 if there is fcstudio ?
and there is nocontent for that only for studio"
,Superfletch,2007-11-28T20:10Z,No Content Discs as far as I know. Anyhow this was the only file that I could find in the weeks of looking. I have installed it on my Macbook Pro and it works. SN is good too. I've heard that if you want the LiveType and other stuff you need to re install that from the 3.5 disks. I haven't tried that yet because I need to learn the FCE first.  :P Anyone know of any good tutorials. I'm trying to find a quick way to edit tandem skydiving footage faster and nicer than iMovie.
,balahir,2007-11-28T20:47Z,"Superfletch, are you still seeding? I am stuck at 66.8%...
taz: Some of us do not need the full FC suite, and FCE is a very good compromise inbetween FC and iMovie."
,adambigguy,2007-11-29T00:38Z,I have been checking daily for this one.  I am seeding as fast as i can!
,Superfletch,2007-11-29T01:22Z,Yup...  still seeding... But I'm on a slow DSL connection.
,vvvjb,2007-12-01T23:43Z,This is my first torrent ever. Can anyone tell me where the SN is located? Nothing works!
,hipauliee,2007-12-06T04:43Z,"yeah i just installed this on leopard and it works perfectly. the only question i have is how do you put video in reverse. in the old FC all you had to do was crtl+click and press speed and then reverse and it did it.

an answer would be sweet."
,Fritzthird,2007-12-08T04:06Z,"Hipauliee, try Command J to reverse your video clip.

I just found out that not all Filters are available in this upload : ("
,pirate4marc,2007-12-08T05:18Z,"i downloaded and now it says i can't open the RTF file and when i run the dmg, it begins to open and verify and then gives an error that says codec overrun. Any ideas?"
,Fritzthird,2007-12-08T05:23Z,"Pirate4marc, try skipping the verification process."
,pirate4marc,2007-12-08T13:28Z,"ok so I had to do it fast but I skipped the verify process.  It then went to the next step and gave me a similar error saying, ""no mountable file systems."" and the box title says the following disk images failed to mount.   Is it a corrupt file?

and what about the rtf? why wouldn't it open?
any help is appreciated!"
,martinuz,2007-12-09T10:20Z,Thanks!
,pirate4marc,2007-12-10T02:00Z,anybody got any ideas?

,Fritzthird,2007-12-17T14:24Z,"I think that , ""no mountable file system"" = corrupted or incomplete download."
,wagz0216,2007-12-18T00:16Z,"this torrent appears to be extremely healthy, i just started downloadin and it will probably be done before i go to bed!"
,pirate4marc,2007-12-18T18:35Z,If you are getting errors like i did (see above) or the No Mountable System Files... Redownload.  I did and now it works fine.  Can you install livetype from this download?

,satnapar,2008-08-09T12:05Z,"for those who can't install anything but livetype. first find and download a ""Final Cut Uninstaller"". it can be easily found on the web. then you are ready to continue. By the way I can't run LiveType. When i try to open it, it show the logo and after that quit. I tried to re-install it and i have the same problem. even when i install the Content DVDs the result is the same: double-click, logo, and nothing...."
