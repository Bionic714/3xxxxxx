Brief (very) history of this if you didn?t know: before there was Richard Hell and the Voidoids and Television, Tom Verlaine and Mr. Hell were in a band that went nowhere pretty quickly by the name of Neon Boys. This is a bootleg that came out a while back that some may not have heard. Love Comes In Spurts is not the same as the Voidoids track.
