all sounds from the vista beta. i find them a lot better than the final vista sounds, especially logon, logoff, startup, and shutdown sounds. they are all in .wav files so you can use them on any OS like xp and even vista itself! you must use winrar or winzip to extract the .rar file. get them at www.rarlabs.com or www.winzip.com. check out my other torrents!
