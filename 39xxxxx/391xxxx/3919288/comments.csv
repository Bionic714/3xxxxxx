,odinstorm,2007-12-03T21:58Z,Subs are hard embedded and no audio for most of movie. Don't bother with this unless you are Dutch.
,tulipandthistle,2007-12-03T22:27Z,"I'm not Dutch, I'm Scottish but can speak Dutch fluently, can I download it?"
,odinstorm,2007-12-03T23:06Z,"Perhaps I should have said don't bother to download this unless you can read Dutch as there is no audio. So, if you understand Dutch text, it would be advantageous if you wish to understand this movie.  As to whether you can download this movie - suit yourself. "
