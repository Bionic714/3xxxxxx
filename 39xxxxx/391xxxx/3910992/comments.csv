,sniper1999,2007-11-28T00:49Z,"Can anyone get this app to work?  Everytime I download it, I can see the movie to show you how to crack Mac CS3, but the actual crack never launches.  Is something wrong with the file?  Thanks!"

,gdrawlinson,2008-04-26T05:49Z,"wow this would be great if the app actually opened, any idea where i can actually get another copy of this program?"
,gdrawlinson,2008-04-26T06:46Z,this doesnt work! this is the same thing found on another site mac-torrents(dot)com search photoshop CS3
,regenradio,2008-04-29T17:16Z,The provided crack wouldn't open with Leopard but the one The_S0urce linked to worked. Thanks 
,Minerva.TheGift,2008-05-01T18:52Z,"After some work, I got this up and running.  Here's my logs along the way:
After mounting the larger .dmg file (ADBEPHSPCS3_WWE.dmg) I got the manual (as a webpage) and ""Adobe Photoshop CS3"" so I clicked on the later.
This opened up a folder viewer, so I clicked Setup, which started the installer.
After agreeing to the terms and leaving the install to the suggested folder, I hit next and it started installing.
This took a while (about 7 minutes) and I thought the install might've stalled out once or twice, but it did finally install.
Before opening PhotoShop, I mounted the Content .dmg and found that most of the stuff there doesn't really need to be installed, like the DNG Converter.
Now for the tricky part (if any of this is): applying the crack
The (very well put together) crack opens up an archive when double clicked on. One option is How To and the other is the crack.
In the how to section, there's a video file for each CS3 product, so I watched the PhotoShop one.
In Applications->Adobe Photoshop CS3-> there's a file called ADobe Photoshop CS3, and that's what the video said I need to drop into the crack app.
Sadly, I could not get the crack app to load (it kept giving me errors) so I opened up Photoshop and used the key:

1045-0145-0793-4716-9972-1853
and it worked, but said I only had 30 days before I had to activate it.
Now going back to the crack, I still couldn't get it to open, so I figured maybe I have to update my OS (I'm running Leopard.)
After the update (to ) I still have the same problem; opening the crack will show the app as it is on the little video until it finishes loading it's .dmg
Then if I try to open the crack I get ""The application AdobeR Design Suite PremiumR CS3 IS[k] (Universal) quite unexpectedly.""
I downloaded Arcticblue's updated crack, and this one actually would open.
I found it over at http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3863705/Adobe_CS3_Design_Suite_Premium_Crack_for_Leopard
I dragged the Photoshop CS3 file from the applications folder to the crack, and now it's working great!
For what it's worth, under ""About Photoshop"" this says it's version 10.0 (so if you want something newer, good luck on a patch.)

,Thalia42,2008-05-19T21:09Z,Getting nowhere with this. The downloaded file doesn't open much less do anything. I can open it in textedit and get some instructions followed by gooblydegook but there is nothing unzipping or mounting as an application. Anyone help here?
,the_Hiuka,2009-02-17T16:36Z,"I tried all cracks I could find at TPB, and this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3863705/Adobe_CS3_Design_Suite_Premium_Crack_for_Leopard actually worked (the others wonÂ´t even open).

And IÂ´m running TIGER, not Leopard, so the updated Leopard-crack works for Tiger as well."
,aussiedee,2009-03-30T04:29Z,"To Minerva.TheGift.....

Probably won't ever see this message...
I had the same issues. I used the serial number in that post which I got a green checkmark for Ps CS3 and I get the same message.. must activate in 30 days.... I downloaded the patch.. it launched but I get This file cannot be patched! So now what do I do?"
,Djnallad,2009-06-19T10:22Z,"IMPORTANT: This is how I got it working step by step.

1) Open the file ADBEPHSPCS3_WWE.dmg
2) Setup Photoshop
3) Once installed goto your applications and double-click on The photoshop app, this should open up a folder.
4) Open the Adobe Design Suite Premium CS3 [k] Crack Leopard.zip.
5) All you have to do is drop the photoshop app onto the 'Drag-Drop' part.
6) wait until it has finished patching then open up PHOTOshop"
