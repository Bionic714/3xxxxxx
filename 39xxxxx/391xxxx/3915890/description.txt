What if angels walked among us, and one of them fell in love with one of us?

That woman is Maggie (Meg Ryan), a pragmatic heart surgeon who doesn't believe in angels...until she meets Seth. Will love be their mutual destiny? Will they take the risks that shape that destiny? The choice is theirs to make.
