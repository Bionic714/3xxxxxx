,OzeTigerman,2007-12-04T12:48Z,"Highlight all files and use Winrar to unzip them, then use Winrar again on the first file (vace.001).
It all falls into place from there."
,phari,2007-12-13T08:38Z,"Have downloaded and done what was said with winrar but game opens, i get the companys name then the game shuts down, any ideas?"

,boy22,2007-12-23T16:55Z,"When all the files are unziped, click on the first file, has to be vace.001. Windows will ask you with wich program you want to run the file, choose ""winrar"" from the list and click on it. It will unzip the vace.001 file in folder and all you have to do is to click on the ""setup"". goodluck"
,phari,2007-12-25T10:39Z,"Thank you, tried it all again and it worked this time.  Took a lot longer to install as well so maybe it missed a few files before hand.  "
,Molngrabb,2008-01-01T22:47Z,"I've done everything right and run ""setup.bat"". It says ""All done! Enjoy another VACE rip"" Then nothing happens when I close it. And the ""endhouse.exe"" file is nowhere to be found! Help please!"
,buff43,2008-07-23T14:54Z,Yeah same for me. I run the.bat file and then get same message.
,haloe1,2008-12-09T09:26Z,me too. i finally gave up and deleted all of it
