The 2001 album by Raz Ohara, full of both haunting and intimate acoustic songs.

"There are so few records that are released these days that aren't easily compartmentalized, and The Last Legend is one that proudly resists being simply slotted. The only consistency to the disc is the way it's so relentlessly surprising without being gimmicky." Jason Ferguson
