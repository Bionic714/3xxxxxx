,djnforce9,2008-07-31T14:16Z,"I've seen this floating about the warez sites as megaupload links. Faster for me to get it here and I'm glad it's still being seeded. Thanks.

I'll see if I can get them all to work. If not, I'll just have to continue using the SNES and PSX versions for MMX 1-6 and the PC versions of X7 and X8 only."
,NietGarnet,2008-08-04T04:16Z,"I can not find the cracks for x6 and x7. Could someone email me the cd code for x8 and where I can locate a crack?

,Danielzxzx,2010-05-06T13:28Z,How come x3 no cd crack won't work? It still says that it cant find MMX3.exe but I renamed it and put it in the same folder.
,SHODANISHY,2010-12-24T07:07Z,"alrite heres what you do. on the main menu when you mount the iso theres a button called no-cd or cracks or something like that. click it. depending on which game you wanna play open the corresponding folder. look at the readme for more instructions. after following instructions you should click the crack program and a box should pop up firestar or something like that telling you to place the exe file somewhere. take the exe out of the program folder for the game (I.E. mmX3.exe) and drag it over the middle window of the firestar box. should take a bout a sec and the bottom of the firestar window should display some dialogue ""xxxxx.exe cracked"" or something similar. alternatively place the cracking program in the file folder itself and have it look for the exe file. either way is good."
