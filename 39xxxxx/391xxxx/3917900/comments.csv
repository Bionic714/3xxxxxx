,bluecoop73,2007-12-02T17:17Z,"THX Flightsimerr,

but cant install it for fsx ?! Seems like it only worx, if i install the erj 145 before to FS9 ?! But not without FS9 - or doing something wrong ??

regards"
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-02T18:18Z,"I""ll see if I can figure it out and I'll get back to yah. Sorry for the problems."
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-02T21:05Z,"First install the base package (FeelThere - ERJ 145 PIC.exe), then all of the service pacls (sp1, sp1a, sp1b) then install the update (picerj145lrxcd-1.2.6.exe). Install the FS9 version onto your FSX folder. Hope this helps"
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-02T21:05Z,Sorry I didn't put the install info up earlier.
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-03T01:45Z,"Well I have FS9 so I think it may only work if you have both versions of the game. FS9 and FSX. has anyone got it working that has standalone fsx? let us know how you did it. 


Thanks!! "
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-03T04:50Z,"This is how you install it in the event that you do not have fs9

1: create folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9 
1a: creat a file fs9.exe in the folder, if you are using vista you may have to go to control panel and folder options to make file extensions visable of known file types in order to change a text file to an .exe (i'm not sure if you need this step i just did it just in case. I beleive the software soley checks the registry)

2: Install FeelThere - ERJ 145 PIC.exe
3: install all the updates to the FS9 folder you  created.(not the fsx update yet)
4: Download FS registry Repair http://www.flight1software(dot)com/files/FS_Registry_Repair.exe
 ""change DOT with ."" duh.. 
download and run the registry repair for fs9. 

NOW FINALLY!!! when you go to run the FSX update ""picerj145lrxcd-1.2.6.exe"" the software accurately reads the fs9 registry and installs the appropriate files into FSX. 

TADA!!!!! I've tested this and it works perfect GOOD LUCK!!! "

,ruicp,2008-11-21T23:48Z,"
Thank you,

The plane works perfectly for the FSX,

My question is: is there any update to the FSX?

Since the plane has no inside and I can not get the ""SELF TROTLE"""
