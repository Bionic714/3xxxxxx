GENERAL FEATURES

    * Highly detailed Embraer ERJ 145
    * GMax exterior/interior models
    * Simulated systems : electrical, hydraulics, pneumatics, Fadec, bleed air, air conditioning,etc.
    * Photorealistic 2D panel with 5 multiple photorealistic subpanels : overhead, pedestal,...
    * Interactive 3D Virtual cockpit with rain effect
    * Detailed passengers cabin
    * Wingview
    * Numerous exclusive international liveries
    * Frame-rate friendly, 4 aircraft variants : 2D panel only, 2D panel + wingview, 2D+VC and 2D+VC+virtual cabin
    * Setup screen to optimize performances
    * Easy-to-use PAINT KIT

AIRCRAFT FEATURES

    * Realistic flight dynamics created and tested by an active ERJ pilot and based on manufacturer specifications. The plane operates extremely close to the real plane's specifications.
    * Dynamic virtual cockpit with rain effect and virtual cabin : Framerate friendly VC and virtual cabin. Almost every switch and knobs (including some custom ones) can be operated from the VC. The PFD, ND and the RMU created for both pilots so the captain can set his instruments differently from the first officer and vice versa
    * Digitized sounds set recorded from the real plane : engine, APU, batteries, air conditioning, passenger signs, clicks,... A very realistic audio experience !
    * Realistic animations : hydraulic suspension, flaps, slats, spoilerons, speed brakes, thrust reversers, landing gear, passengers door, cargo hatches, stairs,...
    * Detailed gear sequence
    * Reflective textures, dynamic shine, night lighting,...

PANEL FEATURES

    * System simulation : Electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic, pressurization system, APU that first time ever uses fuel from the fuel tank, 2 generators/engines, FADEC with ATTCS function, GPWS, overspeed and stall protection with stick pusher. Icing detection is fully simulated
    * FMS (Flight Management System) : One of the most realistic ever made. 5 different patterns simulated including HOLD, PROCEDURE TURN, etc SID/STAR with DME arc. Learn function : as you fly the FMS learns your flying habits and the prediction will be more accurate over time. DIRECT mode and editable RTE page with waypoint input and custom waypoint support. Advisory VNAV and more...
    * Display : Antialiased GDI+ graphics with special technique that makes the instruments movement smoother and more realistic. For users with lower end machines there is a setup option to finetune the ballance between quality and perfomance
    * Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) with multiple callouts
    * TCAS 2 : Traffic avoidance with an audio-visual Traffic Advisory and Resolution Advisory system
    * Setup utility : You can customize your ERJ by selecting regional settings, joystick setup and more. Flight director with 2 kind of bars, pressure setting in In or HPa, weight in pound or kilogram, Graphics settings, Startup modes; Dark and cold, Ready to engine start, Engines are on, Volume, and joystick button assigments for the special function
    * Pop up instrument EFIS screens for multi-monitor displays
    * Numerous warnings and caution messages
    * Very accurate AutoPilot control panel : overspeed and stall recovery functions act just like the real thing
    * Fully simulated APU sequences with link to fuel consumption : you will have to follow the correct procedures to avoid dry fuel tanks during flight !
