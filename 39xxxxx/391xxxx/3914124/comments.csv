,saint123_2001,2008-03-09T10:23Z,"Did you make this with Make Torrent v2?
If not there is a file called ""torrent for dummies""
in the 6 pdf  pages it gives instructions on copying cd audio files and converting them into a true cd file to upload on a veriety of p2p servers.  If you do this kind of thing and use cd's then you should checkout those two files there on TPB (the pirate bay)
the two files are instructions 1) make torrent for dummies & 2) make torrent v2"
,saint123_2001,2008-03-09T10:37Z,Sorry there Torrent maker which i am going to seed and but the program is named make torrent if you cant find it with a search im saint123_2001 search my uploads if you want it im affraid i couldn't recover torrent for dummies but i'll try again
,saint123_2001,2008-03-09T11:45Z,you can find the two files I was refering to at this pirate bay page there are those files and others.  I have recovered those two deleted files and have posted and uploaded them as well.  Well Thanks for the music aladin4u

,jorvald,2008-03-28T17:28Z,Snyggt jobbat. Tackar så mycket
,wnrkrv,2008-03-31T17:10Z,I could rip and upload this in FLAC if you're interested.
,bluekalyx,2008-03-31T18:42Z,"Ligeti? Pendrecki? Holst? Gorecki? Glass, Riley, Reich? Messaien? 

This compilation is sorely lacking."
,MartinGilmour,2008-04-03T22:42Z,"Nice one !! 
but why is that ""013. Ludwig van Beethoven - Symphony No. 7 (Op. 92)"" sounds as if it were played on a cheap keyboard from the mid 80ies."
,axeonfluke,2008-04-24T08:29Z,"I don't see how you can just leave Strauss off a top 100 classical music torrent.  Seems silly to omit him.  I'll look elsewhere, thanks anyway. "
,mitch1995,2008-04-27T22:10Z,thankyou aladin4u very much
,etereo,2008-04-29T09:43Z,anybody had luck with the id3 tags?
,bensyo,2008-05-01T00:43Z,thank you!!!
,DenialTwist,2008-05-04T00:43Z,"what a nightmare to deal with. when it uploaded into my media player, complete nightmare. don't download unless you wanna be sitting there for hours editing everything so it's understandable."
,Rnetboy,2008-05-21T00:04Z,"it will be good if u rip this to 320kbs , because this is   a low quality"
,fairytales,2008-06-01T00:29Z,"wonderful collection ,thank u "
,apaial34,2008-06-09T09:28Z,I agree with what you said martinglimour. i think aladin4u couldnt find the original anywhere online so he dusted off his old keyboard and played it himself lol
,clarkbai,2008-06-10T14:51Z,"big thx.

downloading"

,Hapero^,2008-06-13T02:17Z,Laughed so hard and even harder when heard the song :D
,bobbobbins666,2008-06-15T15:52Z,"thx, really enjoyed listening to these..shame the quality isn't the best, but still well worth the download!"
,lazur-e,2008-06-27T18:44Z,"@andersjjensen & denialtwist: there are tools for automatic correction of id3 tags, no need to do it manually."
,spilt.milk,2008-07-02T12:46Z,"@lazur-e: still takes awhile though as you do need to manually convert some of the track titles and artist fields where you have special characters. And for me who doesn't know very much of classical music I had to google them so I can use the 'did you mean:' correction tool. Tag&Rename at least fixed them for the most part though. 

For those of you who need it: http://www.softpointer.com/tr.htm

Thanks for the music aladin4u."
,jolodoshshu,2008-07-04T12:05Z,ty
,peteisneat,2008-07-09T03:22Z,"Thank you. Good download speeds. As for play back quality, I am using a dedicated player. Cool Edit pro and a good sound system. Just a sugestion so you 2 can get the most from this D/L."
,raul.td,2008-07-17T14:52Z,"THANK YOU very good torrent!
like U :-D"
,Maoxx,2008-08-11T01:38Z,"Yeah, it's not the TOP 100, you could always debate that, but this is a really good mix! Yes the Moonlight sonnata is just a midi file, which is just horrendous, other than that quality is decent. 

For gayboy who namedrops a lot of obscure shit he thinks should be here, go fuck yourself, you're just being a pretentious dick and everyone knows it."
,Tolle44,2008-08-24T21:00Z,"Hearing that the no. 13 of Ludwig Van Beethoven sounded crap, I thought I might just listen it up as well, and it turns out that the bad quality isn't the most surprising, but the fact, that this piece isn't "" Ludwig van Beethoven - Symphony No. 7 (Op. 92)"", but in fact the ""Piano Sonata #14 Adagio Sostenuto"" - which is better known as the Moonlight Sonata.

This download is full of wrong info, but at least it's good classical music, so what the heck :) Thanks for the upload aladin4u!"
,Tijd,2008-09-04T18:47Z,"Curse you, bad tagger! While renaming everything, I noticed song #64 is missing from this download. Still worth it though, but sure is a pain in the ass."
,CsOH,2008-09-13T19:49Z,Beethoven's 9 symphony must be on 1-st place!!!
,amority,2008-10-12T02:30Z,"BULLSHIT!
This ain't any fucking top 100 of the Classics for any NORMAL music lover. Most of these are crap - quality is more than shit, selected songs are mostly around 150-500 places from the TOP 500.

I guess there was only 10 songs what can be in the TOP 100 CLASSICAL SONGS ALL TIME. Other songs, especially from Mozart, Beethoven, Vivaldi, Bach, Rachmaninoff, Grieg.. they just not presented here what IS THE BEST CLASSICAL music.

This torrent presents only this torrent founder's personal choices and nothing more. Really.

,dennix2,2008-10-24T09:11Z,"Hey amority, 
Why are you shitting this aladin? Your last sentence would have been enough.
Thnx"
,stylishirish,2008-10-27T20:12Z,I will upload a 700mb collection that maybe some of you might enjoy - of course this is the uploaders preference... just like this one
,stylishirish,2008-10-31T02:49Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4471345/Classical_Compilation_CD

i agree with dennix2

and i think a thank you would be sufficient for aladin4u 

as with the 'indie' music scene, popularity does not always mean 'quality' ... classical music is no different - just older"
,Lord007,2008-11-01T10:52Z,thanks a lot
,cassiopee,2008-11-11T11:54Z,"Aladin, thank a lot for this sharing. 

I'm new to classical music, and i appreciate your work. And if somebody can share a better classical collection, let's share it, and please stop to make a destructor comments.

If something is wrong in a collection, you can write something kind for our friend aladin in order to improove the quality.

Writing comments is more easy than sharing, so thanks a lot my friend aladin, i appreciate your work, and you help me to discover this delicious music.

Cassiopee from Africa."
,cowhammer,2008-11-20T01:34Z,"I know at least one track that isn't what it says it is. 013 - Beethoven's Symphony 7 isn't that. It's his Moonlight Sonata, and a terrible version of it at that. It sounds like someone recorded it on a $50 synthesizer."
,Corkus007,2008-11-28T11:47Z,Thanks aladdin4u! I lost my good classical songs and I can't remember most of their names... I'm looking for certain song played by a chello especially... Hoping it's here!
,Infinitex2,2008-12-06T02:45Z,"Well, a little crazy with the tagging...and the freaking long names and characters.

But I like a lot of these, so thank you very much."
,stylishirish,2008-12-08T20:53Z,"a lot of the same pieces, but a little more. this torrent (aladin's) has better bitrates however.

,True-Haven,2009-02-14T05:16Z,"Hey Corkus007!!!

If you ever read this, listen to Apocalyptica
They base themselves around 4 chellos!
You'd love them
If you ever read this again that is lol"
,guimanaus,2009-03-09T23:56Z,Ouch!!! Very good Work! Thanks a lot! 
,Galypso,2009-03-17T19:08Z,"If you like it, 

Why not?"
[V],DieselHopper,2009-04-11T04:28Z,"The music is all great but I did notice some random blips and cuts. I suspect interruption during a file conversion. Also, the ID3 are strange and unorganized."
,_nrXIV_,2009-04-26T11:09Z,"Amority, I do believe you to be slightly retarded!
Certainly, this is the opinion of the founder. I you are looking for ""the real"" top 100 then I´d believe that you would be better off putting it together yourself! Personally I find this to be an excellent collection!"

,thesupermedium,2009-06-09T05:59Z,Don't know if a torrent has ever gone so fast for me on this site - well over 500 kb/s and approaching 600! Thanks! :]
,thesupermedium,2009-06-09T06:00Z,"And good music too, though many of these artists are not ""classical"", but rather Baroque and Romantic. It's assumed we all knew that tough ;]"

,LeSet,2009-07-25T13:08Z,"@ amority 

Well you egghead, this is not tekno, house or some spun on radio hit for the 1000 000 time

THIS IS CLASSICS, real classics, so no it's not the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's 90's - Whatever

Get your head out your ass and be greaful, cause in the REAL WORLD, music cost money and you got this stuff for free!

ASSWIPE!

,ehagglun,2009-08-22T11:44Z,"Okay, I appriciate this upload, there's a lot of good music... HOWEVER!
