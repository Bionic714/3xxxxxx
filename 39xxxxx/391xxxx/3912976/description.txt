Sorry about the quality.  The original is a lower quality VCD.  I used Nero to transcode and MicroTorrent to make the torrent.  Best viewed with VLC.

Spoken language is Oriental (Chinese?) but subtitles in English.

This the second film about thailand from the perspective of a sex-tourist.
Of course, this is meant to be a shocking \"made-for-tv\" movie.  Everything in this video was true at the time and everything you see is still available in one form or another.

This country is well worth visiting from many points of view, including this one.

Of course, if you are going for the sex, then Bangkok is the place to start.  Do Patpong, Nana Plaza or any of the other spots in Bangkok but only for a short time.  

If you are spending more than a couple of days in this country then by any way possible - get yourself to Pattaya.
