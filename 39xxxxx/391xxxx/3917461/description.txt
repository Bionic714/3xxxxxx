Fist Of Fun Series Two 

Fist Of Fun is the series that Lee & Herring are possibly best known for. 
Running over three series & four years, spanning radio & television, it drew material from the duo's previous works and live shows as well as a number of new ideas. 
Starting life on BBC Radio One in late 1993, it ran for six episodes and maintained a similar delivery & performance style that the duo had already established within their previous radio show, Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World.
However, the content of the show was vastly different. Whereas "Nimrod" set a theme for each show, thus creating a context, Fist Of Fun's only context stipulation was that the material should fit into the format of a "Lifestyle show presented by two blokes in their mid 20's who live in separate, but equally unpleasant, rented accommodation in South London'".
That meant that pretty much anything was allowed to be included, giving Rich & Stew more freedom in their material, and the incessant talk of daytime TV and other mundanities coming from two people who were clearly very intelligent struck a chord with the nation's listeners.
Maintaining a stay of only one series on radio one, as the station moved away from the half hour comedy show format. Fist Of Fun returned on BBC2 television in early 1995.
Broadcast over six weeks, going out at 9pm on Thursday nights throughout April & May, it was an immediate success, although not an instant rating winner, and Lee & Herring enjoyed a brief tenure as media darlings while they were hailed as the next big thing.
