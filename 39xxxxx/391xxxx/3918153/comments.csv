,yumikasan,2008-09-26T12:13Z,"Damn frustrating, isn't it. All you get is 93.9%. The original uploader, anonyfish, appears not to be very committed to his/her work. But that's what you get on a site like this. No one is held accountable for what they do as opposed to sites for which you sign up :-)"
