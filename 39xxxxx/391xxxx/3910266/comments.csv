,Infamouz88,2007-12-21T06:38Z,"Key gen doesnt work!!!
Dont make a torrent if you havent tested it urself!!"
,Parkerccool,2007-12-21T08:18Z,"Everything works fine. The only snag i did encounter is that when your running the exploit there is a dropdown menu and you have to choose the right edition your running. Its converting Season 3 of Weeds right now and i already put episode 1 on my ipod and watched it. The only other thing to watch for is aspect ratio, because if the aspect ratio is set at widescreen i haven't found a way to not make the video squish, but its not that big of a deal for me since its all free anyways and when it comes down to it our grandparents were watching b&w films with no sound 60 years ago so who are we to complain about quality anyways?"
,Parkerccool,2007-12-21T08:20Z,P.S. I run windows XP
,Parkerccool,2007-12-21T08:20Z,P.S. i run windows XP
,solu,2007-12-29T06:48Z,key gen worked but it crashes when i select files to convert
,djnue,2008-01-09T02:25Z,"Thankz Tiven 

Works Fully And Great
Comes Up 150 Days Old But Datz Not Dat Old"
,Tiven,2008-01-17T23:33Z,"Keygen works fine.

You obviously have to select ""Ultimate DVD+Video Converter Suite"" from the drop down list in the keygen.

Dont say that it doesnt work if you dont know how to use it..."

,norann,2008-02-12T16:15Z,"The virus warning is associated with the keygen but rather than telling everyone to quit bitching I ran it and created a few keys. Any of the following should work.

Just dont extract the keygen and you shouldnt get any virus warnings.
Program seems to be working just fine for me."
,Yggdrasil1964,2008-03-12T00:12Z,"Crashes for me too, if I try to convert a .flv file from YouTube."
,pablo26,2008-04-12T12:33Z,keygen is rubbish & now i got virus stay away from this 1
,theTribble,2008-06-02T17:03Z,"Works great, thank you Tiven. There's no virus or  anything, look at the number of seeders (currently 27) if you need proof. Been looking for a working video converter for ages. Thanks."
,XSYLUS,2008-07-03T08:39Z,AVG reports virus - be cautious!
,crackheadkid,2008-07-08T02:21Z,"According to AVG...as stated...it has a virus.

just download it, and use the email + keycode for those who have been successful in running the keygen. (listed below...above?)

thats what i did, and it works just fine.

somewhat good torrent."
,warlord2080,2008-07-18T06:22Z,there was no problems with this one the only problem is if you have a very big file like say 700 mb it will take a long time...
,gromit190,2008-07-19T21:26Z,The keygen is a trojan virus. (I am usingAVG free 7.5)
,bearsaj99,2008-08-09T01:16Z,"Great torrent it worked perfectly for me. Just download it, unzip it, install the software, launch the keygen and get your key. IT takes a bit after you register for the program to work. For me atleast. Great torrent. 

No viruses or trojans. If your virus protection says it is just because of the coding in the keygen that makes the virus protection scared."

Frustrating"
