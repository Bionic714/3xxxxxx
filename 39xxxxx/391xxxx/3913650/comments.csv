,GandalfGudith,2008-02-24T10:47Z,Thanks everyone for seeding!  I'll set this to high priority once I'm done getting Eureka Seven (and after I seed that for a bit...only a handful of seeders) so I can get it and seed it for anyone else that wants it ^^

,Zero-Hero,2008-03-07T03:04Z,"I've seen all these but just want it for collection. 150 eps 26GBs to download. 33 Seeders when I started. 

I will seed this for 2 months if I can get it all soon.

Nice upload 7xxxx."
,Zero-Hero,2008-03-07T03:07Z,"7xxxx why not just upload another batch 151 - 200 when its all out.(wont be long woot!) That way we won't have to download all this again.

Bah stupid me and double posting."
,Gods-Flaw,2008-03-10T00:07Z,"Guys,

You know you can get eps 50+ including the movie directly from dattebayo (www.dattebayo.com/t).  Each ep has more then 50 folks seeding it.

For the first 49 eps that DB did not sub you can find the lunar subs at my torrent.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3974298/[Anime][Lunar]_Bleach_1-49_[GF]

We may only have 13 seeders but it is only 8.3 gig and the rest of the eps you can download MUCH faster from DB directly."
,xwillex,2008-03-12T18:36Z,"omg its like 50 ppl thats ""online"" but only 5 seeds xD
I swear that i will seed this when i'm done :P"
,darkflare000,2008-03-13T07:44Z,"Lets see if I can see this forever shall we? 
I dont see things for long after I get them. General any where between 3 days to a few weeks depending on what it is.

I'm downloading it to external device, and hopefully i can be added straight to this torrent if I crash and need to reinstall everything.

A big thanks to 7xxxx.

Just made two Bleach fans happy!"
,remny,2008-03-31T20:11Z,"What language is this in?  English dubs, or english subs?"
,0_o,2008-04-26T19:31Z,Subbed?
,nebbo13,2008-05-05T15:03Z,i need more seeds pple. all im getting in leechers and if that continues im gonna be on 99:99:99 to finish the download
,kristofferalpsjo,2008-07-22T10:12Z,"People! Please, seed! I added this torrent in February! Thanks."
