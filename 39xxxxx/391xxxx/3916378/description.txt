The last time we saw Evan Baxter, he was being tormented by rival Bruce Nolan on screen, live from their Buffalo TV station. But as time passed and Evan has made up with Bruce, he's gone onto bigger and better things. Newly elected to Washington D.C. as a congressman, Evan has left Buffalo, New York in pursuit of a greater calling. But that calling isn't serving in the illustrious ranks of America's politics, but being summoned by the Almighty himself, who has handed Evan the task of building a new ark, much as Noah did before. With time passing by and his family belittled by Evan's newfound realization, Evan will have to do the work that God has given him in what promises to be an unusual adventure for a man who just wanted to serve his country, might actually be serving humanity

God (Freeman) vraagt nieuwbakken Congreslid Evan Baxter (Carell) om een Ark te bouwen om de wereld te redden van een tweede grote overstroming, net zoals Noach dat ooit kreeg opgedragen. Evan's familie denkt aanvankelijk dat hij mentaal ingestort is, maar na verloop van tijd blijken er wel degelijk Bijbelse motieven in het spel te zijn
