KFC Skin Piles is a 12" EP by Buckethead, with quotes, movie samples (mainly taken from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre), guitar shards, and beats. The point of the album was for DJ's to remix and scratch for themselves, this is why the album was never released on CD. It is currently out of print.

"A2" begins with a rendition of the song "Pirates Life for Me" previously featured on the album Giant Robot and his demo tape Bucketheadland Blueprints. "B1" features samples from the Michael Jackson song "Thriller".
