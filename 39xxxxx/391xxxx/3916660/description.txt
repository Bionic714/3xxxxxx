Plastics - Welcome Plastics (1979)

Crazy Japanese electro-pop with silly, English nonsensical lyrics. A must-hear for every fan of Devo, B52's and other electro-goodness. I'm putting it up here because I've spent a long, long time looking for it and I don't think I'm the only one.

My upstream isn't really impressive, but I'll seed as long as possible - hopefully someone with a better connection will help out at some point.

Enjoy! ;)
