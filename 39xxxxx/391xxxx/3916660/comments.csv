,phydeau3,2011-01-13T00:06Z,"Wow! I saw The Plastics lead off for the B-52s. I wasn't quite ready for them, but I bought this album at the show and still have the vinyl in my collection. Thanks, lillesvin, for making this available! I'll seed the shit outta this one because it's so hard to find. "

Seeding so others can enjoy!"
