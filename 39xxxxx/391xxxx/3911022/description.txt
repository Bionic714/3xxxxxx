Twice a year, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints holds a general conference of the Church.  The Prophet, Apostles, and other leaders of the Church give talks on the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

These are the MP3 files taken from http://www.lds.org for every talk from the October 2007 General Conference, excluding Priesthood Session.
