,Skylink*Wien,2007-11-28T19:24Z,can u confirm that this works with zurich also?
,FlightSimerr,2007-11-28T19:27Z,He say's in the first paragraph that it does not work with zurich.
,punit69,2007-11-28T20:20Z,"Sorry guys but ma after the crack i have connection to a pirate site, i have on my PC credit card data i have a big problem now, fuck it russian crack"
,dbg19,2007-11-28T20:42Z,"Warning, it connects to a bogus pirate IP!!!

Also, it DOESN'T work with the Phantom. It will only work for a while, but it quits after some time."
,palmofsweden,2007-11-28T21:15Z,Fucking cloud9 guy! He has even posted a reseed just over this.
,fulcrum_21,2007-11-28T21:52Z,"THIS CRACK WORKS! And there is no virus or trojan. You can check it with any virus-scanner. The reseed was also posted by me, cause there were problems reported with my first post. The crack is also available on WoS, no problems with viruses or trojans there too. Don't let bother you by comments of cloud9-people. Just be careful with upcoming pseudo-cracks and new dl-products by cloud9. On the other hand, they'll be out of business very soon. So the crack is also very helpful to those who bought cloud9-products and will miss their support in the future. "
,punit69,2007-11-28T22:08Z,Very strange fulcrum_21 you are a guy of Cloud9? or your name is Sangalli? on my pc the problem persist.....
[T],stevekasian,2007-11-29T10:16Z,"Disregard these little twinks ""dbg19"" and ""punit69"", copying and pasting their same comments into the reseed post.

These two are the REAL Cloud9 employees.

This is 100% legit, cross referenceable and completely confirmable. All u gotta do is know where to look.  ...And if u don't know where to look, then you probably shouldn't be DLing cracks from the interent anyway. lol"
,777-200LR,2007-12-27T13:22Z,DON'T DOWNLOAD ! THIS SHIT ALSO HAS A TROJAN ! Win32:Agent-FMH [Trj]
,Philipvj,2008-01-04T11:26Z,hey man whens the Zurich x crack out?
,KingMusjo,2008-01-25T01:03Z,"This does indeed work!!! Disconnected my internet connection and it worked perfect in ""offline"" mode aswell...

However, I got to work with AMS, LAX etc., by copying the bglman.dll/dat from an older version! But how are you suppose to install newer sceneries like Bergen wich uses the new version of Addon Manger???
When I try it, the bglman.dll gets overwritten - I then replace it, with the older version, but that results in the disappearance of the Bergen FS9 menu from the Cloud9 Addon Manager in FS2004?!
Am I the only one experiencing this, and has someone else succesfully activated Bergen for FS9 with this crack? If so - how? :)

A little help here would be hot! :-)"
,Jassie1013,2008-01-27T13:28Z,"@ KingMusjo

Which torrents bglman.dll/dat did you use? Where did you get those from?"
,KingMusjo,2008-01-30T16:46Z,"For this to work, you need to use bglman.dll version 1.0.0.30 in conjunction with esellerate crack (from here!)

Also, Amsterdam Full 1.04 and Bergen 1.01 dosen't work - you need to upgrade from Amsterdam 1.03 and Bergen 1.00"
,KingMusjo,2008-01-30T16:48Z,"I got AMS Full 1.03, Bergen 1.00 (plus required updates to run AES on these sceneries!) and the bglman.dll v1.0.0.30 + esellerate crack! 

If anyone need any of it (or all of it!) i'll just upload it!"
,A320_1,2008-01-31T18:08Z,"Hello,
Where can I download the bglman 1.0.0.30, i canÂ´t find it here.

many Thanks"
,KingMusjo,2008-01-31T23:38Z,"Hey... Please read this thread at WingZ of Silence... I have been posting on it aswell... the sceneries is also available there... 

It's a bit tricky... :)

,KingMusjo,2008-01-31T23:58Z,"Hey A320_1 and all others who where asking about this!

I just uploaded this...

Containes bglman.dll 1.0.0.30 and eSellerate crack to use with Cloud9 sceneries - but the main thing is here, that it's working (with a little detour) with the newest updates AMS 1.04 & BGO 1.01 with AES Support!!!

,GoldenScimitar,2008-05-15T01:30Z,"The real problem is this:

There are no complete Cloud9 or FSDreamTeam downloads in TPB under the same BGLMan crack. So basically, even if I install 2 sceneries from Cloud9 that are under the same BGLMan, if I tried to install another Cloud9 airport available from TPB with a different BGLMan version, then that particular one will work, but the other cracks will be overwritten, making it hard to complete a full Cloud9 collection.

My request is, ALL Cloud9 sceneries under the SAME BGLMan crack. Please respond back to this. Thanks."
