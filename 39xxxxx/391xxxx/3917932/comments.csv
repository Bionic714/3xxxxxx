,Mark1200Yeah,2007-12-14T16:03Z,"I just don't get how to mount this with Daemon Tools. So, how should I mount this. I've heard people talking about mounting image and stuff like that. I don't get anything...."
,Harry_P,2007-12-23T01:34Z,"""mounting"" basically means loading the image onto a virtual drive (Daemon Tools, Alcohol, etc. create this virtual drive for you, which uses existing space on your Hard Drive).  From there, treat it like you have a new DVD-ROM in an extra DVD drive.  Make sense?"
,Lethal_Ranger,2007-12-23T09:27Z,"I've been having the same issue for a while now with a lot of game torrents.

People often say to un-rar things, and then mount it afterwards. But after I un-rar an ISO file I can't mount the new file.

Am I supposed to mount the old ISO file? I tried that and it didn't work. Is there a file within the folder I created (by un-rar-ing in the first place) that I need to mount?

(Using Daemon Tools)"

,Lightning_Blood,2008-08-16T21:53Z,"READ PLEASE BEFORE YOU  DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!!!!!! 

>>>>>>>Guide how to download IF it have happened before that you get some error if you download, an error somthing like you have download too much or somthing, i cant quite explain, but here is somthing you SHOULD do, you should try to download ONLY ""1"" or ""a"", the first file, and then skip ""2"" or ""b"", When 1 is done, you find ""1"" or ""a"", then you move it some place else, like on your desktop, or in /C, just somwhere else then your PC / Laptop, then you choose ""Dont Download"" or the ""1"" or ""a"", then you start downloading ""2"" or ""b"", now, READ MORE BECAUSE I'M NOT DONE, then you reboot your PC/Laptop suddenly, i mean like pressing the ""Power On / Off"" button, down for like 5 seconds, NOT just clicking ""Start"" and then ""Shut down computer"", i mean sudden restart, then, start the PC/Laptop up again, and now when you've logged in and everything, you start up your ""UTorrent / BitTorrent / BitComet or something like that, the torrent downloader thingy, then your download should start a Checking process thingy, now, when its done, it will download more, and you will not get that error that you had when you downloaded both at same time. THEE END!

Gawd... I know this is a long guide, if anyone knows something else then please come with it!"
