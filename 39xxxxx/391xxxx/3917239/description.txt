Val Kilmer delivers what was considered one of 1991\'s best performances as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone\'s hallucinatory bio-pic of the seminal 1960s rock group The Doors. Stone cuts a jagged swath through Morrison\'s life, starting with a childhood memory where Morrison sees an elderly Indian dying by the roadside. It picks up with Morrison\'s arrival in California and his assimilation into the Venice Beach culture, followed by his film school days at UCLA; his introduction to his girlfriend Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan); his first encounters with Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan); and the origin of The Doors Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ made up of Manzarek, Robby Kreiger (Frank Whaley), and John Densmore (Kevin Dillon). As the fame of The Doors grows, Morrison\'s obsession with death increases. The band grows weary of Morrison\'s missed recording sessions and no-shows at concerts. Morrison, meanwhile, sinks deeper into a drug-induced haze, having mystical sexual encounters with Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan), an older rock journalist involved with sadomasochism and witchcraft.
