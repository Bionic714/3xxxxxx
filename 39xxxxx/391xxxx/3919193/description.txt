  No levels. No load times. Just never-ending action that doesn't stop until 
  you leave the game!

  Tony Hawk's American Wasteland gives you - for the first time ever in a Tony
  Hawk game - the freedom to skate or bike, throughout a rich, expansive open
  environment. Once you arrive in Los Angeles, the vast city that gave birth
  to skate culture, the sky's the limit as you progress through the Wasteland 
  story and choose missions that will have you immersed in the action without 
  ever skating the same line twice!
