,BLuNTeD,2007-12-12T17:10Z,"well, i downloaded this, and i have to say im not impressed with this rip at all,,, i have quite a high end system that is more than capable of running this game ( i have an athlon 64 4200+ X2 dual core CPU, 2gb of corsair XMS platinum series ram, and a geforce 8800GTX 768mb graphics card) i get major lag with the game, it stutters all the time, when i try and do manual tricks it doesnt work(both with keyboard, and my saitek gamepad) and also the audio is extremely corrupted to,,, 

though thanks for uploading this game as i have had a chance to try it out first before i decide to buy it, i think the problems is probably because this is a pirated copy, and thats why im experiencing these problems...
"
,BLuNTeD,2007-12-12T17:11Z,"p.s. i wont be seeding it, as i have deleted it from my system now, sorry to all those who are looking to download this, if i were u i would look for another version coz this one is poor,,,

ive tried various drivers for my 8800GTX old ones and new, and i still experience all the problems mentioned in my last comment..."

,000101000dude,2008-08-04T12:55Z,"It would seem the nerds capable of making all these games work properly think very highly of themselves and feel the need to insult others rather than help them. Do the world a favor and help someone out instead of bitching like a little girl over a few lines of text.

Alright, it's fairly simple - unrar (extract) ONE file, in CD1. Makes more sense to start with rld-thwa.rar -- Repeat that process with all CDs and install. Use Daemon Tools to mount each .cue file you extract.

The Crack I haven't gotten to yet (installing CD5 atm) but again, its very easy. Since I don't know exactly where the Crack is yet, I'll just repost the link above.  www.gamecopyworld.com - You should copy and paste this crack where the game was INSTALLED over the main .exe file.

Should be able to play it from there but don't forget to Update the game itself."

,certa0,2008-08-29T17:40Z,"I'm looking for some in depth on controls... The game gives no customization, I have to use JoyToyKey hit and miss mapping to get a decent control layout. Nice rip. The game appears to run as flawless as the retail version. Thanks but there's no guides or nothing on controls so I'm stuck in Beverly hills on the spine transfer mission I've tried evry damn key on my keyboard while in the air over the spine and cannot perform a spine transfer... If I find it I will post it up."

ok when it is installed go 2 the crack on the desktop(i told u to do this and where at the start)open file this click patch install the update/patch,then go to where u saved it the cdrive if u cant find it just right click the tony hawk icon for the start up and the click open file location and it will take u to where u installed it 
ok now open the crack file and u will see the crack(not the patch dnt click that)drag that over to where u installed the game then u will see the game file drop the crack into that 
it will ask u some stuff click move and replace 
then u will have the game oh yea one more thing u play the game u need to click the game file then the thing that said thaw and the game will start,to chang the controls click the game starter on the desktop and it will come up with controls u can chang just dnt click save and play click save and quit u can use a xbox360 controler to hope this helpd and its fine for me i can save it too "
