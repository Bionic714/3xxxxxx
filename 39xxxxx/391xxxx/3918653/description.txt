From Amazon.com:
In The Science of Superman, gifted science writer Mark Wolverton takes up the challenge and answers these very questions. Examining Superman's powers through the lens of modern science, Wolverton explains the fundamental biological and genetic differences between Earthlings and Kryptonians that allow Superman to exercise extraordinary abilities on our planet. For the first time anywhere, you'll understand the logic and science that underlie Superman's "super powers." You'll never look at the Man of Steel the same way again.
