He butchered his victims in secret for more than three years, turning his apartment into a grisly slaughterhouse filled with human heads and stripped flesh.
He even took photographs of their corpses so he could later look back and relive the experience of murder. 

He found teenagers and young men at bus stops, bars and the streets. He lured them to his apartment by promising drinks,
pornographic videos and even money to some in exchange for sex. 
once inside his apartment, he would slip a potent sedative into their drinks, strangle them and then dismember their bodies with an electric saw. 
On occasion, he ate some of their flesh. 
But the secret and bizarre world of this serial killer would eventually be revealed. On July 22, 1991, two Milwaukee police officers talked to a man named 
Tracy Edwards. There was something odd about him. Handcuffs were dangling from one of his wrists. 
Edwards told police a strange tale of a man who held him hostage and threatened him with a knife. 
The man's name was Jeffrey Dahmer. 

The Grisly Discovery 
Edwards led the two officers to Dahmer's one-bedroom apartment at 924 North 25th Street. 
They were met by Dahmer, 31, who answered the door, and an overwhelming stench. Edwards instructed police to look in the bedroom for a knife.
When an officer went inside the room, he found photographs of human remains. The other officer opened the refrigerator and quickly slammed the door shut when he saw a human head inside. 
Investigators found seven skulls, four heads, body parts and photos of naked and dismembered victims inside the small apartment. 
Human remains were found preserved in formaldehyde, and heads had been boiled. Dahmer told police how he had poured acid over flesh to dissolve remains.
He had kept strips of flesh in his freezer for later consumption. 
Dahmer was unmasked to the world as one of America's most notorious serial killers. He gave police a 160-page confession detailing how he lured, 
murdered and then dismembered the remains of his victims. He provided gruesome details of a killing spree that began in 1978 in Ohio and stretched to Wisconsin by 1991. 

"It's hard for me to believe that a human being could have done what I've done, but I know that I did," Dahmer said in his confession.

The trial of jeffey dahmer provides a vivid and shocking account of the activities of a serial killer.
The trial itself was disinguished by a masterly summary from the court appointed forensic scientist and hinges on the prosecutions attempts to prove that dahmer knew what he was doing when he enticed ,
killed and dismembered his victims...

This programme is of great interest to all concerned with the issue of insanity as a defense , 
determine for yourself how and why dahmer delighted in killing black youths.....
