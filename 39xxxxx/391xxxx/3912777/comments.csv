,Jan-Bertil,2007-11-28T17:33Z,"@Hwizard:
THanks for the upload. But can you tell how this torrent differ from http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3897074/Kane_and_Lynch_Dead_Men-HATRED ?
Is anything fixed in your upload? 'Cause I just cannot get the game to start, as I have written in the other thread. I asked there also, if my Gf6800 128Mb really wasn't supported. In the readme file on the iso, it's not included in the supported videocard-list. However, since Gf6600 is said to be supported (& some cards below that) I find it hard to believe my card wouldn't work. Anyway, if you claim this torrent to be any different than the one 'loder' uploaded, I'll sure give it a try."
,Crillie,2007-11-28T19:52Z,"Jan-Bertil, det är exakt samma. Vad är problemet mer exakt?"
,Jan-Bertil,2007-11-28T20:48Z,"Spelet vägrar starta. När jag exekverar den crackade 'Launch.exe' blir skärmen svart, som om spelet tänker dra igång. Därefter kommer bara rutan ""kane&lynch.exe har stött på ett problem & måste avslutas"" upp. Jag har uppdaterat drivrutiner till såväl ljud som grafikkort, ominstallerat spelet, dragit ned/upp ljudaccelerationen, laddat hem cracken flera gånger, & installerat spelet på olika diskar/partitioner - ändå vägrar det starta! I spelets readme-fil räknas de kort upp, som spelet stödjer. I princip alla nVidia kort finns uppräknade, UTOM mitt Gf6800. Men eftersom exempelvis Gf6600 finns med, borde väl även mitt kort funka eller? Jag ger snart upp, & beställer ett X1950Pro500Mb. Kan du på något sätt tipsa, eller komma på någon lösning? Tack för visat intresse, Crillie!"

,blemishednicely,2007-12-06T05:30Z,"Are you sure there's a virus? very uncommon w/ torrents...if that's a mistake, PLEASE keep seeding---I'm just under 80% and would hate to have waited for nothing! PLEASE DON""T STOP SEEDING YET! I'll keep it seeded for quite a while after ( assuming it works/I can get it running) I've finished....PLEASE!!!!"
,blemishednicely,2007-12-06T05:33Z,"Like, the torrent shows seeders dropping from about 150 down to 25...I'll seriously keep it for a week, maybe even 2 weeks, just as long as I get it! 
-State of Mild/Elevated Panic-"
,blemishednicely,2007-12-07T01:56Z,"Sweet! Got it DL'd now, though I haven't started unpacking it yet to see if it works for me, but I'm seeding anyway and will do so for about two weeks unless I encounter a massive error trying to run it. Just too big too keep on my laptop if it isn't useful to me...though I don't expect that to happen. For AFTER my 2week seeding spree, I'd like to know if there's any particular trick to moving this to a disk...a typical data disk holds app. 7,500MB, but this file with all its parts ranges over 10,000(roughly), so my basic question--to HATRED the man himself, but any advice is good--How do I transfer this to disk, while keeping it operational? can I just throw everything in order, as much as will fit on one, the rest on the other? Do certain groupings HAVE 
to stay together in order to function? Would there be any problem in burning EXACTLY half on each disk? I WILL keep the seed for 2 weeks, as promised...but eventually I WILL need to know this (like I said I am 50%cursed/blessed by having dildo-licking laptop-handy, but fuck-all for 
storage capability!) Any help here would be VERY 
useful to me...."
,blemishednicely,2007-12-07T07:58Z,"I don't know if anybody else has had a ""read error"", 
but apparently WinRar can't unpack it (fucks up 100%), and isobuster can't seem to do it...how the hell do you open this?"
,blemishednicely,2007-12-07T08:27Z,"'kay I hate to be a bitch but I can't get this slut to work! I've tried everything...all I can check out is the info file which gives a (detailed, I admit) description of the game's premise, but NOTHING else works!!! I get to 3% (unpacking), and then it ALWAYS throws up some horseshit about a read error on ""...htd-kldm.r01"", as WELL as a data error: ""cyclic redundancy check"" or some fuckin' thing! I've tried rar/zip/archiving/iso (actually GOT to the ISO tile for ""htd-kldm.r00"", but IT did fuck-all, too), I even tried Daemon! Admittedly I'm a noob at this, and NEARLY every time I try to use .rar I get fucked up the ass w/ Salt&Vin. chips...but the info only gives a (rather optimistic I'd say-no offence, hatred) 1/2/3 installation guide that doesn't even come close to explaining MY issue. Any advice? I'm not hacking on YOU, I just really fucking hate .rar & dunno WTF I'm doing wrong here...I'll have to fix it or dump it, I'm afraid..."
,blemishednicely,2007-12-07T08:29Z,"-Sorry, I'm an asshole...I thought YOUR name was hatred...just noticed the HWiZaRd bit, but I never said I was smart. Apologies, but I still need help, dude! Sorry, again..."
,blackfire117,2007-12-07T22:41Z,"om det nu är precis samma, så kan man ju ladda ner från den andra, som är precis likadan: 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3897074/Kane_and_Lynch_Dead_Men-HATRED
Éftersom att det är fleer seeders... sorry HWiZaRd, men den borde ju vara snabbare att ladda ner.. :/"
,blemishednicely,2007-12-08T05:07Z,"sorry i wasted all the room...still no results/advice, so I'm dumping it & looking for another version...if you figure out what I missed, and people are still seeding I'll try again if I have 0 luck elsewhere, but I don't have the space to do both, sorry hwizard."

Skärmen blir svart precis som att spelet precis ska gå igång... men då kommer det upp ett felmeddelande där det står ""kaneandlynch.exe har stött på ett problem och måste avslutas..."" Någon som vet hur man ska göra för att fixa de??? "
,marshmallow,2007-12-18T12:15Z,"With windows XP it's common that the game just crashes after the screen have went black. I'm afraid there is no work around at the moment, probably will be fixed with a new patch.
Just wait until it come. 
My game crashes also :/ , so you ain't alone ;)"
,sparkey-b,2008-01-02T12:55Z,"Hey guys/gals , It works for me:

XP Pro, ASUS A8N-SLI mobo, 2 x Nvidia 7800GTX (running SLI), 2gb RAM

I un-rared the files using WINRAR then mounted using Alc120% - installed then copied over the crack from the HATRED folder.

All seems to work fine except for the speech - very intermittant - other sounds working fine....

Any ideas ??"
,sparkey-b,2008-01-02T20:43Z,"Sorry - forgot to add - both Video cards 256mb, processor dual AMD Athlon 4200 x64"
,metal_head81,2008-01-06T00:22Z,"yeah i keep getting the same read error as everybody else.saying i dont have enough disk space which is bullshit cuz as of right now,on the disk im trying to unpack it to has roughly 116GB.and i checked the requirements and i blow em away,so i know it aint my computer.im running xp pro w/ intel core 2 extreme 3.0ghz,3 GB of pc 1200mhz ram,an nvidia geforce 7950gt on an evga 680 i sli mobo.so id say this torrent is fucked up for sure.that or you need something else to unpack the motherfucker"
,fisrulloman,2008-01-06T12:18Z,"Have the same problem with crash on launch.
Used the other torrent (the one with A LOT of seeders)

SysSpecs: core2 duo, 8800gts, 2gb ddr2

probably Bono (owns Eidos) who buttfucked IO Interactive so they'd ""finish"" the game before christmas - hope a patch will fix it."
,Ricer8,2008-01-12T13:20Z,"Hey guyz, this game works fine for me. Frickin' cool but anyway... i had the same problem like sparkey-b. The sound was fucked up. to arrange this follow these steps: 

1-Click start.
2-Click on ""Run.""
3-Type ""dxdiag"" and enter.
4-Go to sound.
5-Move the slider to the left until it comes to second option (basic acceleration).

Then in the in-game menu go on ""options"", ""audio"" and switch to generic hardware. That should do the trick.

Regards,
RICER"
,zArL,2008-01-17T21:37Z,I got no sound =/ and when i try to do like ricer8 is saying the game don't start =/  works perfect otherwise
,kiptanoi,2008-01-22T13:25Z,"Till alla som får en svart ruta och en krach vid början av start av spelet så kommer en komment av samma fel från en annan sida, jag testade det och har nu även jag fått igång spelet: 

""Hi all, i will let where the link where do you have to download a fix to not crash .

Patch for LIVE fixed all my crashes.... http://www.gamesforwindows.com/en-US/Support/live/Pages/default.aspx
