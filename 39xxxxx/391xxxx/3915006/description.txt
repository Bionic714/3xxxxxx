Hey guys first seed. I got Fallout 2 through this community and loved it some much I bought all three fallout games on one DVD. Here it is as an ISO, just mount it with Daemon Tools. Bonus includes manuals and some other stuff I haven't checked out yet. I can only seed for about a week so get on it!
