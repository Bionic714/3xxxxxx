The only thing missing is the ability to patch/keygen DVD Architect Pro 4.5"
,red96ta,2007-12-04T08:05Z,"Works fine, but no ac3, mpg1, or mpg2 render options....not a rookie here either, been using Vegas since V.4  Unlike other V.8's out there, this one includes all the effects and transitions....no rendering to mpg2 or ac3 (needed for dvd output in dvd-lab).  If I'm missin' something here, feel free to correct me....installed and cracked properly."
,bullshitproductions,2007-12-13T14:37Z,"Hey could you help me? I downloaded Sony Vegas 8.0 from the pirate bay and installed it. There was crack included so I installed it too. Everything went well. I started the program and it worked. But when i tried to load my project i realized that there are no video fxs and transitions in this program. Will this patch and keygen help? If not what else can I do?? I need help, because i must hurry with my project. PLZ HELP ME!!!!thx"

Thanks in advance"
,JedidiahCrane,2008-02-18T18:05Z,"Maybe you should read the patch notes, where it says they embed a trojan in every release that sends your comp info the FBI to see if anyone pays attention to the patch notes.  Cute!"
,Lirid4wn,2008-04-16T22:16Z,"Anyone who could help me with the Key? I can't get it to work, it just says it's wrong all the time. Please, help is needed!"
,Lirid4wn,2008-04-16T22:18Z,"It says "" An error has occured while patching"" each time i try to patch ._."
,sgr1rts,2008-04-24T23:44Z,"I am having the same issue as Lirid4wn is having. I get "" An error has occured while patching"" and I've tried everything I know, any suggestions?"

,CODILICIOUS,2008-07-10T23:15Z,I did everything right but it says my Authentication Code on the Sony Vegas Pro 8.0 is not correct. Any Suggestions?
,nymfomaniac,2008-07-24T12:08Z,Hey i have patched and use keygen and all works great but i cant import any mpeg files and that is the kind of file type my sony handcam use. what should i do? can i download a codec for this software?
,M_I_K_E,2008-09-08T14:47Z,"rightclick the keygen and select ""run as administrator"" if you're using Vista.
Then make sure to patch the Sony PROGRAM FILE, not the default download directory it gives you."

OMG!!! Caustic Window!!!!

As for everyone looking for places to download the programs, google it.  There are tons of places to get the trials for them, then just simply keygen-patch it.  That's the way I got Vegas."
,poutamitts,2010-03-08T16:17Z,"Quick overview of installation instructions:

*Run setup file
*DO NOT run the app once it's installed
*Run keygen AS ADMINISTRATOR (by right-clicking on file)
*Patch
*Run product and paste key
*Choose to register in another PC
*Paste activation code
Done!

By running the keygen as admin i got rid of the ""An error occurred while trying to patch file"" message and was able to install it and crack it properly.

Hope it helps."
