The Violin Player was the first techno/pop album by classical and pop musician Vanessa-Mae, released in 1995 (see 1995 in music). It is also the first album Vanessa-Mae released on the EMI label.
The Violin Player has a unique blend of music â?? covers of some classical (J.S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor), remakes of old favorites (Mason Williams' "Classical Gas") and originals (seven tracks composed by British musician and songwriter Mike Batt), and one original by Vanessa-Mae herself with co-writing of Ian Wherry (Red Hot).
The Violin Player has sold over 8 million copies, and is still regarded by many as Vanessa-Mae's best work.
