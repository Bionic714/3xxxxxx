What a long and sad road these songs have traveled.
They are parts from what was a full lenght record. it moved from a couple different labels. Eventually to land no where. So we made this Ep out of my favorite parts. the whole album (without the remix's) can be found on soulseek. To think this is the sound of Pandatone betweem "Lemons & Limes" & Happy Together" is almost odd. "Wondering" in various forms made it's way from texas to Tokyo on various compilations. here Praveen Sharma gives us possibly the best version yet. Tonetraeger (Hauschka & TG Mauss) applies their leftfield pop sense to "Only to Sleep In", making it a more minimal and disjointed pop effort. And Two Piece gives us a lovely guest appernce by MacDonald Duck Eclairs "Micihi". The Video below was created by Ilan Katin, and was going to also be on the original album. lot's of people put a lot of work into this now free release. please enjoy it.
