,overlydiatonic,2007-12-06T15:29Z,"Yes. That's because these files are in FLAC format, which preserves perfect CD quality (as opposed to MP3 which throws away information it thinks you're less likely to hear).

See http://flac.sourceforge.net/

If you compare this to .WAV, it's just over half as big.

If that's still too big for you, try my Ogg upload. Ogg Vorbis is a format similar to MP3 but higher quality."
,umamylove,2007-12-08T01:16Z,"ouch! Thank you overlydiatonic.
I got it in mp3 but I think i'll download it...
Does it goes on with iTunes or not ? 
and do you know where I can get all the ""Over the Edge"" Lp's??? here's a link to a torrent of a big negativland discography, but it came from Demonoid and this site seems closed now...
