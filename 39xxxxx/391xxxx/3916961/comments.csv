And, does anyone have artwork for it?  I'd love to have a hi-rez scan of the original VHS box."

Saw this movie when I was really little and almost thought I was dreaming it up because no one else seemed to remember it.....hey...what's that movie with the buffalo??? Nothing Nothing.....finally I figured it out thanks to yahoo answers and youtube.  Then, it's only on VHS and it's rare...so here I am!  Thanks for this!  Looking forward to watching it!"
