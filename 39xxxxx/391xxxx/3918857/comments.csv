It's really a great CD for Hip Hop fans, Canadian Heads, people curious about the situation in Somalia, Fans of Music period etc. etc... I've bought music online once before and am increasingly interested in paying for music from Indie artists or lesser known artists I want to support. The other CD I bought was from a local band who I'd seen live a pile of times, I ordered it from a lesser known company linked from the band's website. The file came in Rare format and had the album art/tracklist/other BS included, cost me about 20 bucks, but more importantly HAD NO STRINGS. It was plain old Mp3 format, beautiful.

All that being said, the ITunes M4P format can suck my dick. I appreciate the 9.99$ price point for an album but limiting my use of said music to 5 computers that MUST HAVE iTunes installed is fuckin whack. I'll continue to re-download every song I buy from iTunes from other sources(like pirate bay), burn CD's and turn my friends on to the shit I listen too... and you know what? I don't feel at all guilty about it. iTunes needs to change their policy because it sure isn't stopping ""piracy"". Fuckers.

Sorry for the rant. "

2.) burn to a cd
3.) rip said cd to mp3 (can be done with itunes even)
4.) ???
5.) Profit."
,Hubird,2008-09-13T19:40Z,"m0rn1ng5t4r your advice is worthless, get a clue before you give advice.... If you do what you said you will end up with very bad quality files.  Both mp3 and mp4 formats are lossy (you lose quality and can never get it back).

You should NEVER re-encode lossy files."
,Slowmoe,2008-10-25T20:04Z,"Hey guys speaking of quality, when I ripped this I conformed it to Uberstandard. Pretty much it is a way of encoding MP3's with the best quality in mind."
