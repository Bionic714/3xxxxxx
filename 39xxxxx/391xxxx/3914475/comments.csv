,DoubleAught,2007-12-02T06:30Z," Don't leave us yet, Roderick!  No one's gotten a full copy yet...  thanks!"
,RoderickSpode,2007-12-03T16:57Z,"Okay, my network went down for a bit on Friday and although Transmission shows the torrents as available for uploading, they don't seem to be reactivated, they're stalled.  Any idea how I make them start working again, short of going through the whole upload process again?  (Using Transmission 0.94 and a Mac with Leopard, DSL connection.)  Thanks--"
,RoderickSpode,2007-12-04T06:45Z,"Never mind, it finally came back to life after 4 days.  Maybe all the downloaders were successfully downloading from someone else in the interim.  I'll try to keep it open from now on..."
