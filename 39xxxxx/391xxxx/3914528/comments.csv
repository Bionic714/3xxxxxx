,fuckslatina,2007-12-03T03:35Z,"Deathchaoz: This DVD is the Latin American edition of the movie. It does NOT contain the DTS audio track that will be available on US-released DVDs (scheduled for release on Dec. 18th). 

Region? It was originally labeled as both Region 1 and Region 4, but now it is region-free ;-)"
