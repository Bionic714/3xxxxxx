Music of Quality and Distinction..this was an album made up of covers by artists such as Paula Yates(These Boots Are Made For Walking),Tina Turner,Gary Glitter etc and produced by the Heaven 17 guys..been looking for ages everywhere,but no joy !
Cheers"

Cheers"

I appreciate this awesome collection.. Keep it coming."

You don't happen to have Foxx's Metamatic, do you?"
,Iceman00769,2009-03-26T06:55Z,"In referance to the person who asked for Music of Quality and Distinction.  That would be the group B.E.F.  aka British Electric Foundation, produced by the Heaven 17 guys..made up of covers by guest vocalists such as Paula Yates(These Boots Are Made For Walking),Tina Turner,Gary Glitter etc.
They actually made two albums.  I have both.  As soon as I can figure out how to add to torrent and upload I will.  Stay tuned."
