:. about .:

As the Allied forces broke out of the Normandy beaches and the battle for France began, American tank crews soon came to realize what they were up against.

To their dismay and horror, the American Sherman tank-crews quickly 
found out how inadequate and inferior their tanks were, especially against 
Germany's late model tanks. 

They were drastically out-gunned and out-armored by the far superior German tanks. On the other hand, the American tanks were faster,more maneuverable and far more reliable. The Allies had a greater number of tanks, very effective artillery and total are superiority. German columns were constantly harassed from the air as American Thunderbolts and British Typhoons rained horror upon them.

S p e c i a l   I n f o   N o t e :

Some virus-scanner recognize the header of a packed exe 

( _PanzKill.exe )

as a lame virus, (coz its the byte by byte check error of em!.) 

Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics
