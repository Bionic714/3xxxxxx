,togo,2007-12-07T12:32Z,"I quite liked this movie. Its filmed a bit like Sin City or A Scanner Darkly with computer animation laid over live actors. Beowulf the legend is one of the oldest stories in European folklore. Its not a modern tale so do not expect a complex script, think more old school tale of morals, with a hard bastard of a Viking as the hero. And by the way, a decent copy can be found here:

,Quirky_Puppy,2007-12-08T21:00Z,"@thecloudking & thisme & sweet1970 (although I suspect you're all the same pointless wanker who uploaded this film by different names)

You don't know who the people commenting are. You don't know if they upload. They have not just a right, but an obligation to comment on this!

I'm not going to download this because of the comments on the quality, and I'd advise others to do the same. 

Yes he's uploaded a movie, but it'd have been better for all if he hadn't bothered, he's apparently not contributed anything to the scene but wasting other peoples time and bandwidth. "
