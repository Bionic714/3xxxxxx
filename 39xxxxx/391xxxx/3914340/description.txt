The Verve (originally Verve) are an English alternative rock band formed in Wigan, Greater Manchester in 1989 at Winstanley Sixth Form College, by vocalist Richard Ashcroft, guitarist Nick McCabe, bassist Simon Jones, and drummer Peter Salisbury. Simon Tong later became a member. The band split in April 1999 due to inner conflicts which led to McCabe's departure. They reunited in June 2007. The band has announced an album due at unspecified date in 2008 and a tour scheduled for November & December 2007.

Urban Hymns is the highly acclaimed alternative rock/space rock album released on September 29, 1997 by English rock band The Verve. After the release of the band's previous album, A Northern Soul, The Verve broke up due to growing tensions between Richard Ashcroft and Nick McCabe. They reunited in 1996 (see 1996 in music) and recorded Urban Hymns, which earned nearly unanimous critical praise upon its release and went on to become one of the biggest selling albums of the year largely on the strength of the international chart-topper Bitter Sweet Symphony.
