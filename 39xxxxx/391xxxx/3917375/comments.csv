,Duncan_is,2009-01-27T06:47Z,"It's clean, I had issues with the installer. I just adjusted it for compatibility with windows 98* (even though I have XP) and the installer worked fine! FYI This is one of the best music managers/players I have ever used....    *(Install file: right click properties, compatibility tab)"
