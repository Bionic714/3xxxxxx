,marcus_ivo,2007-12-12T02:49Z,haha I'm glad this features none of that
,bigtrucks,2007-12-19T13:53Z,"These are great man, keep it up!"
,Lanfear,2007-12-28T10:37Z,"I'm addicted to these. It took a week. Can't resist... keep'em coming!

Seeding to ratio of 2 or more, for my fellow addicts.

Britney and Kylie albums weren't that bad though, but latest Caribou album is slightly better!       ;-)"
,badlands,2008-01-18T18:39Z,"No, what makes Shankly unique is him speaking about himself in third person singular. Signs of mental illness should be treated at an early stage as well as Megalomania. ""Musical wisdom"", my ass - a lot of self-admiring as well as the misspelling of Morten Harket. The biggest yawn of 2007."
