 
With new releases from Kylie, Girls Aloud, Britney, Morten Harkett and Cliff, what a month November was for music!!! And Shankly has the best of it. Surprisingly none of those artists feature on the mixtapes - Shankly in his musical wisdom prefering Froggystein, the Immovable Objects, A Challenge Of Honour and World's End Girlfriend instead - but perhaps that's what makes Shankly unique! 

Look out for loads of uploads during December featuring Shankly's end-of-year choices. You won't be disappointed!
