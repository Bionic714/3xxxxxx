What converter do you use to make your stuff the MP4 format....I have been trying to find a good one and am yet to come across it.  I see you are somewhat of a guru of the MP4 collection and would love to help upload and seed.  Anyway, keep up the great work.  I know this isn't your most recent post, but it is your most seeded.  Anyway, I will post on a couple more but I hope you respond on this one so I don't have to go digging for your answer, or you can e-mail me at Ttownmiked@aol.com  Thanks again man"

,awesomekirstin,2008-06-24T20:10Z,"How to get .mp4 to play on PSP:

make sure you have a memory card!

Rename the files as M4V0000xx ((XX being the movie number such as 1 2 3 ect))

create a folder named MP_ROOT

Put all movies in x:\\MP_ROOT\100MNV01 (X being the drive your memory card is located)


(((there are programs you can download online to rename the file, just search google or here)))"
