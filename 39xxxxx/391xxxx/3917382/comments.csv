Just want to fill you in on why I boosted this.

It started out that I was going to get Johnny Cash and found a torrent, Started downloading
It keep comeing up with hash errors from more and more people, (or Bots?) and was takeing forever to come in, after a week I decided to see if someone else had it, and someone did.
so I got it.  After A while I noticed that there were alot of hash errors on this one too.

after closer examination I seen what was happenning. Both torrents was downloading to the same diretory and to the same file names,but was not the exact file just close. which was trashing the files. this could have been the reason I was receiving bad seeds. others have both running.

I finaly stoped both torrents deleted the directory
started the second one again (which had more seeds).

After Finally getting this finished I wonted to preserve this data so I changed the torrent to stop the overwrite, to use pirate tracker
and a constant bit rate (Half the size)."
