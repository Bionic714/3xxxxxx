,PHBFO,2007-12-01T14:16Z,Can someone confirm it works? That it works for me doesn't mean that it works for everyone offcourse.
,BlackBug,2007-12-01T15:08Z,Sweet man. Absolutely sweet. Thanx a lot mate. Will let you know as soon as I am done. (Although I am pretty sure it will work !)
,PHBFO,2007-12-01T16:54Z,"Thank you. Everyone, make sure you follow the crack instructions step by step, otherwise it will go wrong!"
[T],supaturtle,2007-12-01T20:15Z,"many thanks, works brilliant here ;)"
,DDeuce,2007-12-02T01:07Z,Crack still does not work as of 12012007 2107zulu
,BlackBug,2007-12-02T12:55Z,WORKS !!! PERFECT !!! THANX !!!
,DeakStarwalker,2007-12-02T14:29Z,How you open you canopy?
,PHBFO,2007-12-02T16:59Z,Shift+E
,PHBFO,2007-12-02T22:28Z,"*NOTE*
After installing the Phantom, copy the bglman files (v.028) and save them! Everytime you install a product from the C9 site, use this older bglman!! This one will work with the crack, the new ones don't!!!!"
,gianluk81,2007-12-03T16:30Z,"Hi, this crack not work for me with Bergen Scenery...i tried to install with bglman 1.28 but the esellerate fake not run...run the normal esellerate page for buy! With Phantom work fine! Any idea for solution?! Any idea for Zurich by FSDreamTeam!?"
,PHBFO,2007-12-03T21:28Z,"The bglman files installed with the Phantom (that works with the crack) are for FS9 only, cause the phantom isn't for FSuX. Sorry, I don't now about Zurich."
,b2bp2p,2007-12-03T22:25Z,I'm fed up with warnings of TRJ in the dll files...so no more F-4 for me.. bahhh
,gianluk81,2007-12-03T22:29Z,PHBFO: You confirm the Bergen scenery not work in FS9 with bglman.dll v.028? Why???
,PHBFO,2007-12-03T22:55Z,"Oops sorry, my bad! The FS9 version should work with this crack. Install Bergen, copy the 028 bglman to your modules (overwrite the 042) and install the crack.That should do the trick!"
,gianluk81,2007-12-04T01:22Z,don't work :(
,PHBFO,2007-12-07T19:30Z,The phantom or bergen?
,bass13,2007-12-07T20:01Z,"Thank you very much PHBFO... it works perfect for me! I downloaded and installed every single addons for FS9 and they're working like a charm... except ""Bergen"". It seems to me that version 028 doesn't supported it. Bergen doesn't appear in the activation list under the Addon Manager tab... at least in my system."
,gianluk81,2007-12-08T16:52Z,i have the same problem
,PHBFO,2007-12-08T18:08Z,"Aight everyone, update:

This BGLMAN and Crack works with every addon from Cloud9, except the newest scenery's like bergen. For those you must have newer bglman's wich don't work with the crack. The phantom, KLAX, DCA etc. work like a charm!"
,expextremist,2007-12-09T23:29Z,"hi there... thanks for the great aircraft and naturally, the crack to go with it 

:-D

quick problem.... no textures, on any of the phantoms??

anybody with any ideas as to why??? everything installed as per the readmes... so why the texture issues?"
,expextremist,2007-12-09T23:33Z,"nvm... just needed to wipe the phantom out my eyes and read the information avaliable.

silly me...


carry on, mens!"
,PHBFO,2007-12-10T22:48Z,"Ghehe no problem! As I said, the textures are available at the cloud9 site."

,djay72,2008-02-22T22:40Z,"I must have really done something wrong...I still get the Purchase box?  I removed all old Cloud9 sceneries, (EHAM)..then did all in the crack readme...Installed the phantom...then the crack..then SP3.  Do I crack it before SP3?  someone please help...."
,Baster23,2008-03-23T14:31Z,"work perfekt with the cloud9 phantom !!!

THX ;o)"
,GoldenScimitar,2008-05-07T04:09Z,"The real problem is this:

There are no complete Cloud9 or FSDreamTeam downloads in TPB under the same BGLMan crack. So basically, even if I install 2 sceneries from Cloud9 that are under the same BGLMan, if I tried to install another Cloud9 airport available from TPB with a different BGLMan version, then that particular one will work, but the other cracks will be overwritten, making it hard to complete a full Cloud9 collection.

My request is, ALL Cloud9 sceneries under the SAME BGLMan crack. Please respond back to this. Thanks."
