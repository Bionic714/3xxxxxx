Cloud9 F-4 Phantom for FS2004                      -       November 2007


Right after the new crack came online, I downloaded it and installed the Phantom. However, it now seems that Cloud9 has updated their installers so that the new crack doesn't work!

But, I've managed to safe the Phantom! Here are the basepack that works with the new crack.

Included:

Basepack 1.02
Service Pack 1.03
Crack

The liveries are available at their website.

Enjoy!
