Description: this is somebody else's rip of the 1987 movie starring Dan Ankroyd and Tom Hanks. The rip is a good one, so I didn't have to bother making my own rip. The movie is an excellent comedy that I think should or will become a classic. The funniest part is the phrase that Joe Friday (Ankroyd) uses in place of his love interest's name when he introduces her. I don't want to spoil it if you haven't seen it, download it, rent it, buy it because just that one line is worth the price.
It took a while to download and I've kept it in my hard drive for seeding, but the seeding has been dissapointing. The title had the rip name of 'spencer' on it.
Anyway, I've created this new torrent for it under my ripper name (RUBrTOE). I'm hoping that downloaders reconize a RUBrTOE file as always being the best available quality rip and therefore downloaders will get it  it and help seed it some more. This rip passes my quality standard for my own rips.


IMDB sucks. Rather, if anybody wants to know what a movie is about, he/she should see if there is a Wikipedia article for the movie. There is a good Wikipedia article for this movie and I highly recommend it much more than the movie's IMDB page:
