Things were really hotting up with the BBC agreeing to an extension to the 30 minute episodes, they could now run to 50 minutes. This gave Sullivan time to really dwell on the great plotlines and characters. It really worked.

One of the main additions was the Trotter family had now gained the female partners, this led to even more hilarious outcomes and a depth that breathed new life into the sitcom. Outstanding episodes include Yuppy Love, where Rodney firsy meets Cassandra and Chain Gang, a great plot that involves the majority of the cast.

Episodes.9.Robin Flies a Dawn

Brief: Del and Rodney along with Albert in a 15 mins special, encourage the troops out in the Gulf war that they have a Top Secret plan in the form of a disguised 3 wheeler tank (the van). Also not to worry cos Del will look after there birds until they get back.

Del, Rodney and Albert produced this special to boost the morale of the troops in the Gulf. For a while this one was lost, but The appreciation Society uncovered it and brought it back for the public. Great lines include "This is Derek Trotter reporting from a secret location somewhere in southern England.", then Rodney says "(To Del) It's High Wycombe." This is unlikely to be released for public viewing, but the script is availble.
