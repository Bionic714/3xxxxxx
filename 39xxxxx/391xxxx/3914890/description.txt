Aidan & Trimble's "Karate Kata and Applications Volume 3".

This is an essential reference book to any serious karate-ka.  I have uploaded this and volume 4 because I found it very difficult to obtain them myself as they are out of print.  Please support the authors by buying Volumes 1 & 2 which are freely available in all good book stores.

Enjoy.
