,pegbundy,2009-01-24T19:46Z,OK. By the size of this download I can only assume that it is in a book form and no style of Karate mention. So I am assuming that it is Shotokan. Is that right?
,nualphaman4,2010-08-21T08:14Z,"Yes, this is a pdf of the book. Although I am not a Shotokan stylist, think of Shotokan as a base style or allow it to take the place of Karate as Kung Fu takes the place of Shoalin, Hung Gar or Wing Tsun. Many of the first few kata's (pinan) are the same or similar in the top 5 ""karate"" styles i.e. Uichi Ryu, Goju Ryu, Shito Ryu, Isshin Ryu and Shito Ryu. Please do not allow this to fool you into believing that they are the same thing. They are not. It doesn't matter if you are a traditionalist or not, one should pay particular attention to the link between the styles and the philosophy behind the movements. There is a real fighting purpose behind them. It just takes a really long time to see it. "
,nualphaman4,2010-08-21T08:22Z,"Sorry about that, I mentioned Shito Ryu twice. I meant to add Shorei Ryu. Tied with it, one might want to add Shorin Ryu to the mix. Shorei is made for stronger bigger fighters and Shorin for smaller lighter fighters. The analogous Chinese comparison would be, in the north you have more kicking oriented styles as exampled with the Crane and in the south more hands like praying mantis, wing tsun, tiger or hung gar. The north has more open areas and the south less. The closer you get to Korea there is more emphasis on kicking and the closer get to boats or the south, more punching and trapping hands. This of course s a over simplification but never the less pretty accurate."
