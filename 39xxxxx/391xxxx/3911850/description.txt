Hey all, this is my guide to downloading GH3 for ps2. Honestly, I'm sick of waiting to see it in stock in stores. So here we go.

YOU WILL NEED:
A fat ps2 that is modded, or just a fat ps2 with swapmagic (found here:

Most likely the guitar hero 2 controller considering it's better and easier

Apache 2 found here:

DVD DECRYPTER Found here:

SONY DVD+R Discs as sony is the BEST.

A dvd burner on your computer

Some kick ass rock to occupy your time for the 5-20 minutes when it's downloading to the disc, I used avenged sevenfold.


STEP 1. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A MODDED PS2 OR THE SWAPMAGIC THIS WILL HELP YOUR PS2 RUN BURNED DISCS.

STEP 2. Download the file, AND SEED WHEN FINISHED.

STEP 3. Put the file in apache to make sure it checks out.

STEP 4. Go to dvd decrypter, press the folder to open it into dvd decrypter, then go down to write speed, set it to 4x, and click the "verify" box. Then click the little "hard drive picture > cd picture" and turn on your rock.

STEP 5. When finished the disc should automatically pop out, you may get an error on the screen but its fine. Just x it out.

STEP 6. YOU HAVE GUITAR HERO 3. NOW TIME TO ROCK OUT.
