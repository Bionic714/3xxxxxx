,Spetsnaz420,2007-11-29T02:28Z,NTSC or PAL?
,Arcon-death,2007-11-29T14:42Z,"Spet: It wont matter, most decent mod-chips and swapmagic have both support"
,Zephyr618,2007-12-02T17:24Z,"I don't want to spend money on a modchip, so what is swapmagic?"
,brucelee93,2007-12-02T23:38Z,um yeah modded slim ps2's work too.
,fenipa,2007-12-03T22:42Z,PAL or NTSC?
,zackey,2008-05-14T20:41Z,How do i seed with azereus?
,DarkFireTheReal,2008-05-26T12:50Z,Hey can people PLZ seed we are dieing from waiting out here. i have not had a single byte of download from anyone
,DarkFireTheReal,2008-05-26T13:03Z,"To clear up the questions on the comment so that DeathStrike209 doesn't have to waste his time:
1)Swap magic costs the same as a mod Chip (i have it) 2) i does not matter weather it is pal or NTSC because u will need a mod chip or some thing similar to play it anyway and they all play both. 3) most bit torrent programs seed automatically if not right click and click start.                              SEED PLZ"
