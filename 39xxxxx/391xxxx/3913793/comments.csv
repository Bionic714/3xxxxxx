i guess the band plays some music they didnt have the rights to so they had to cut that part out."
,BrookesDad,2007-11-29T08:20Z,what sucks is they only did 2 seasons. this was an awesome show

,Shakabon,2007-11-30T03:41Z,"ha!
Was looking for this for quite a while :))"
,crunkest,2008-01-16T05:35Z,this makes a nice replacement for the VHS tapes i bought a thousand years ago and can't play anymore (though I hope they didn't edit out the motorhead or madness).  thanks!

,Xeokym,2008-06-11T14:44Z,"yay! I'm replacing my old worn out VHS episodes, too. What a pity the show only went 2 seasons!! This is one of those series I'm just aching for more episodes but I know I'll never get them. I wouldn't want to see the guys doing it now when they're OLD, anyway. Oh well, gotta live with the reruns..."
