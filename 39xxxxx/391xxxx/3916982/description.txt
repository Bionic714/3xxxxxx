IMDB sucks. Rather, if anybody wants to know what a movie is about, he/she should see if there is a Wikipedia article for the movie. 
There is a good Wikipedia article for this movie and I highly recommend it much more than the movie's IMDB page.

This quirky movie stars Bill Murray, aging hotties Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange along with young hottie Alexis Dziena   who goes full frontal in this movie.
