,SecrecY33,2008-11-30T06:49Z,"Finally! i'm done. i'll be seeding for a while.  it downloaded good but there wasn't a key. If you need a key go to www.serials.ws and in the search bar type in harry potter. find what your looking for, under Serials, and click it. I think it needs a Crack though.. Good luck.

,SecrecY33,2008-11-30T07:23Z,"Alright yep, needed a crack. works fine now ;)

Now, for the Crack:

Go to www.gamecopyworld.com

search harry potter, find harry potter order of...
if you just type in harry potter it should be the first link. well click the order of the phoenex one and click on the FIX EXE one. download this and you'll have a file called hp.exe from it. copy that, open harry potter's file location, paste it there. copy and replace THAT hp. after all of that, it should work. 
Again, good luck!"
