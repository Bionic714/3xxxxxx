,loveysgirl34,2007-12-02T22:59Z,Can someone please seed this...i want to watch some of these with my kids.  Thank you.
,Paullie77,2007-12-04T01:00Z,where are the seeds at
,ltrtiger,2007-12-04T15:20Z,Can we get some seeds for this one.....please?
,ltrtiger,2007-12-05T23:11Z,"Come on seeders....where's the Christmas spirit?  At this rate, we might have a complete copy by NEXT Christmas.  SEED PLEASE."
,fraynes1,2007-12-07T23:24Z,Will we actually get this before Christmas 2007!!  Someone please seed.  Nice up just not going very fast!!
,ltrtiger,2007-12-08T03:06Z,"At this rate, it's doubtful that we'll get this before Christmas.  Appreciate the effort, but without seeds, what's the point?  "
,slagger,2007-12-08T08:50Z,"It's only the 8th, chill. Check your peer lists, over 120 people have over 50% after one week."
,fraynes1,2007-12-08T19:53Z,"What rate are you uploading at?  You maybe shouldn't be uploading if on dialup a file this size.  Like I stated before very nice up, but extremely slow speed.  A week for 50% isn't really acceptable speed. "
,slagger,2007-12-09T05:40Z,"I know it's slower than desired; I'm on DSL not dialup.  I do apologize that it's taking so long.  I've sent out 15.1GB as of now.  I do believe there will be enough seeds in time for a lot of people to have this in time for christmas, assuming they all keep it open.  It's at 36kb/s.    Any tips for making it go out faster?  Maximum number of connected peers per torrent is set to 95; will it go faster if I drop that number down?  I had it add 300 before.  Up speed is of course set to unlimited, and I am using Âľtorrent."
,slagger,2007-12-09T05:45Z,Forgot to mention--this is the only torrent I have running
,revcog,2007-12-11T01:20Z,I've never downloaded an .iso file before. What do you guys do with it once it's downloaded? Burn it directly to a dvd? unzip it like an .rar or convert it to something else like .wmv? Thanks slagger for posting these shows.
,slagger,2007-12-12T00:39Z,"Revcog: Yes, burn it to a DVD using a program such as Imgburn http://www.imgburn.com
If you only want to watch it on your computer you can mount the file as a virtual drive, such as with Daemon Tools http://www.daemon-tools.cc/
You're very welcome."
,revcog,2007-12-12T19:10Z,"Hey Slagger, imgburn worked great! 
I have 100% of this download now, I'll seed for a few days. Thanks again"
,slagger,2007-12-13T00:11Z,"Glad that worked for you revcog!
This page is showing 125 seeders!  ltrtiger I hope one is you :)"
,jollyroger1847,2007-12-14T05:10Z,"Why not make it as AVI files, or something easier to deal with for people that don't want to make a DVD?"
,jollyroger1847,2007-12-14T05:14Z,"Thanks for postin, btw...don't wanna sound like I'm complaining"
,slagger,2007-12-14T05:37Z,"well i downloaded all of the videos right here last month actually, I figured anybody who wants that could do the same...but they seem to have disappeared now for some reason.  (except the twilight zone episode, that is in the collection of all 156 episodes--by the way, for Honeymooners fans, the main character in that one is played by Art Carney!)  Annoying, because I accidentally erased the original files from my 2nd hard drive with system restore! So this is all I have left.  

Anyway, I turned them into a DVD for a present and I thought maybe some other people would like this, esp. since it took me a long time looking for a really good freeware DVD authoring program (I used DVDforge, for anyone who's interested), and then getting it just right with the menu and everything.

Again, I would like to thank everybody who's seeding this now that it's finally all up.  I'll keep it running at least until the 27th for anybody still trying to get a copy, but as mentioned my internet connection is kind of shit so if others could do something similar I'm sure it would be appreciated."
,bigfitswell,2007-12-16T03:40Z,After 4days I can tell that I won't be getting this by Christmas. With 60 seeders why is my avg DL rate is 2.0kbs
,slagger,2007-12-19T02:33Z,"Now thats a good question, I couldn't tell you what would cause that"
,1509,2007-12-24T01:39Z,"sounds like a great torrent, seed though!  I am getting a good amount of seeders but bad download speeds!"
