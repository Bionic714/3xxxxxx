Total control over your mac\'s webcam

Adjust and manipulate your webcam\'s video settings from within iChat AV and many other programs, including iMovie, Photo Booth, Yahoo! Messenger, Skype and web-based chat. Apply easy preset settings and fun effects to your video conferences and recordings.

Adjust colors, brightness, and even pan and zoom your Mac\'s built-in iSight. The picture from your iMac, MacBook or MacBook Pro has never looked so good.

Is your external iSight looking a bit dark? You could install studio lighting, or just install iGlasses to give your videos an instant brightness boost.
	  	
iGlasses is a great companion to your iMage USB Webcam. Fine tune your colors for a perfect picture every time.
	  	
It\'s not just for iSight! If you use a Logitech QuickCam or other 3rd-party webcam that uses UVC or the macam driver, iGlasses will add the same great adjustments and features.
