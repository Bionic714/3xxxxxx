,Gr7,2008-01-30T01:42Z,"all looks cool superleeds ;) there is just one thing itching at me: 

will this support my Core 2 Duo E8400 because on another listed slimmed vista there was a comment saying - ""its for those who dont want to download 4GB or want to run on non- dual core CPUs .."" 
-is that referring to the fact that normal vista is a system hog or something that has been slimmed/taken out, would like to know just to give me peace of mind as im upgrading my computer soon and a new OS would be nice :)"
,angryhadj,2008-02-01T03:10Z,Is this good for gaming?
,drei22,2008-02-01T12:05Z,Gr7 all he is saying is that you don't need DUO Cores to run this. A regular Pentium 4 will do the job.
