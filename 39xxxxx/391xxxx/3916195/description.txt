Per request, most of the esl stuff that used to be available on demonoid.  Not as it was when I originally downed it - the zip is unpacked so you can pick and choose the files (I hope - noob to making torrents).  Most documents are in PDF, but the very few that were in Word were converted to Open Office docs.  Contains Longmans, Cambridge, and Oxford dictionaries, as well as many sample readings for TOEFL, vocab, grammar, practice tests and practice readings.  I found it mostly very helpful.  If you do too, please pass it on.
