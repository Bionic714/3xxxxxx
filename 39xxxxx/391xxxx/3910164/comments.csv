,Snowflake17,2008-04-15T03:20Z,"Excellent, DLing now. If it works, thanks for putting in the effort to reorganize it :)"
,Snowflake17,2008-04-16T04:17Z,Need a seed :(.     55% for quite some time. 
,ptsamson,2008-05-18T18:39Z,"Thanks. 
Tried to stick with it but gave up. 
Looking forward to hearing the whole book."
,conflagrationpwr,2008-07-22T11:12Z,"They weren't ripped properly.  It opens fine in windows media player, but other programs (itunes, and zune so far) recognize the segments as 4 minute videos.  Itunes just wont open it period."
,chaosjenkins,2008-08-15T20:44Z,"Actually, I think it was ripped fine, it just doesn't have the appropriate file extension for iTunes, etc. If you change the extensions from .mp4 to .m4a, you should find it works perfectly. Alternatively, you could go to the trouble of batching all the files in something like mpeg streamclip to convert them to a file type of your choice."
,bulvine,2009-11-30T01:33Z,Thank you I was so bummed when i got the scrambled version. This version is good quality.
,Scazza,2010-05-08T16:41Z,"Something odd happened in mine.  The original files are fine, but in iTunes they're all sped up and high pitched. Anyone know what happened here or how to fix that?"
,neuban,2010-07-21T13:27Z,"Fast download (at 150-200 kb/s), thanks for that, will seed for as long as my computer are alive. But do try to support the upcoming TV-series (or the books), we don't want another Deadwood-ending do we...? Works great in Winamp BTW."
,72Virgins,2010-11-14T05:17Z,"VIRUS!!!!!!! ANTIVIRUS ACTION to be specific, fucking pain in my ass.

Maybe it wasn't this torrent but, it's not a trusted uploader, and as soon as i dl'ed it my que, i got a nasty fucking antivirus action fake security dialog and it stoped me from accessing fucking anything.

I was desperate to find a feas for crows that actually worked, the other mega pack is all fucked up, shorting tracks two mins early and going out of order, but this is not the answer"

No virus. You must have gotten it elsewhere."
