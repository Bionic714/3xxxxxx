,gm4653,2007-11-27T21:18Z,"been lookin for this ever since it came out on ps2 thx, will seed"
,click4dylan,2007-11-27T22:41Z,thanks dude!!!! this game is very rare now and i have not seen it in retail stores for at least 2 years now. oh and i forgot to mention this is the English version
,click4dylan,2007-11-27T22:56Z,if you have gamespy arcade from gamespyarcade.com you can join servers and chat with lots of people from nightfire using that and a whole lot of other things
,gm4653,2007-11-28T00:40Z,"ya i got gamespy too, ill check it out tonight"
,click4dylan,2007-11-28T01:26Z,"if ya guys want me to upload other stuff, i cant think of anything lol"
,click4dylan,2007-11-28T02:56Z,"comments anyone? oh and by the way, if you wish to install any of my mods located on my other torrents or from norulez.net, you must change the install path to where you extracted these files"
,click4dylan,2007-11-29T06:41Z,i have to reformat as i got a trojan on my computer :( i wont be able to seed until tomorrow
,kitcer,2007-12-03T00:35Z,"Thanks man!

I lost the CDs for this, and I can't find anywhere to buy replacements!

Cheers!"
,kitcer,2007-12-03T08:19Z,Works great! Only problem is all the cut scenes are white screens :-(
,andres_ronaldinho,2007-12-03T21:31Z,"hello, im not a noob,but?
how do i nstall this?
wat do i click first?
im really smart with this stuff but ther are no steps to tell me wat to do"
,andres_ronaldinho,2007-12-03T21:34Z,nvm.i didnt read ur headline
,andres_ronaldinho,2007-12-03T21:47Z,is gamespy free?
,click4dylan,2007-12-04T01:28Z,"the cutscenes shouldn't be white. i added them all. try moving everything to c:\program files\ea games\nightfire (nightfire should be the main directory where bond.exe and everything else is located). if that doesnt work, try adding it to the registry. if all else fails. try updating drivers, because i had a problem with the cutscenes before and what fixed it was to install the indeo video codecs and all other codecs (can be found on the internet for free, just search video codecs). you can download the indeo video codecs for free from my website at www.norulez.net  (if you try to download them from the indeo website, they ask you to pay for them which is insane!). the nightfire manual says that windows xp doesnt come with them, so you might try and download those indeo codecs. also guys. you dont have to play just the mission mode (nightfire button on the main menu). you can play online with tons of people if you click the ""Multiplayer"" button from the main menu. the NORULEZ servers (just click join game then click internet and click update) contain the mission maps just like single player except you get to play with tons of people! so sorry for a long boring comment but thanks everyone for downloading! we need players!"
,click4dylan,2007-12-04T01:29Z,"oh and gamespy arcade is free, just goto www.gamespyarcade.com and click download (get the free version, not the subscriber thing). "
,click4dylan,2007-12-04T01:33Z,"if you guys ever see me in the game (multiplayer), my name in it is 2GoldenBullet$ or Bullet$."
,messupper,2008-01-09T18:44Z,oh totally forgot i got this game at home belive i got it on the release day here in sweden :) it truly is an awesome game (exept the last map i hate that 1 it should be harder :P)
,dead_man93,2008-02-10T04:17Z,Thanks for this game!!!:) it is a good game!!
,dead_man93,2008-02-10T04:19Z,ALL seed!!!!!!!!!!!! 
,woody11692,2008-02-26T00:45Z,hey i tried to download this but i ran the .exe file and it said please insert disk 2.  im good with computers but i just don't know what to do with this. 
,click4dylan,2008-02-27T02:48Z,"woody, make sure you use winrar to extract the entire rar file to a folder on your desktop/my documents. the reason it is asking you to insert disc 2 is because it is missing movie cutscenes from the 'movies' folder. try unzipping it again and if it does not work, please try downloading it again because many people have this and say it works. me, myself have used it when i was at another's house. so thanks "
,ThePirateTuna,2008-04-13T01:25Z,"Sorry to bother you, but I  seem to be missing all the levels that have racing games in them, paris prelude and alpine escape. :( just wondering what was up. "
,click4dylan,2008-04-14T03:30Z,"the PC version does not include the racing levels like the console does nor paris prelude, but instead gives you online multiplayer. :)"
,Jeenebeck,2008-05-02T13:08Z,EVERYBODY SEED !  PLEASE ! 
,booten2,2008-05-02T13:18Z,Where can i download delta.lst for this game? I can't open the game coz that file is missing
,click4dylan,2008-05-03T05:57Z,"you must first extract the game from the .RAR file. if you don't you will get that error message. delta.lst is already located in ASSETS.007 so if you keep getting that error after unzipping it/unraring it, it is corrupted. you can't just run Bond.exe from the rar file itself as it doesnt have any resources to use it without extracting. ok? thanks!"
,Mafiaenshevn,2008-05-11T02:02Z,"Seed please!!:D:D


-MH"
,click4dylan,2008-05-15T20:51Z,"roger that! just got my other pc to work again, spent forever having to use this program to destroy all the contents of the hard drive so that it would work again. now i will be able to host a 24/7 server and seed at the same time :) please everyone seed, i need to redownload it on this comp. thx. btw my 24/7 server will be called [NORULEZ].net or anything with [NORULEZ] in it :) please join that server for i dont waste my time and electric bill by keeping a 24/7 server running"

,click4dylan,2008-05-21T06:13Z,"this torrent seems to have more seeds during the daytime here in eastern time zone, so try downloading then! "

,Apollo99,2008-07-04T21:23Z,umm yes hi even been to your website and stuff and im trying to make a server for my friend and i downloaded custoum dedicated server thingy now 1 problem i did everything i saved then started it it opens up but then when i play NF it doesnt work??? Can you help me?Please.
,Apollo99,2008-07-04T21:38Z,o and dont say did you portforward it i already did that.
,Apollo99,2008-07-04T21:39Z,"from here
http://www.findports.com/document.php?id=452"
,click4dylan,2008-07-10T02:21Z,"sry for late reply bud, what does the dedicated server window show when you go to start it? sometimes the server will only show in LAN section of NF for you but will show up for others in internet. i can help you a lot faster if you email or IM me (msn) at click4dylan@live.com"
,click4dylan,2008-07-25T23:42Z,"hmm the only thing it sounds like is you got to the main menu where it fades, minimized, then maximized while it was still fading. that causes it to go black but sound to work. does it work otherwise? try creating a shortcut to bond.exe and then rightclick on it, select properties and ad the end of the target box, type -windowed -width 800 -height 600 +console 1

so it would look similar to this depending on where you extracted the files: 
""C:\Program Files\EA Games\Nightfire\bond.exe"" -windowed -width 800 -height 600 +console 1


what is your video card? are your drivers updated? if its an nvidia card (geforce) www.nvidia.com if ati (Radeon) www.ati.com   
if your video card is made by SiS (such as mirage 2, 3, 760, 939, etc) www.sis.com
if intel (graphics media accelerator) www.intel.com

make sure directx is updated by visiting http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3&displaylang=en

if all of the above fails, contact me again and i will try to help you some more. thanks for seeding and playing!"
,click4dylan,2008-10-25T07:42Z,"your dedicated server may only show up in LAN for you, but promise me if your ports are open other people will see it listed for Internet. it depends on your router and its capability to show ICMP echo requests (ping) whether or not YOU yourself will see it."
,click4dylan,2008-11-25T01:30Z,ya dont need a patch or a serial for this version. its already precracked
,Alllexxx,2008-12-07T02:21Z,Thanks for seeding hardly =D

btw everyone it is highly recommended to update to the latest 3.6 patch at www.absolute-mayhem.net to stop the notorious Outgoing message overflow (lag out) that happens on unpatched versions of this game and all the crashing"
