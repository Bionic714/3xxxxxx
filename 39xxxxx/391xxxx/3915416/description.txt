Welcome to Blood Meridian's 3rd album "Liquidate Paris", where Black Mountains Josh, Matt and gang take you on a 9 song journey deep into the land of psyche/weird/ countryesque -folk. This time around Blood Meridian delve pretty deep into an early 60's vibe where fans of the earlier ESP folkier records, Skip Spence's Oar and maybe even a little early Bob Seger System will find comfort in the grooves of Liquidate Paris. This record began as more of an experiment, tracking to a Tascam 8 track cassette recorder in early 2007 in a moldy basement beneath a crack infested street in Vancouver which really helped produce the overall spooky vibe.
For fans of Neil Young, Skip Spence, and the 13th Floor Elevators.
