"From a cell, a man tells us he has planned the perfect bank robbery; he invites us to watch. An efficient gang enters a Manhattan bank, locks the doors, and takes hostages. They work deliberately, without haste. A snarky detective facing corruption charges is assigned to negotiate. The bank's president has something to protect in a safe deposit box, so he brings in a high-powered fixer. With an army of police surrounding the bank, the thief, the cop, and the plutocrat's fixer enter high-stakes negotiations. Why are the robbers asking for a plane - they know they won't get one. Why aren't they in more of a hurry? If the job's perfect, why is the thieves' leader in a cell?"
