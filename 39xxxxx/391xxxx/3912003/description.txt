I tried to make this as easy as possible to install.

1. Extract simcity societies.rar. You will need a program like winrar to do this, if you can't open, google and install winrar.

2. Run AutoRun.exe. Click 'next' and 'I accept' and whatever and wait for the installer to finish. When it asks for the key run keygen.exe and hit generate, it should fill in the boxes for you.

3. Run SCS_10016_DP1.exe in the patch folder, this is the first patch.

4. Find the folder where the game was installed, this is usually C:Program FilesElectronic ArtsSimCity? Societies. Copy (don't drag and drop, copy) SimCitySocieties.exe. If it asks if you want to replace the exsisting file say "Yes". If it doesn't ask you if you want to replace the exsisting file, then you did it wrong. Make sure you actually copy it, don't just do a normal drag and drop, otherwise it might just make a shortcut.

5. Run the game!

Note: If you ever install a new patch you will need to find a new version of the crack, this really does matter! I've tried it.
