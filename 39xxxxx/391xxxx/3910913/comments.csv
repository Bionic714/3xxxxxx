,l2oXXol2,2008-02-07T23:55Z,"Hello, It freezes due to emulator settings, a google search for that game + your emulator will return the settings necessary, you might also consider using a different emulator...If you are by chance a computer genius i would assume you've tried these tactics and are still having issues, in which case i can only say perhaps you got a corrupt version of that game, i will test that specific game on my xbox today and post if it is a bad rom, in which case it will be my fault.
Thanks for reporting!"

Actually I'm inclined to believe him, I have also seen this sort of compression in other places, for instance NGC ISOS are sometimes around 200 megs, and when unrarred about 1.4 gigs.

No idea how this works though.. Anyone got any ideas?"

,D3Ka1D,2008-04-29T01:38Z,"Well.  I downloaded it, took about 30 minutes... Well worth it.  The only problem I found is that when I played a game (cant remember the name but it was like a monkey who threw balls at enemies to get keys... and it was set up a bit like the Classic DK) anyways, upon playing that I couldn't press ESC to pull up my menu and than after frantic button pressing my computer restarted."

I **EXTREMELY** recommend Terranigma and Chrono Trigger."
,jkillah1,2008-06-05T23:25Z,"To play these on your psp, you need to have custom firmware (m33) with homebrew enabled (or the 1.5 addon from dark alex).  I use 3.9 m33 with the 3.9 version of the 1.5 addon, and I put the emulator in the GAME150 folder.  The emulator I use is SNES9X, which can be found at dl.qj.net, under psp>emulators>super nintendo.  I use the most recent, stable version which is from last month.

I hope this helps you, because it took me a while of searching lol"

Yes, I have some idea, especially in direct reference to GC ISOs.  Two things to note, many times text information is highly compressible, and also GameCube games are padded (with garbage data, all zeros or something to this effect) up to the 1.4GB standard size.   

The padding case is very easily to compress as an algorithm is trivial to come up with, even for non engineering types (e.g. store the data and a reference to the number of repetitions of this data.  Space saved is a linear correlation to the amount of repetitions of this data that were eliminated).  Obviously, eliminating the padding by placing a ""equation"" in its place to expand later, can have a profound effect on space saving (if the actual size of ""real"" data is a lot less than 1.4GB).

Text may have a similar scheme, or Huffman coding, ... not sure... compression is not my area of research.  Anyhow, it is important to note that text data can be compressed quite nicely, so games with a lot of dialog will be shortened  nicely by most compression algorithms."

I tried loading these with SNES9x on WinXP, but it doesn't seem to recognize these files.

I loaded these same files with ZSNES just fine, however, ZSNES is way too pixelated...and blurring the graphics is not a good option. 

I would rather have the original sharpness of the game, which some people said SNES9x does."
