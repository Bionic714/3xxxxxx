,nickbbad,2009-01-07T01:34Z,"this has nothing to do with this post but the marley and me post by AiTB he is a good uploader you can tell because he has a skull and crossbones next to his name which means hes trusted. The reason he has so many movies under his name is because he just adds ""scene"" trackers and doesnt actually upload anything.  When getting a NEW movie only download from people who have a skull and crossbones next to their name this means they are trusted or vip and 99% the movies  will be what it is supposed to be.  People who upload fakes will only have 1-4 movies up and they will be right in a row. Hope this helps you out in the future. Peace"
