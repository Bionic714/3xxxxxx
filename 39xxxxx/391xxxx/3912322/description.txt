AT LAST FINAL EPISODE OF LONESOME DOVE.

Lonesome Dove the Original ep.4

all the Original.episodes.in 4 parts. each part will be posted after i see plenty of torrents to take care of the other downloaders. after that i will seed no more, it's yours to seed I'm on to the next torrent.

 encoded with DivX 4 in the PAL.format. The old 4:3 format was what the series was broadcast in back in those days. some newer TV's can still fit a 720x576 picture from it.
it's encoded to 1200 bits and looks quite good. uses MPEG Layer 3 stero sound.

I found this to be the best western movie {in MY Opinion} that was ever made.

it's the kind of movie that you will find yourself thinking of many days, weeks, even years after you have watched it.
 
{-plot-}         about Two former Texas rangers who decide to move cattle from  South Texas to Montana. Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call run into many problems on the way. -----------{Many problems is an understatement}

Movie starts out a litte slow but after a while it's got ya, making you want to see the next episode.

i am going to post all four episodes starting with ep.1 Three more will follow untill all 4 eps are up.
{THAT WILL BE THE ENTIRE MINI SERIES} 
i will start the next episode when enough seeds are up on each post, to allow me to leave and go on to the next
