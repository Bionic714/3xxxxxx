Since my uploads of the workprint for "Charlie's Family"... http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3384180
and the short films collection of Jim Van Bebber... http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3359074
...I've had many requests over the past couple of years to upload this. However, I'd seen that someone else
had already beaten me to it... but I'm still getting requests for it. After investigating further it looks
like the other torrent has stalled at around 85% with no more seeders, and my rip is a different file size
so I can't simply join that particular torrent.

DVD box blurb...
In the underworld of the American Midwest two rival gangs, the Ravens and the Spiders, rule the streets.
Goose, the leader of the Ravens, decides on one final drug deal before leaving the gang and settling down
with his psychic girlfriend. His life crumbles around him, however, when his girlfriend is brutally clubbed
to death by members of the rival gang. After burying her in a trash compactor, Goose hides out with his
psycho junkie father and plots his revenge! His rampage culminates in a massive street brawl with kung-fu,
gory decapitations, vivid throat slashings, car stunts and bloody gunfights.
This action-packed cult classic is considered by many as a masterwork of independent filmmaking and Synapse
Films is proud to present this film in a digitally re-mastered DVD edition.
