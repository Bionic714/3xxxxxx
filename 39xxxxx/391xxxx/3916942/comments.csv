,FnurplJizz,2009-01-30T21:37Z,"Yep, thanks a bundle for this. Great film! I'd also be eternally grateful for a DVD-rip. Quality is nice, but not sufficient for showing on a big screen. 

Again, thanks."

Do you have The VanBebber Family? It's a 77 minute documentary that was included with The Manson Family (I think..lol)

I just heard about it today, but can't seem to find it anywhere online"
,d-pad,2009-09-25T09:16Z,"@FnurplJizz: this is a dvd rip. the quality is a bit sucky due to the original movie being made on 16mm film.

@berniegrim: yep, i've got that doc on dvd - i may get around to ripping it at somepoint in the future, but please don't hold your breathe ;)"
