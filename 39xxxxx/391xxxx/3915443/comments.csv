,Macsolo,2007-12-01T08:58Z,What's the difference between this one and the others?
,balahir,2007-12-01T20:09Z,You need to have a previous version of OS X installed. The installer will look for this.
,Derty1,2007-12-02T01:07Z,"the version leopard 6.66 gb original actualize too.

,iTCHi-ie,2007-12-02T14:20Z,"WHAT THE HELL IS THE POINT OF UPLOADING APPLICATIONS IF THEY AREN'T GOING TO FRICKIN' DOWNLOAD?????!!!!!!!!!!!!

By the way, what is the correct definition for ""seeding?""

Thanks"
[V],joshua13,2007-12-03T02:04Z,Apple has not sold an upgrade version since 10.1 (which they gave away to all comers for awhile) There is no such thing as a 10.5 upgrade version. They are all full installers. 
,crazysafe05,2007-12-03T11:12Z,Please seed. Thnx!
,piekiz,2007-12-03T11:56Z,"i am new....how do i download? I click on the download link and get a txt like format, not a dmg file"

,myxzyden,2007-12-19T08:31Z,"I manage to download it. W
hen I tried installing it asked me to restart. But after restart nothing happens. Anyone knows how to proceed further?"
,arbyman,2007-12-21T02:27Z,"Yes, this does work (took forever to download though!) and i also got the blue screen after install, so I just followed the simple instructions on Apple's webiste below and it worked.

http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306857

I was lucky enough to have two Powerbooks...

I'll be honest, so far, I can't see any benefits of Leopard over Tiger but maybe i need more time with it..."
,myxzyden,2007-12-22T06:22Z,"I didnt have the blue screen, just a plain restart and nothing happens... 
I just mount the dmg and click install, after that it shows an instruction to click ""restart"" to continue install... 
Am I missing anything?"
,arbyman,2007-12-23T09:55Z,"You need to burn the DMG file with Disk Utility otherwise you can't install it by just mounting it.  You need a DL DVD of course...

For super safte to avoid the blue screen of death after install, before you install Leopard do this:

Go to System folder, then the Library folder, and finally the SystemConfiguration folder.
Locate ""ApplicationEnhancer.bundle"" and move it to the Trash. Important: Do not delete any other files!"

,kgulaalex,2008-01-09T20:09Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL
i have succesfully installed leopard on 
Sempron64 2600 2x512 ram ati9550 256mb
IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR HARD DRIVE
IT HAPPENED TO ME. IT IS NOT A JOKE. THIS WILL CRIPPLE YOUR BOOT FILES:
""invalid partition table""
WITH LUCK YOU CAN INSTALL VISTA BUT NO XP
if you have already installed... leopard is stuck on 60hz refresh rate with no ati drivers and it is IMPOSSIBLE OT RUN WINDOWS APPS ON IT. You will get error.
.
.
.
YOU RISK PERMANENT DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER WITH ANY LEOPARD INSTALLATION.
I am not a n00b and i will not touch os x again after what happened. I AM STILL UNABLE TO INSTALL XP and writing from vista

""invalid partition table"" at boot. BEWARE AND DO NOT DOWNLOAD. i had a perfect case install and still...

DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL ON YOUR OWN RISK. COMPUTER PERMANENTLY DAMAGED WITH ANY LEOPARD NOT JUST THIS ONE. it`s because of hfs.

,mxnbrit,2008-01-11T17:40Z,"Ok people, I have downloaded it a previous Leopard 10.5 from another seeder (steve-jobs) this file was an ISO (7.5 GB size) and tryed to burned with Toast as well as Disk Utility on a Dual layer DVD, whenn verifying or checksuming it gives me an error, after 7, you read well ... 7 DVDs (all crashed!) Finally i was able to burned it without verifying or checksuming. Well, i tryed to install it on my iMac G5 ... not to avail, it did not boot at all. I tryed a few more times, including pressing the C key ... nothing. I know  pretty much what I am doing but I could not find a reason why it does not boot, I am wondering if anybody has any idea what I am doing wrong and if anybody else had the same situation. Any imput it will be helpful please. Thank you! 
Anyways, just in case I will be downloading from this seeder and burn it and try to install it, hopefully with success. Thank you! Ah, I will be seeding."
,Jerk990,2008-01-13T03:04Z,Stop telling everyone how leopard broke your PC if your too stupid to run it on a pc then go buy a mac and shut the fuck up
,municipal,2008-02-23T23:43Z,"what precautions should we take for the upgrade to stop apple from ""calling home"""
,mufffuzzer,2008-03-15T10:01Z,"please, someone seed this stuff...
i've been downloading this for more than a month and i'm only at 60%!"
,chuckasarus,2008-03-22T16:06Z,Will somebody seed. I have tried a couple of other 10.5 Leopard but with no success. I hope that this one is a good one.

,inko_66,2008-04-25T21:54Z,please seed. that only way to get it
,xwangjax,2008-04-27T17:28Z,Do I have to burn this to a dvd? or can I just mount it to the finder and run it from there?
,weezywee21,2008-05-15T23:59Z,plz seed im at 50%
,asmonica,2008-05-23T10:58Z,"you dont have to burn to a dvd, you just need a firewire external drive(usb may work, but might not be fast enough data transfer). first, create 2 partitions on the drive, 1 to use as a boot drive from which leopard will install, 1 to install to. mount the dmg, then go into disk utility and click the restore tab. drag the mounted dmg from the left into the ""source"" box, and drag the one of your blank partitions into the ""destination"" box. now go to system preferences, and go to startup disk. select whichever volume you chose as the destination for your ""leopard install dvd"" and restart. now follow the instructions and instal TO the OTHER blank partition on the drive. worked flawlessly for me the first time.

If so what version of leopard is this? is it below 10.5.7? as im wanting to put it on my ibook. cheers"
,ben4528,2010-04-05T19:09Z,"use this one with caution, cause it screwed up one of my 10.4.11 system, while I was trying to upgrade from tiger. After upgrade the 10.5 system froze up at booting stage. Don't know the reason can't fix it either, download the 12 gig one."
,rsadil,2011-06-26T07:46Z,will this set my hardrive back to fresh?  that's what I'm hoping for.
