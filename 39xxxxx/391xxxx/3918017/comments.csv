,Tichols,2007-12-04T09:27Z,"Hey, I have a question, might be noobish to some of you, but here goes. R5 - what does that refer to - the group who ripped the dvd? or is it something else, cause ive noticed that the sound on many R5 dvdr is quite poor - so i was wondering if there was a connection :)"

,hackzy028,2007-12-04T19:02Z,"in the scene R5 refers to DVDs that get released in Russia a couple of months or weeks after the theatre release date. they usually dont have special features, use 2.0 audio, arent edited so that you might see spots or something of the sort on your screen and thats pretty much it. so the quality of an R5 is worse as that of a DVDRip"
