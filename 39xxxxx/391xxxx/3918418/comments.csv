,flip69,2007-12-02T20:56Z,is this real?
,bowdowntozoltan,2007-12-02T21:34Z,"Yeah... It works great for me. Loads a little slow but really depends on what computer you use.

Works great. "
,bowdowntozoltan,2007-12-02T22:42Z,I'm seeding as fast as I can. Bear with me.
,skytime,2007-12-06T22:20Z,it does work and load quickly... but when I try to open a fill with word or to save with word it all close... why ? ... what I got to do ?  thx
,bj02454,2007-12-15T07:39Z,"I've found that if I install this permanently (to avoid having M$CR@P in my computer registry screwing stuff up) it can't be linked to files with open->with, unless I manually add entries to the registry. However, if I do this it tries to open a new copy of, say, word if it is already open and I open a second file in explorer; the second copy of word subsequently crashes. Anyone else having this?"
,donixa,2008-04-14T06:10Z,"is this working ? all of them ?

i have downloaded from 'portable apps v1.5'

but excel, clip organizer and diagnostic is not working

info plz."
,TVLoafer,2008-09-30T19:49Z,"It looks like these are individual apps.
So, if they were thinstalled seperately then the dependance should not work and you might have some issues, ie. adding excel data into a Word document and things of that nature.
its a great torrent, TY for the upload."
,Nishinoran,2010-06-12T15:27Z,"They look like they're all independent apps, but they're all actually linked to data within the Access program, if you remove Access, none of them work."
