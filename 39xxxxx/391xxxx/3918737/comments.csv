,fn_soldat,2008-02-15T14:46Z,"SquareButton : SHUT the fuck up, you dont have any clue what you are talking about, i run SP1 on both x86 and x64 comps with SP1 ver. 18000 no problem at all WITH paradox OEM patch on a SWEDISH system so fuck of.

torrone - 2008-01-07 15:18 CET:

Your computer wont start, because your BIOS is patch so you cant activate OEM patch, and the only thing you can do is to REINSTALL Vista, and downflash your BIOS. then MAYBE you can activate Vista."
,patelshivam94,2008-02-17T20:43Z,I dont get all the commands listed in the read me file. please help!
,joergen_lo,2008-02-26T00:05Z,"I got a problem with this crack... After completing installing the crack, i get a bluescreen saying that windows was shut down because a file was trying to write to a read-only memory... The file is Royal.sys, the file with the crack... Anyone knows what do do?"
,Superballs,2008-03-17T02:51Z,"jeorgen, 

the problem is that you're running on a motherboard with an NForce chipset, 

if NForce4 then you'll need to boot into safe mode and open up your device manager, try rolling back or uninstalling the driver for the Nforce4 PCI-Express Root Port, if you have an NForce2 board then it will be NVIDIA nForce PCI System Management.

Optionally, you could just reinstall, and make sure that automatic updates are set to notify you and you can simply catch the rogue driver then and hide it so that it doesn't bother you anymore....had the same problem and am running fine now."
,clumsygenius,2008-08-01T21:03Z,went through all the steps with no error but my product key is still the same. is it because I have sp1? or is it because i was running timer lock before this??
