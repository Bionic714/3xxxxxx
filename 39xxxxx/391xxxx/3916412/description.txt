Hello out there

Here is an upload that maybe is interesting :o)

It consists of the following

Slysoft 20071130 (their final programs as of this date)

AnyDVD_6.3.0.0
CloneCD_5.3.1.0
CloneDVD mobile_1.1.6.0
CloneDVD_2.9.1.2
GameJackal Pro_2.9.18.610
Virtual CloneDrive_5.2.0.2


Working patches/keys are of course included (have tested them) :o)
They are as follows
AnyDvd: Crack that replaces 2 original files in program folder, gives
        full HD-support :o)
CloneCd: Reg key
CloneDVD mobile: Reg key
CloneDVD: Keygen
GameJackal Pro: Soft patcher
Virtual CloneDrive: Dont need a patch since its freeware

This package also include

DVDFab Platinum 4.0.1.2 (This program comes with tried, tested and working
                         serial number)

Important notes!!!
All of the above programs are completely untouched originals and not messed around with.
As of always when using patches, keys etc dont forget:
Install OFFLINE without being connected to the net, install, patch and turn OFF
every programs autoupdate feature before going online again...

More important:
Slysoft says the latest Virtual CloneDrive 5.2.0.2 is fully compatible
with 32-bits Windows Vista. I dare to say it isnt :-(
It works good and well as long as you use it to mount, view and
play the mounted virtual Image. BUT, when doing a Clone or Copying
that mounted image it becomes clear that it still have "Vista-issues
needed to be fixed" For this special kind of use, use Daemon tools
instead (at least if you run Vista as your OS)
So if you need to do that use Daemon tools instead....
DVDFab Platinum is a simple to use program what works very well
in the most cases, BUT, when it comes to heavily protected discs
its not as good as AnyDVD (Finded it out by own testing)


Hope you enjoy this little toolbox folks :o)
