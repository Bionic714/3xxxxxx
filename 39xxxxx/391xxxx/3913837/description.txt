The Sweptaways sing choir-arranged a cappella-versions of songs performed by artists such as Lesley
Gore, Jenny Wilson, Black Sabbath, Vapnet, Kiss, El perro del mar, Pet Shop Boys, Monica TÃ¶rnell,
Kate Bush och Embassy.
The Sweptaways are thirty women dressed up in color-coordinated, thematic or simply stunning costumes,
plus an equally stunning choir-mistress who writes the arrangements and directs.
Their name was stolen from a less than acceptable Madonna-movie, and since the fi rst rehearsal in a
shabby Volvo they?ve outgrown both one thing and the other: now they release their debut album Ooh aah
on the only record label with a name worthy of their recorded presence.
The songs on the album are ten choir-democratically elected favorites, and the title is inspired by the fact
that it is deemed unsuitable to mix ?ooh? and ?aah? in the same song ? even though it sounds so nice.
