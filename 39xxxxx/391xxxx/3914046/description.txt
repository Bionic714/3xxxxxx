This amateur video was taken in South Africa's Kruger National Park. On the edge of a lake a pride of lion attack buffalo, catch a calf, but from the steep shore they accidently fall into the lake. The crocks in the lake get interested and attack the calf from the opposite direction. However, the real battle begins when the herd return to rescue the calf...
