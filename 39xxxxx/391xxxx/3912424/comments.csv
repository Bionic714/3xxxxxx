by the way are you planning to do a full translation too?"
,marmitt,2007-12-15T19:49Z,"Thanks Breaker!  Who would have thought they would store the menu and battle system strings as straight shift-js?  I guess it never hurts to open the shit up with a hex-editor.  I would like to continue the project if that's ok with you.  Once again, thanks for lighting the way!"

,Kinsume,2008-06-26T01:14Z,"I did as it says there, I downloaded the image, opened it with UltraIso and replaced the file with this english version. Now I have two copies of Front Mission 5, the original Jap one and the Eng one. The Jap one starts up and works just fine. The Eng one starts up, then goes to a black screen. I know its not my computer since i'm running a AMD Dual Core 6000+ with 2 gig of memory and a GeForce 8600GT video card. Anyone know what might be causing this?"
