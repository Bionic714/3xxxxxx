How exactly is the movie ""clipped""?"

,Skynet-TX,2010-05-05T11:41Z,"Some seconds from the end (the text ""Fine"") is replaced with the logo of the creators of the DVD and there's no scene change but fading: cabiria's face fades out and the logo fades in."
,desertTPB,2010-05-08T09:19Z,"Thanks for info and no problem skynet-tx. its ok for me. and who dont wanna download 8 gb data, wait for a few days. i'm downloading now and i'll rip it x264 then share it. :)"
,desertTPB,2010-05-09T23:20Z,pardon me skynet-tx but there is no clipping at the end of movie. you gave people wrong info! it is not clipped! i downloaded it yesterday. and i'm recoding it now with MeGui. :)
,desertTPB,2010-05-09T23:23Z,"ah i confused but also it was true. no clipping.

After fading Cabiria's face there is no logo in. it goes to black, normally. its totally original NTSC dvd, exactly written as it is. Thanks for uploader."
