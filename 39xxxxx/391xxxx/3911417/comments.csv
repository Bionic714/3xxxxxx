,damon_dusk,2008-01-23T02:23Z,"Keygens commonly appear as virus' to cheaper AV software. If you are worried, go scan ever keygen you've ever downloaded and see for yourself.

As for this one, the copy is good and lots of extras with it. Good torrent."

,gitarrpoet,2008-01-31T14:50Z,on http://q3.tinyrocket.se/ you can find q3 server. Not online always though.
,BenjamminHumpZ,2008-02-07T00:18Z,No Virus... its like damon_dusk said... keygens look like viruses to cheap av programs.. besides there are plenty of other cd keys floating around the net.. so if your that worried download a key and not a generator...
,mm-artin,2008-02-15T14:36Z,"When i try to install the game the setup disappares and nothing really happens. I can see a process called Setup.exe but nothing happens, anybody else got this problem?"

,altaiir,2008-12-08T17:10Z,"You don't need a key to play online - not on all servers. Just press escape, when prompted with cdkey.

Mathias' problem is a config-issue. You need to create a q3config.cfg inside the q3 base folder."

,altaiir,2008-12-08T17:14Z,"And a last one... When you've installed the game, just run the point release. It's a plain install, like the game. The excessive zip-file, is just the a folder (I guess), which you need to copy to your q3-folder. Same deal with OSP, if it isn't executable."

,Butterzroxxx,2009-02-24T22:43Z,"CheeseFrog is right. If you just hold down the number 2 until it says valid key, it works fine. That's what I did and it accepted it. No need for a keygen."
