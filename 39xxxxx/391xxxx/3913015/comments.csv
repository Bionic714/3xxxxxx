,Nizze_Hult,2007-12-01T15:04Z,"My DVD-player don't recognize this as a DVD. Menues doesn't work, nor the subtitles... "
,NofinnishsubsthankU,2007-12-10T21:59Z,"Nizze_Hult: His other movie ""In the Shadow of the Raven"" works, I'm sure this one works fine too. I'm gonna dl this one now. This is the best part.

Did you use a burning program that can handle .iso-files or did you just burn the .iso as data?
Thanks to Hrafn_Raven and the people that are still seeding."
,geban,2007-12-11T15:53Z,"ItÂ´s just burnt as .iso data unfortunatly.
Does anyone kno how I kan burn it to a dvd so my dvd player understands it?"
,uffesnuffe,2007-12-11T21:10Z,"My DVD player doesn't recognize this iso file either. (Burned as an image file with Nero). It can't be opened with DVD Shrink or ripped with DVDFab Decrypter as a real iso. It it is a data file that has been given the file extension iso as geban seems to imply above, then I also would be grateful for any suggestions as to how to resolve the issue."
