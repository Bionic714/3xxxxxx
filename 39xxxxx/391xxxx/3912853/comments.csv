,PHBFO,2007-11-28T17:52Z,"Can anyone confirm that this works pls?:D
And also on the Phantom?"
,PHBFO,2007-11-28T19:31Z,"It works, thank you very very much!
Now I can finally fly the Phantom!"
,punit69,2007-11-28T20:13Z,"very strange my FS9 after the crack not work and the firewall report connection to a crack site IP, there is a trojan on dll?????????"
,dbg19,2007-11-28T20:41Z,"Warning, it connects to a bogus pirate IP!!!

Also, it DOESN'T work with the Phantom. It will only work for a while, but it quits after some time."
,palmofsweden,2007-11-28T20:59Z,I bet hes a cloud9 guy!
,palmofsweden,2007-11-28T21:01Z,Cloud9 should be ashame.
,fulcrum_21,2007-11-28T21:58Z,"THIS CRACK WORKS! And there is no virus or trojan. You can check it with any virus-scanner. This reseed was posted by me, cause there were problems reported with my first post. The crack is also available on WoS, no problems with viruses or trojans there too. Don't let bother you by comments of Sangalli and friends. It does not connect to any bogus-site. As a proof you can disconnect your PC from the net during installation. YOU DON'T NEED ANY KIND OF INTERNET CONNECTION DURING THE FAKED APPROVAL PROCESS. When all Addons work you can delete the dlls from your PC. So there won't be any problems with viruses etc.

Just be careful with upcoming pseudo-cracks and new dl-products by cloud9. On the other hand, they'll be out of business very soon. So the crack is also very helpful to those who bought cloud9-products and will miss their support in the future. "
,punit69,2007-11-28T22:09Z,Very strange fulcrum_21 you are a guy of Cloud9? or your name is Sangalli? on my pc the problem persist.....
,fulcrum_21,2007-11-28T23:16Z,"Just check this thread ,,,,

There is a dot between www and fs2004

Maybe you have to register. This will clarify all doubts."

The crack works perfectly but I had to read the readme file and follow the instructions exactly. I have texture issues but that has nothing to do with the crack. Thanks because I've been waiting a long time to run the F4."
[T],stevekasian,2007-11-29T04:03Z,"The crack is legit. The Res Snapper first uploaded it to WF after finding it on a Russian FTP server. It has been tested and validated by numerous peeps, both at WF & at WoS. The readme file was translated and the crack was painstakingly tested with all Cloud9 products until a precise installation tutorial and overview of effectiveness was created.

Anyone who says this crack is a virus or trojan is FoS, plain and simple. Looks like the Cloud9 guys are just pist that someone found the ultimate way around their long effective anti-piracy measures, and they're trying to throw you off.

Don't take my word for it - Install ZoneAlarm and place the Internet Lock on before using it, just to prove it to yourself. :)"
,dbg19,2007-11-29T06:57Z,"The crack doesn't work with the Phantom. It will only fly for a few minutes, then it quits."
,PHBFO,2007-11-29T08:41Z,"I don't now what you guys are talking about! This is a real crack that works, even on the Phantom!!"
,carltonyuk,2007-11-29T08:54Z,Well It works for me with all the Cloud9 scenery I've installed. People need to read and understand the readme file. Thanks fulcrum for this great upload.
[T],stevekasian,2007-11-29T09:07Z,"Well, you know how it goes - people don't follow directions to a 'T', and then complain cuz shit don't work. lol

Hey dbg19: You forgot to reitterate your false claim that ""connects to a bogus pirate IP!!!"". What happened to that one? lol"
,sgnauz,2007-11-29T09:12Z,"don't take me as a fool but I have a question: this crack ""does not work with the FSX-scenerys of cloud9 and the Zurich-Scenery of FSDreamteam""... this means it doesn't work on fs9 zurich too?
thanks"
[T],stevekasian,2007-11-29T10:26Z,sgnauz: CORRECT. It DOES NOT work for FS9 Zurich. Working on that...
,sgnauz,2007-11-29T10:43Z,all clear! thnks
,palmofsweden,2007-11-29T12:13Z,"Ok, sorry then."
,Panodilo,2007-11-29T18:24Z,"Well, Stevekasian has been around since I urinated in the primordial soup, so I trust this crack. Problem is that no doubt all CloudNein products have been fixed so as not to work with this one. Is anybody sitting on any cool ones? Phantom? Bergen?"
,BlackBug,2007-11-30T06:56Z,"I agree with Panodilo, with Stevekasian vouching for it, I am sure this is a legit crack. But the sad news is that Cloud9 has started patching its downloads so as to not work with this crack. I just finished downloaded the F4 Phantom, installed it & followed the procedure mentioned in the crack. But FS quits after the ""trial period"" expires in 5 minutes or so. Ouch !!! I have enough faith in my knowledge of the english language & WinXP to claim that I have followed the instructions right down to the T."
,BlackBug,2007-11-30T07:00Z,"So, it would be really interesting to know if anybody has downloaded, installed and successfully cracked the F4 Phantom, after me. In which case I gotta read between the lines. LOL. Or else, PHBFO would be kind enough to share the spoils with the rest of us pirates ? Thanking in advance. By the way this crack does not work with the Cloud9 Amsterdam Update 1.03 either (tried that last night)."
,BlackBug,2007-11-30T07:01Z,"But, last yet definitely not the least, a huge THANX to fulcrum-21 for sharing this with us. Keep up the good work mate. "
,Panodilo,2007-11-30T16:23Z,"I have now dowloaded every fucking file from Cloud9, so when the next crack comes along we'll have the whole collection deliciously crackable. I'll seed them should that occur."
,zkalos,2007-12-01T10:43Z,"Yes!!!
I have dowloaded every file too, and yes, every FS2004 pack is working !!!  Thank You very much. Just follow the proper procedure in the readme."
,fulcrum_21,2007-12-01T14:18Z,The c9 guys have uploaded a new version of their addon-manager now. It is also included in most of their download-products. So make sure you use bglman.dll version 1.3 with the crack and not the new version 1.41 for fs9!
,PHBFO,2007-12-01T18:24Z,"Yes, but where is 1.3?"
,lanc545,2007-12-01T20:18Z,"BHBFO has uploaded the following torrent for the Cloud9 Phantom. It provides the previous downloadable files from Cloud9 prior to Cloud9 having made any modifications to defeat this crack. This crack will work with these files.

http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3916414/FS2004_-_Cloud9_F4_Phantom 

Do a search on FS2004 if the above link does not work."
[T],stevekasian,2007-12-02T07:59Z,"...or not. Just install any previous version of C9 product installer with v1.3 bglman and extract it. ;)

Obvious method, of course... but figured I'd throw it out there anyways  :)"
,slasherblazer,2007-12-02T14:31Z,Can someone pls upload FSDT Zurich pls!
,ricko16,2007-12-03T20:14Z,thx it works for scenery addons but does it work for the Phantom F-4 and F-104 (planes from cloud9)
,slasherblazer,2007-12-12T04:04Z,"Does this work with the AMS 1.03 update? When I try clicking ""buy"" on any product, nothing shows up!"
,777-200LR,2007-12-17T15:18Z,DON'T DOWNLOAD ! CONTAINS A TROJAN !
,kevster86,2008-01-19T02:28Z,Is anyone else getting an error when clicking the download button?
,KingMusjo,2008-01-25T01:00Z,"This does indeed work!!! Disconnected my internet connection and it worked perfect in ""offline"" mode aswell...

However, I got to work with AMS, LAX etc., by copying the bglman.dll/dat from an older version! But how are you suppose to install newer sceneries like Bergen wich uses the new version of Addon Manger??? 
When I try it, the bglman.dll gets overwritten - I then replace it, with the older version, but that results in the disappearance of the Bergen FS9 menu from the Cloud9 Addon Manager in FS2004?! 
Am I the only one experiencing this, and has someone else succesfully activated Bergen for FS9 with this crack? If so - how? :)

A little help here would be hot! :-)"
,Myrdin,2008-01-30T22:59Z,"damn, it doesn't work with AMS 1.04!"
,Phil82,2008-03-15T15:30Z,yes all the cloud9 cracks on tpb are history. with amsterdam 1.04 and the new fsdt sceneries nothing of the old products work anymore
,GoldenScimitar,2008-05-07T04:08Z,"The real problem is this:

There are no complete Cloud9 or FSDreamTeam downloads in TPB under the same BGLMan crack.  So basically, even if I install 2 sceneries from Cloud9 that are under the same BGLMan, if I tried to install another Cloud9 airport available from TPB with a different BGLMan version, then that particular one will work, but the other cracks will be overwritten, making it hard to complete a full Cloud9 collection.

My request is, ALL Cloud9 sceneries under the SAME BGLMan crack.  Please respond back to this.  Thanks."
