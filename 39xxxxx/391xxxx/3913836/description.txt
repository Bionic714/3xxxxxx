This is the only Christmas song done by them, as they are Jewish and will probably never release another X-Mas song again.  This was sung only by Jaron, and is a remake of a song originally written for a girl to sing.  

HILARIOUS song, he kind of sounds like Michael Jackson here, but with a better voice.

Merry Christmas, guys!
