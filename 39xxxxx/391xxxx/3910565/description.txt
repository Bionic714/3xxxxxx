The sound of the U.K.-based Supreme Beings of Leisure is classic Austin Powers-Les Nubians out of Me'shelle Ndegiocello, Sadi, Shirley Bassey and Eartha Kitt. Singer and lyricist Geri Soriano-Lightwood fronts a trio of loop-mongers-Kiran Shahani (bass, programming), Ramin Sakurai (keyboards, programming) and Rick Torres (guitar, programming)-who, as is obvious from their intelligent tracks, have done their homework. Slow hip-hop/jazz grooves, fired with synthesized sitars, piccolo snares and big-drop bass, make for a sound worth hearing over and over.
