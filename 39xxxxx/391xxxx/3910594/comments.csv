,HCWMD,2007-12-07T18:06Z,the quality is not good! is it cam recorded?
,nordmani,2008-01-24T00:45Z,"not only that the quality sucked, the movie stunk!!!! everyody who have played the hitman-games knows that 47 is all about finess, timing and stealth.. not going into a club and shooting the whole fucking place up.. and what's up with that russian assface for a woman? they made 47 soft? huh?  i can't stress how disappointed I am at this movie. give the picture 3/10, sound 2/10 and for the movie itself a generous 1/10, atleast one got made.. maybe next time they'll make Hitman justice.. FUCK "
,blemishednicely,2008-01-24T01:23Z,Not likely...'tis the law of sequels-maybe this was the story of Agent 17? I strangled that punk bitch to death...sob...should've been the director instead.
,nordmani,2008-01-24T22:46Z,"yeah, not likely, i know. portrait of a fools hope i guess.. hope the theatres burns down while showing this mockery of a movie that could've been a slam dunk..  hope the movie flopps, the actors die and for the grand finale the producers gets fistfucked so hard 'til it poures shit from their eyesockets... MOTHER FUCKER (i just seem to be unable to let this go)"
,Leif1965,2008-01-29T21:48Z,If anyone want to dowload the real movie of HITMAN or other movies than you can go to www.FilFix.se there are also many other that real. TRY IT. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. From Leif-inge 
,GoldenGun007,2008-01-30T14:50Z,"The Movie is pretty good. I know that mr. 47 not is the same in the games and the movie but how can they make a movie there can sell and be popular without any action, and killing ????"
,abcdefghijklmno2,2008-02-01T00:27Z,"@GoldenGun
A movie without killing and violance you say? The games name is Hitman (as in assassin, killer etc.). How doya suppose that game would work without any killing? What we want is a movie where a cloned super assassin kills 3 ppl in an overcrowded room without anyone noticing."
,Chaos_rde,2008-02-02T04:15Z,"well, scince everyone is saying the quality sucks, i'm not downloading this. But to everyone saying this movie sucks, fuck off. It had the 3 great elements fo a movie, blood, titties, and booze. (ok it was wine in a resteraunt and a drunk russian skank, but it still counts)"
