The other release on TPB, the one by noncenonce, is so far superior to yours that i'm even suggesting you take yours down if possible. I can't say with confidence I know how the releasing business works.

Why?
For starters, the general quality is not that good. It's not a proper DVD-rip. Sure, it might be ripped off of a DVD but the quality is still bad. This is the kind of video you want to see in the highest quality possible, and yours does not cut it.
But the thing that makes this video unacceptable is the fact that the picture is compressed sideways fr책n 16:9 to 4:3, rendering this video useless.
I'm sorry, did you not notice this!?
For flying spaghetti monsters sake, why would you make it like that!?

The other rip is awesome, yours just suck.
Seriously.
I hate ranting at people but that's just the way it is. 
Learn from it.
Cheers.."

Been up for going on 23 hours ;)"
