,OpusDeiPenguin,2007-11-30T05:28Z,"Ah, it warms my heart to see DCP again. With thanks to all the hard working scanners & DarkElf for putting it all together."
,omechron,2007-11-30T05:36Z,Good old DCP. If only everyone were as reliable. Thanks again for your tireless efforts. Forget the Juggernaut. You guys are the only thing in comics that can't be stopped.
,Iamacheese,2007-11-30T05:48Z,Too many leechers T_T

,pox70,2007-11-30T16:14Z,What should a man do without the onderful DCP. Been really worried for not being able to read the wonderful Cable&Deadpool. Big thank you to scanners and The Darkelf.
,OpusDeiPenguin,2007-11-30T16:46Z,1 seeder can be quite normal on this torrent during the first day or two. You forget that things have been in an uproar with Z-Cult's recent problems. Most likely a lot of people have been unable to get the files from other sources to help the torrent along. Be patient.
,Astralia,2007-11-30T17:03Z,This is a great way for me to get US comics since i live in Sweden... Altho i do always buy the Swedish Marvel comics here its nice to be able to get the American ones as well wich isnt without hassle here in Sweden.
,betz1106,2007-11-30T17:06Z,"thanks for the heads up, i guess i am just used to the old demonoid/zcut speeds right away...."
,brega10,2007-11-30T22:47Z,"A big thanks to the Elf for this!  You Rock man!

God, I hope the Demon finds a new home soon..."
,kenners,2007-12-01T19:39Z,"There's nothing I need here, but I thought I'd say a big THANK YOU on behalf of other DCP followers everywhere (and following Z-Cult's recent events).

,ddsave,2007-12-02T03:49Z,"I'm also having problems with this torrent.  I'm using BitComet and even though it's been running for 3 days straight, I'm still at 0.0%.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Any thoughts?  All my PB comic torrents have read 0 seeders for the past 72 hours."

Adding my thanks to the chorus DE."
