No serial number is needed.

To install the game you'll need to do one of 2 things:
	1.   Burn the .iso image to a blank CD as a disk image, or
	2.   Mount the .iso image to a virtual drive with a program like PowerISO, and run it from the virtual drive

Once installed, you'll need the disk to be in the drive to play the game, or have the .iso mounted in the virtual drive.

I hope you enjoy it, and if so, please buy it.
