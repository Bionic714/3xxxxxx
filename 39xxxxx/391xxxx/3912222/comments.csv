,_Rarr,2008-05-30T20:42Z,"Downloaded quickly and installed easily.
Game works brilliantly!

Thank you :]"
,_Rarr,2008-06-01T19:59Z,"Okay i'm going to answer a few problems with this file.

For your information I am playing this on Windows Vista and it works perfectly fine.

""When I install I can't play the game, the shortcut doesn't work"".
If this happens then install the program again but save all the files into a different drive, NOT the C:\ drive, as for some reason this caused me problems. I put it in the E:\ drive and it worked fine.

""My program crashes after about 15 minutes""
The timing is just a coincidence but I believe it's because of torrent downloads / uploads. I noticed playing without a torrent on causes no problems at all.

""The framerate is a mess""
In the graphics options turn off the ""Post-Filter"". This also works for Hitman Contracts and Blood Money.

""This file is a virus!""
It's not, but some virus programs pick up the trace of the program as a virus. But I can assure you there is nothing wrong with this file.

Any other problems just post them here and i'll pay attention to them ^_^

BUT I have one problem of my own.

I heard that the Hidden Valley level is incredibly difficult using v1.0, but every time I download the updated (1.01, 1.02) file it either doesn't work or works fine minus the sound.

Any suggestions?"

,ZeoJoe,2008-06-20T16:42Z,"This game works perfectly fine. If you are new to torrents or mounting images using Daemon, 120, etc. then I suggest ya learn real quick.

,XenOtai,2009-01-06T07:21Z,"Just installed this right after completing first game. Seems so shitty in comparison with it. Action is slow, 47 moves like a worm, guards see through my disguise, map doesn't stop time ingame, new inventory system is just lame. Hitman1 can be both stealthy and grindy and i don't really want to play Hitman2 as much as the previous part."
,XenOtai,2009-01-06T07:28Z,"Yeah, not to mention the visibility of enemies on the map. Just imagine how crappy Rotterdam from Hitman1 would be played with enemies on the map."
,XenOtai,2009-01-07T10:58Z,Finished the game on Normal level. Massacred every enemy on every level. Boring with that terminator health and no stealth needed at all.
