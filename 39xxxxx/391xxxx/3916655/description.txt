This one is my favorit. Movie is just great. Sources picture quality was good. Runtime isn't so long, so there is DTS audiotrack too. Avarage bitrate is still 4377. Original menus was also good. Only bigger thing I made, I converted in chapter menus  backgrounds to still pictures and get more space for video (over 100MB). Everything unnecessary is removed.
I like this version and movie and hope you like this too.

There is a Sample and high resolution finnish cover.
