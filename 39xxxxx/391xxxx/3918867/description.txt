A new film by Eammon Crudden (of "Berlusconi's Mousetrap" fame) in association with Revolt Video.

The film documents the emergence of the various Irish anti-war movements after 2002, when it became a national scandal that the Irish government was facilitating the US war effort by allowing them unfettered and unchecked access to Irish airports, especially Shannon Airport. All the more a scandal because Ireland is supposed to be a sovereign and neutral country. The film was filmed, narrated and edited by Eamonn in a style that is uniquely Irish.

The film is released under the Free GPL license and the author is willing to make the source material available to interested film-makers who want to put together their own version.
