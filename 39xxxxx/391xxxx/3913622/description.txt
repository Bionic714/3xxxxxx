Retro Horror Remix have been providing obscure horror fan edits to the online horror and torrent community for little over one year. A FAN EDIT is a film modified by a fan/viewer to change either the film\\\'s pacing, artistic merit, or add/delete specific scenes to alter to overall viewing experience.

PIECES: Grindhouse Edition contains the following changes which differ from the official release:

-During the title sequence, a title card reading \\\"One Thousand Cries Has The Night\\\" is sloppily inserted over the original \\\"Pieces\\\" title card.
-Inserted a quick shot of the freaky mask just before the axe meets the mother\\\'s head in the intro to the film.
-The scene when the popular girl on the skateboard crashes into the giant mirror is deleted, to remove poinltess and goofy comic relief.
-Inserted a \\\"Missing Reel\\\" segment right before the girl at the pool removes her top. The scene picks up when the killer is seen dragging a blood-soaked garbage bag.
-When the cop yells \\\"STOP! Or I\\\'ll BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT!\\\", I warped the word \\\"BRAINS\\\" to sound like a film-induced audio glitch.
-Added additional film damage/grain when the girl is attacked in the elevator. Later, when the police discover her body, I zoomed-in, tilted and inverted the shot of the officer vomiting.
-Added another \\\"Missing Reel\\\" segment when the boy has sex, and the under cover Linda Day is attacked by the Kung-Fu instructor. I only show the reporter\\\'s death scene and continue with the killer going to his hidden closet.
-Removed the infamous \\\"Bastard...Bastard...BASTARD!\\\" line.
-Added addition film damage/grain throughout various parts of the film.

Presented in it\\\'s original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Roughly 10 minutes removed. Download contains DVD Artwork and the film in VOB format. The DVD contains an opening \\\"Grindhouse\\\" trailer show before the film starts.
