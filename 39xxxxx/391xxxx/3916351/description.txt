    Game Notes:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Fight anything anywhere anyhow... and by any means necessary!

    Universal Combat takes you into a seamless universe full of epic space

    battles, massive ground skirmishes, fierce naval engagements and even

    tense dogfights above the planet?s surface. In solo mode or in multiplayer,

    in first- or third-person view, play as a marine, a star ship commander

    with a full crew, or a pilot in the latest space fighter.



    Universal Combat brings together the greatest components of any war

    together in a single game. Conceived in late 2001 as Battlecruiser

    Generations, the fifth title in the long-running Battlecruiser series,

    during development it morphed into much more than a massive space

    simulation. As Universal Combat, the new action-based focus,

    direction and premise of the new incarnation caters to a wider

    audience of action and space sim fans alike.
