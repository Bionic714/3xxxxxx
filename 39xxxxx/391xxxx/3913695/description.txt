ok so this one is NOT part of the sounboard official boots from this tour, but i thought maybe some of you would like it anyway.  i have no idea who taped this, on what, or from where.  i don't really want to give this a rating, so someone who downloads it can go for that messy task.  i don't think i realized how spoiled we got form the soundboard recordings until right this very second.
