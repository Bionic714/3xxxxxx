how do i fix that ?
Thanks "
,dreadbunny,2007-12-13T19:20Z,"You need to install a program like daemon tools, it's a virtual drive that you can mount the file on and it will install and play the game through that drive. Just google daemon tools and you'll find it. It's a free download"
,Bergh85,2008-01-06T19:19Z,How do I get a key to make this game work.?? The installation asked for a cd key. 
,alapy,2008-01-07T16:08Z,"it doesnt have cue in it and cant find cd a's cue from anyhwere (only for other discs, from dc++) "
,hvm,2008-01-19T10:10Z,"use daemon tools (version 4.0+) and just select 'all files' and each cd when needed. the key is in the file 'serial.nfo'. you can open it with any text editor (don't click on it, because windows is gay and tries to open it with system information or something)"
,logogog,2008-02-03T18:36Z,"Whenever I mount the image using daemon tools and try to click on it, it says the file is corrupted/ doesn't work with windows, please help."
,zacke94,2008-02-24T13:00Z,Uhm... There are just some VLC-files... What should i do?
,hvm,2008-02-29T15:17Z,the're not vlc files. use daemon tools or something to mount them and install using the serial you find in there.
,Julie23,2008-03-03T00:48Z,"I've downloaded the game, but anytime I open the folder there are no icons that resemble the typical 'set up/install' icons. I downloaded Daemon Tools Lite and have tried to install it that way and it does not work, it just says 'please insert CD into F drive.'

Please help. Thanks."
,Julie23,2008-03-03T00:50Z,"P.S. There are just 4 .bin files and one serial.nfo file, I've tried dragging and dropping each one to the F file (Daemon tools) and none work, they all say 'please insert disc.'

Hope that's more specific so you can tell me what I'm doing wrong.

Thanks."
,420_everyday,2008-04-01T06:22Z,Just finished downloading. i mounted the files and installed them and it works great thanks for the download.
,Gus_Gus,2008-04-08T02:33Z,"Okay, I have 4 VLC files that won't show up when I try to mount them onto daemon tools. THEY ARE VLC FILES HERE. What do I do with these VLC files?  It will not let me mount them.
Some easy to understand advice would be helpful."
,willgrace,2008-04-09T23:05Z,"Download Daemon Tools

,Stuntmanner,2008-05-01T14:11Z,"Here's the guide for newbies to install, using Daemon Tools.

1. Go to http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download.php?mode=ViewCategory&catid=5
Here u can get daemon.

2. Install it.
3. Left click the Daemon icon in the lower right
corner of the screen and select the ""Device"".
4. Mount the file  (Those u have downloaded.
5. Use the CD-key from the .NFO file (If there is one)
6. Install.
7. Copy the crack from CD1 to the folder you have installed the game to and say yes to overwrite.

I could do this when i was 13 mates :P (Or before, i can't remember xD)
Hopefully this helps. I haven't downloaded it yet but i'm about to."
,Stuntmanner,2008-05-01T14:16Z,"Ooh yeah, and if anyone would seed with some more speed then i'll seed at max speed for others aswell (I have a 10 m/bit upload.. Worth a thought ;)  )"

,joshakazam,2008-06-18T05:20Z,the files in mine are VLC files which dont show up on daemon tools any solutions and yes they are VLC and they are not .bin files they are VLC anty solutions that are simple?
,joshakazam,2008-06-18T05:29Z,ok these are .bin files but they wont work with daemon tools because they arent picture files but sound files
,joshakazam,2008-06-18T06:30Z,what program should each .bin file open with?
,Altair117,2008-06-22T01:02Z,"i cant find the crack file can someone help me pleas , "
,hvm,2008-06-24T15:09Z,Just do what stuntmanner said. If it doesn't work you are doing something wrong.
,Hassassn14,2008-06-26T13:23Z,"how do u get it to work, have downloaded deamon tools but the files are bin. and the system ask me which program i should open it in. Which program should i use? Please Help.

,MP3zilla,2008-06-28T18:22Z,"daemon tools is a good friend of mine, i've been using it for about 4 years and i have to say; these are showing up as lousy vlc files and not bin. sorry if anyone could explain to me how to get daemon to recognize them because it doesn't even when i do the ""all files"" option, i'd be greatful. thanks"
,gonewho,2008-06-30T02:55Z,"Why are you retards mentioning vlc files?

,Tapout25,2008-06-30T03:50Z,please seed horrible download speeds
,Zarnik,2008-07-01T12:44Z,Keep seeding...!
,hvm,2008-07-02T23:22Z,"It is impossible for the files to not show up in daemon tools. Don't get used to clicking the files you want to use and expect the computer to understand what you want to do. If you want to open them with daemon tools just select them from daemon tools. Also remember to select the ""* All Files"" option because daemon doesn't know it can read them :P. Use the keygen found along with the .bin files in the .nfo file and copy the crack from CD1. It has to work, I installed it and played it just fine."
,hvm,2008-07-02T23:28Z,"Dr.kella, you do't want pictures files either. You want CD images which these files are. Read my previous comment or go back and read stuntmanner's.

MP3Zilla, like I said in the previous comment daemon does see them. Maybe you didn't click the right option, maybe you weren't inside the correct directory or maybe you need to upgrade daemon tools.

Hassassn14, are you an idiot? What do you think the point of installing daemon tools was? Run Daemon Tools and an icon will appear near the clock. Click on it and give it the first CD (use the ""All files"" option). Now install just as required, changing the CDs as necessary and entering the serial found in the .nfo. The crack is on the first CD.

I'll try to seed this as much as I can but I've got other uploads and can't hold the computer on all the time."

,hvm,2008-07-08T11:35Z,"Zerun: I'm sorry, I don't know what is wrong because it works fine for me. Maybe you have a broken installer? I'm using XP service pack 2 too. If nothing works try installing an XP version that's available on PirateBay (can't remember which is the one I found). Also I have no updates but I guess you don't too."

,killmenot21,2008-08-04T03:46Z,i finished down loading the game and i open the folder all i get are vlc media files and msinfo document that doesn't work -.- Zzzzz lame
,Bravan,2008-08-04T21:05Z,"It moves terribly slow and my comp and when i try to exit it,it wont let me i really want to play this game real bad,does anyone have any suggestions on how to make it move faster"
,hvm,2008-08-05T01:49Z,"Well it does require a decent computer but the most it needs is RAM. That's because it has a lot of data at a time. If you want a quick fix my bet is on a few more RAM. But first you should try to update video drivers (that helped with artifacts on my machine) sound drivers, etc. Try to disable stuff one at a time to see if you can isolate the problem."
,Smashrocks,2008-08-12T04:08Z,"Ok, some of you are saying ""This doesn't work!"" here is what you do. Convert the .bins to .iso. Someone posted a comment that has a link to a program that does this.  Load it using Daemon Tools.

But Smashrocks! Where's the crack and serial?! I took it upon myself to upload a 10.8MB file to 4shared.com. Here is the link.

,Killersjobie,2008-08-15T12:34Z,"you dont need crack. just make a virtual drive and place the .iso there. AND HOLD IT THERE! its just like putting a CD in ur drive to play a game. dont unmount it. and if ur PC cant run the game its to slow, im sorry.

To seed. keep the torrent ON. dont turn it off.

NP"
,Killersjobie,2008-08-15T12:35Z,"sorry for DP but

watch my link for Bin2ISO on page 2."
,Smashrocks,2008-08-18T23:05Z,"
Sometimes you can use a virtual drive to mount an image, and the game reads it to start the game. Other times you need a No-CD patch. For me, this game needs a No-CD patch. Which is why I posted a link to one in my last post."
,Killersjobie,2008-08-19T16:35Z,ok im sorry didnt know. could be so:D

,rckpyro,2008-09-30T20:39Z,"Got it! you just have to keep alt+tab""ing"" back to DAEMON tool everytime the installer asks for the next cd and change the mount to the next .iso in the downloaded torrent. (there should be 4 different ones, ending in a, b, c, and d corresponding to disc numbers) but my computer's too big of a piece of shit and my graphics card isn't good enough to run the game. awesome. what a waste of time."
,hvm,2008-10-04T15:36Z,"Hehe, that sucks but this game shouldn't be such a problem for the video card. What it does need is a lot of memory. When I had only 256MB of RAM it wasn't playable when there were many villagers. Getting 1GB of RAM solved that problem."
