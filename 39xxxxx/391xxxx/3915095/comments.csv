You first need to install daemon tools which is included, and you will need to restart your computer with that, then you run daemon tools and mount disk 1 with it, if you don't know how, search daemon tools on google and read up on the site, can't be bothered explaining XD then you install with the minimum installation and then mount disk 2 once finished. You then install the european patch and play, the patch is to allow online play. Enjoy :P"

,RoggleToggle,2007-12-07T00:35Z,why doesnt daemon tools recognize the bin files?
,lovetoseed,2007-12-07T03:34Z,"i don't know, if you change the file type to all files and open cd1, then the autorun will load, if not it will be in my computer as a cd rom."
,RoggleToggle,2007-12-07T22:50Z,how do i change it to all files?
,lovetoseed,2007-12-09T04:11Z,"this is now being hosted on a 2gigabit connection but for some reason it isn't connecting to the new people that download it unless it is being restarted, so if youve been downloading for like an hour or so and the speed hasn't picked up, then leave a comment and i will restart the seeder. peace out"

,b82336,2008-11-07T11:17Z,WHERE IS THE CRACK MAN?
,Xabache,2009-05-29T19:02Z,"The .bin mounts in daemon tools but no drive pops up nor does it engage the auto install, just sits there lifeless and useless. Burnt the .bin to cd, doesn't do anything when loaded. Also tried creating a .cue file

FILE ?U4EA_Disc1.bin? BINARY
TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
INDEX 01 00:00:00

this did not work either. All .bin no play... please advise."
