Wow. Does it ever bring back memories.
Grade 9. Southern Ontario. And this band was just HUGE! Haven't heard their music in years. Maybe 20?!

I've got the album stashed away that I bought in a Goodwill but this is way better.

I've been collecting a ton of vinyl and tape from the 80's. Lots of local/Ontario/Canadian stuff that you'll NEVER see on CD. Does anyone remember Teenage Head?!

I should get my shit together and up this stuff.

Thanks,

HJ"
