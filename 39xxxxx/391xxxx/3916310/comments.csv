sorry, cant seed as much"
,Hatecomplications,2008-05-14T04:50Z,"That site http://www.pda4x.com/read.php?tid=55791	doesn't have detailed step by step instructions including how to install XT s/w and and transferring the Garmin maps to the N95-4 which has an internal GPS receiver and no external memory.  And why would anyone want to use a BT GPS when the built-in is fine?

You also need to create a file sw.unl as well as find and download an IMEI to card converter.  

Again, no instructions included."
