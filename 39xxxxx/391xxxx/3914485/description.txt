The story of Jeb Stewart, his romance with Kit Carson Holliday, friendship with George Custer and battles against John Brown in the days leading up to the outbreak of the American Civil War. 

Starring Errol Flynn, Ronald Reagan, Olivia de Havilland and Raymond Massey.

There's plenty of action and romance to keep the die-hard western fan happy. One of the better Warner Bros. "A" westerns of the period, although the sound is a little muddy and distorted.
