,cyberscribe,2007-12-01T09:11Z,"There are still bad spellings, lol.

Examples: Gard for Guard and Alah for Allah..."
,lienenkugel,2007-12-02T03:30Z,"0612devil, this is the first time that I have had to play with subtitles, so I had to do some research. If you use DIVX, when you open the avi file, you have an option to use a specific subtitle file. Just point it to the .srt file. I would assume that some other players have the same option."
,lienenkugel,2007-12-02T03:43Z,"It should work on VLC player too. I didn't see the option on Windows Media Player. Just open up your player first, then hit file\open. Browse for your AVI file, select the ""subtitle"" option and point it to your .srt file. Happy Viewing!"
