How to get rid of manufactures logo in oem version.

further tip

to browse thro pirate bay without feeling guilty of visiting a porn like website , install firefox plugin and browse https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865 
with this installed you wont see porn ads at the sides in this website.

iam sure most of the downloaders here dont care for this , their filthy comments shows them all up"

,Mini_Bulten,2008-01-20T01:13Z,"Windows Vista...!!!!! USCH!!!!!!!!!!!

Vista är det sämsta MICROSOFT har tillverkat..
För det första: så slöar det ner datorn 40% mer en  XP.
För det Andra: så måste man ha MINST: 
3.0Ghz processor Och 1024Mb RAM. för att kunna spela dom senaste spelen....

Jag fattar bara inte att dom säljer DATORER med tex: INTEL core 2 duo 1.8-2.6Ghz
eller AMD dual core 2.0-2.8 processorer...med 
VISTA som standard Operativsystem.
När Dessa DATORER inte klarar av DAGENS 
Spel & Program....
Ja visst man kan spela vissa spel..
men då är det KANTIGT.. ""rent av ser skit dåligt ut"".. + lite lagg ""Bugg"".

Näee jag rekomenderar inte att ha VISTA i datorn..  "
,egge_n,2008-01-25T15:39Z,works fine with the exception of no audio. but that's be cos of my old Sound Blaster Live! value. anyone got any idea of how to get it up and running?
,Larryboy,2008-01-26T11:34Z,"Gå till www.ubuntu.net och ladda ner Ubuntu 7.10 i stället. Mycket bättre än Vista, finns även fräcka effekter i Ubuntu om det är önskvärt.

Bara ett tips"
,cantableog,2008-01-27T13:23Z,"Please somebody , help me out. I got Vist Home Premium. Will this download as an up grade for my system or am I gonna have to go through that whole thing of downloading different drivers? That answer & the serial code is what I'm waitin' on.... Please!!!"

,erlende92,2008-04-10T18:02Z,"Ok, heres the deal: 
- Downloaded
- Burned as .ISO with Nero 8
- Put in computer
- Installed (but oh, here's the wierd stuff)

As I installed the OS, the installation stopped at about 70% through at ""Completeing installation""

So... What do I do about it? Hope for some quick answers, as I've searched what feels like the ENTIRE WORLD for a torrent like this, and I will not be satisfied with 70% completed installation :)

HELP!"
