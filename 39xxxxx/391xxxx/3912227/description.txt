BEYOND THE RING OF FIRE (1996)

Lawrence Blair, whose ten-year odyssey through Indonesia with his borther Lorne resulted in the classic Ring of Fire series, sails again, eight years later on a retrospective voyage to many of the islands first visited and others never previously filmed. After the tragic death of Lorne, he takes thirty friends (including one some of you will recognize) aboard an expeditionary vessel  ? from the Asmat swamps of West New Guinea, gradually westwards to islands of giant bats, hidden reefs with an affectionate Moray eel named Honey, surprisingly gentle but potentially deadly, banded sea snakes, the volcanic Spice Islands, and the megalithic cultures of Timor and Tanimbar  ? on an cruise through tribal civilizations in transition, ranging from our distant past up to the present day in Bali. Includes scenes from the film that Lorne had been working on when he died called Cycles of the Soul.

In loving memory of Lorne of the Monocle - a wonderful man, fantastic Balderdash player, and consummate dream wanderer.
