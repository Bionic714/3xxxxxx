How are you doing? I need you to send me another email off Pirate because, I lost my address book. However, I was on them all forever, all of them over 5.00 ratio, I think the Donny and Marie one alone was close to 8 itself. I am not sure. Same as before with this one. I will stay on till no other is on it. Been looking for ya. Glad to see ya did not forget about this treat. :)

,sacerdos,2008-06-20T14:22Z,"Hey Osmondmania....I've got a few of the ""Holy Grail"" that I'm recording right now.  Thing is...I'm not super great on the ""clean up"" from vinyl.  Can you offer any suggestions as to what program to use that makes the ""clean up"" as effortless as possible for an idiot like me?  I have Adobe Audition , Nero 8 and Magix.  I just don't know how to really approach the clean up in the best way.  Alternatively, I can put the files on CD and mail them to you and let you do the clean up if you can.  Sorry for the long post.  I just registered so I could contact you, but there doesn't seem to be a way to do that except through the comment section.

Regards...

Sacerdos"

A couple things in response to your comment as I am the original uploader. First, Don't know if you noticed but there was some complaints about the quality of my lp rips. How excited do you think I am going to be to upload more stuff when people just rip on someone that is just trying to do something nice here and put up the complete Mp3's of all the Osmonds LPs? You might say I just got a bit discouraged, that's all.

The other thing is, you probably are aware that the Osmonds have re-released almost all of their Earlier Lp's onto Re-mastered Cds. So actually there are better quality official released cds that were released in England. For example I bought all of the seven original D&M re-mastered earlier 70s releases off Ebay brand new, still in shrink wrap cds. They sound ""fantastic"" believe me! 

So, with the combination of getting a bit tired of some negative comments and official re-issues of the earlier cds available, I really didn't see the need to keep uploading Osmond torrents.

They have not re-released cds of the real early stuff, like when they were kids back in the 60s during the Andy Williams days, and of course I have those all ripped into mp3s so those might be uploaded. They have been more re-releasing things from the seventies, like The Plan, Brainstorm, Osmond Live World Concert Tour, Love Me For A Reason and those kinds of things."

Hey, GREAT!, Glad to see you are helping out ripping some LP's into digital MP3's. Whichever you prefer is ok with me. I can either clean them up, or send  you the program and have you take a shot at cleaning them up. Please leave me a message of your preference. Either way is cool with me!"
,killerwolf1986,2008-08-28T08:11Z,"Could somebody seed this torrent? I'm trying to finish getting Marie's albums, since the ones I have, weren't released on CD and I don't have a turntable to listen to my LP's on. Thanks in advance!"
,jasdts,2009-09-08T18:48Z,Here I am again. Yiur torrents are fantastic and I truly hope you do do a part 5. The problem there are no seeders. It took me well over a week to get all of Jimmy osmond and now I'm stuck at 94% of part IV with no one to help finish it. Could you please seed it so I can get the rest of this very good torrent. I seeded Jimmy osmond at a rate of 27 to 1.
,jasdts,2009-09-11T18:58Z,Please seed this torren. I have been sitting at 94.7% for a week now. Thanks so much
,jasdts,2009-09-20T17:54Z,Please Please Please SEED
