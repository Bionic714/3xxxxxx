,spidey329,2010-12-18T04:41Z,"Not sure why, but track 11 on disc 4(Live album) does not DL properly. I seemed to skip over it in the initial DL and when I went back to try just the song itself, it downloads, but when I try to ""add file"" to iTunes it says it's an invalid filename. When I try to play it by right-clicking, it does nothing and gives no option to rename. 

The artist info was a little screwy on the other tracks too, but nothing 20 minutes and a little Amazon research couldn't fix. I just changed all of the ""album artist"" info to ""Various Artist"" leaving the track artist alone and reconfiguring them into individual albums.(A Very Special Christmas 1,2 3, etc. [4 is the Live album])

Overall an excellent upload with very minor tweaks(mostly personal) to be done. 

Thanks a lot jj0069!"
