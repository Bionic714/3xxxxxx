,streamcap,2008-03-03T00:44Z,"Since I see you found it fit to rar the entire album in order to get us to download whatever junk you included into it, I see it fit to call you this:

YOU LAME ASS SON OF A STINKING DESERT EAGLE RAPED COYOTE!!!"
,vr1985,2008-04-16T02:51Z,"Merci!

Good quality. You only need to find the album cover, because the one thats in it, is a fake.

Streamcap has downloaded a other torrent or something :s. 

Thnx for the upload. Enjoy the sound of ElizĂŠe "
,fleetcommand,2008-11-17T09:55Z,"The album is great, so thank you.

However, I had problems since Amarok couldn't play this album for some reason (I don't know what caused the problem, since Winamp could play it).
But the quality is not that great. When you start a track, you may hear a little clicking sound which is not good.
I recommend the other torrent (the Mexican tour edition) instead.

Hispa, it might worth to re-encode the album if you're the one who encoded it."
