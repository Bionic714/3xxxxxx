Fly the Airbus A380 V2 for FSX



Our first version of Fly the Airbus A380 has been a bestseller worldwide. This new version now includes four different models of the A380 super jumbo..

From the outset, the Airbus A380 was designed to be the largest passenger aircraft. With its unique two story passenger compartment, the newly designed Model 900 can be outfitted to carry an incredible 650+ passengers up to 7800 miles.

For those of you who want to climb into the cockpit and fly this huge and exciting aircraft now, one of our long-time developers, Tolga Piskin has painstakingly create four models of the Airbus A380 for FSX: the 700, 800, 800f and 900. Graphic artists Garry J Smith and Ed Knapp have carefully reproduced the many liveries of the A380 launch customers.


In addition to the strikingly handsome outer aircraft, youÃ¢??ll take notice of the interior including 3D virtual cockpit. The special instrumentation includes a simplified Flight Management Computer (FMC) similar to what is found in the real thing and complete easy-to-follow documentation to learn how to use it. The FMC works with the Flight Simulator's built-in Flight Planner and allows you to fly virtually hands-off except for take-off and landing. 

Fly the Airbus A380 V2 also includes enhanced scenery of the Toulouse-Blagnac (France) Airport. The final assembly of the Airbus A380 is performed at the airbus factory located in Toulouse. The Toulouse airport is now replete with custom AI traffic.
