,stiffeg,2007-11-29T12:55Z,It is framerate friendly and it is nice textures and cabin. But panel is not like the real a380 but you can fly good with it
,stiffeg,2007-11-29T12:56Z,wich airbus a380 do you prefer then?
,Frodge,2007-11-29T13:01Z,"Probably the 'as real as it gets' version =)

The real a/c's performance is little known for public, as well as the cockpit layout. Abacus has just made a fantasy, based on...? You name it."
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-01T07:27Z,"Just a question. Not sure if It will work. But i was wondering if i can install this to a dummy location and then copy and paste teh files into fsx. You're probably thinking i'm crazy right ""why not jsut install it"" well for some reason my windows xp has problems with certain installs and it locks my pc. But my dual boot vista doesn't have any problems. So i would like to install it from vista to a dummy folder then copy and paste all the goods into my fsx folder on my xp system. I've done it with other apps. 

I think it's pretty lame that my xp can just freeze at any minute with certain/randam installs and unrars. anyway any info will help. Thank you so much for the up. it's the only a380 for FSX i've seen. I noticed abacus doesn't ahve the layout down but ah well. it's free and i like recording video's of thsi huge plane landing in obscene places. kinda fun to watch. 

Thanks! check out my fly tampa for fsx torrent!! "
,stiffeg,2007-12-01T10:20Z,"Flightsimerr - 

Do so if you want, it will work if it is in the simobjects folder and the other effects etc. in other."
,Frodge,2007-12-01T13:37Z,Or boot into Safe Mode and then do ya things.
,FlightSimerr,2007-12-01T20:45Z,"SAFE MODE!!! what an excellent idea! thank you so much. I can't beleive that it I didn't even consider that. I have a 20gb's of flight sime stuff that i can't install it always locks up my pc but only in TINYXP never in vista. It's surprising considering i'm pushing a E6420 PC2D, 8800gtzOC, 4gb ddr2 800, dual SATA 500gb 300/s HD's. I think it's a problem with the installer package in Tinyxp and i have no way of updating it so i may go back to regular xp for flight sim.

It's great though because when the computer and running it only utilizes around 150mb of RAM . and when i'm in vista i'm utilizing no less than 700. Crazy. Vista is an excellent OS but i just have to upgrade my hardware a little more before FSX will be any good in it. I tell yah the dx10 preview looks pretty sharp though. 

Thanks for the help!! "
