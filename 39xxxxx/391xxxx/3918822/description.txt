This is NOT the comedy "Allo Allo" but the British drama from 1977-1979 that preceded that show. It's hard to come by in Sweden but aired recently on Swedish television and this is a DVB-rip of that series.

Format is MPEG2 720x576 25fps, full DVB quality. Unfortunately there are Swedish subtitles hardcoded into the picture, but the audio is the original English one.
