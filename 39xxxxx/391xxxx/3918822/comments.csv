,sostra,2009-01-14T01:36Z,"Took me about 30 hours to download, all the programs work perfect, and I'll stay and seed for quite a while. The show was just as good as I remembered, except for maybe the acting in some of the minor roles, mainly at the beginning of season 1.

Read somewhere on the internet that almost all of the episodes were carefully researched and then based pretty accurate on actual events.

I also remember back from the 80's, that one of the Swedish newspapers had an article about what happened to the real-life Monique, Albert, Natalie, Alan etc, and that almost all of them were tortured and killed by Gestapo. Even though it is now more than 25 years since I read the article, I remember that it said that Monique was tortured by forced to drink water until her inside burst. It made a very strong impression on me then, and I thought a lot about how that was practically possible... Maybe it was just something the newspapers made up? Anyway - this little bit of info doesn't mean that I have revealed anything about what happens in the series. I just think it adds value when watching to know that most of it is realitybased, and that the characters really existed.

This series is not only TV-history, it also shows a piece of important real-life-history.
