Release Notes:
        Now for a not so very common release type, multi audio .avi.
        This was a very compressible movie, giving room for some bonus
        stuff. Swedish _and_ english sound, with subtitles of course!
        What? 899kbps seems low? Well, not really. The QF is still 
        close to 0.2 and due to the simplicity of the cartoon itself 
        -- complexity not always being a guarantee for success ;) -- 
        this little baby still rocks!. That extra ~100 kpbs that others
        throw in really does not make much of difference, especially
        not if the resolution is in the lower range, and as such, does 
        not zoom very nicely. Also, most versions circulating is at an
        exact 2.40:1. That, according to us, being ~3% off the "real" AR
        after full cropping has been applied.
        End credits as always with lowered quantizer in favour for the
        main movie pixels.
        Enjoy!
