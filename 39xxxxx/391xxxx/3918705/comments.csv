,yoless,2007-12-20T19:36Z,"there are tutorials on the internet just search for ""ultrastar add songs"" 

in short:
you have to put the *.txt in a separate folder (its good to name it like the artist + title)
then you copy the *.mp3 in that created folder
then you open the *.txt and look at the ""MP3:""-thing
the *.mp3 has to have the same name as stated in the *.txt

hope you understood everything, english is not my mothers tongue
