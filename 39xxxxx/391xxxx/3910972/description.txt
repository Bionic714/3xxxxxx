New band Adelaide is now in the St. Louis Scene. Comming at you with more then just boring riffs and screaming. Guitarest Jon Gottschalk and Singer Ryan Schulze combine their deadly skills in music when overpowering lyrics combine with melt your face guitar riffs while Drummer Josh Collins, Bassest Nate Lynch, and Pianoman Scotty Lilly fill in those spaces between with catchy scales, fills and bass lines. Be on the look-out for Adelaide in the local music scene... Were taking this scene by Force! YEAH!!
