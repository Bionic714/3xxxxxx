Descent is a 3D first-person shooter video game which spawned two direct sequels (Descent II and DescentÃ?Â³). The Descent name was also used for an unrelated space simulator released by Volition, Inc. called Descent: FreeSpace due to trademark issues.[1] Descent was developed by Parallax Software and released in 1995. Although unsophisticated by modern gaming standards, it is still cherished by a strong community of fans, particularly for online multiplayer, and new levels continue to be developed.

The series has a strong following due to its unique \"six degrees of freedom\" gameplay. However, because this gameplay can be challenging and strongly favors the use of a joystick, Descent never gained the popularity of more conventional ground-based 3D first-person shooter games.

Compared to other 3D shooter games, Descent never became particularly popular; probably due to its increased demand to the player\'s ability to keep his orientation in a fully 3D environment with a 6dof flight model. Also learning to effectively exploit (tri-) chording - increasing movement speed by simultaneously pressing the acceleration controls for several movement directions - steepened the learning curve. The challenge this poses attracted and still attracts players even 10 years after the first game of the franchise appeared.
