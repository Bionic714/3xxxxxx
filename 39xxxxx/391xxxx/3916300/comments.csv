,Ziiiiiiiiit,2007-12-30T21:36Z,"The sound och picture was not so good, though I really liked Enchanted as a movie so I didn't think about it that much. One good thing with the picture is that it was never shaky or anything like that."

,tsw_gnaget,2008-01-03T16:49Z,"wakleman - 2007-12-11 22:09 CET: 

bad quality...where is axxo ? 

axxo releases DVD-RIPS. Which actually come from DVDs!
These are taken by a camera in the cinema, and thereby the not so good quality.. But you can't expect a dvd-rip och this movie now! It's just been released and the only was is by this!"
,projektdeth,2008-01-08T05:57Z,Another crap quality torrent form Ltt.  Go figure...
,moviemasters,2008-01-09T11:40Z,"Seriously fun movie, recommended for fans of musicals and the old 2-D Disney animation.

,abbikins27,2008-01-21T06:03Z,"Not excellent quality, but good enough it convinced me to see it in theaters.

Good sound.

It was taped in theaters, so aXXo wouldn't have anything to do with this. He does dvdrips.

Stop complaining."
