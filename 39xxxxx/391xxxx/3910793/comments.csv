,Dragunhart,2007-12-05T16:31Z,"I had major trouble trying to play this using Vista.  
But by tons of experimentation (and hours of headache) I was able to find a ghetto way to play from now on. (explained in Vista)  Here are some clarifications for those who are lost.



WHAT ARE THESE ISO FILES AND HOW DO I USE THEM?-

- There are three CDs, so they are split into three .ISO files, which means in a nutshell, CDs only operable to certain programs made to open ISO.  Your best chances to do this correctly is to burn the ISO image using programs specialized for such a task.

-Roxio is a standard built in free program on current windows vista computers to burn ISO images onto disks

-Some computers are able to burn ISO themselves without third party programs, check your disc drive to see if this is possible.




INSTALLING THE GAME POSES A PROBLEM!

-If you are getting error messages that keep repeating themselves to insert the Play/Cinematic/Install disc despite having it already in the drive, make sure that your disc is not damaged or had an error during the burning process (Best to use rewritables in case of this happening)

-For me I had the ""insert play disc"" error with ""quick install"" mode on, ""Full Install"" mode posed no problems identifying the disc.

-remember the key is wrong inside the txt file so the correct one is 9EMD TJKC PJCX DK77




I INSTALLED THE GAME SUCCESSFULLY BUT IT WONT START FROM AN ERROR MESSAGE! (differs according to situation)

-Run the Videotest program before you play, it automatically runs during setup, and is also located in your Diablo II folder called ""D2VidTst.exe""

-As the instructions say, make sure to replace the ""Game.exe"" file installed in the Diablo II folder, by RedlionIII's ""Game.exe"" located within the downloaded torrent.

-Update the game as soon as it is installed by activating the updater in the torrent called ""D2Patch_111b.exe""

-Most games dont work because they require you to restart your computer.  

-If all else fails, google the error message by retyping it in the search engine, most forums would have the answer.




FOR VISTA USERS (compatibility/run issues)-
1-Follow all protocols and directions above this step.

2-On any Diablo II shortcut (such as the one on the desktop) right click the icon, go to properties, and click on the ""Compatibility"" tab.

3-Check the box ""Run this program in compatibility mode for""

4-Choose a windows mode.  The XP version or NT version are most likely to succeed.

note-My version of vista for some reason could not accept NT or XP at first, but after activating ""game.exe"" and then clicking on the Diablo II.exe application, the game started.  From then on I was able to play the game just activating the Diablo II application (which is set in compatibility mode for XP)  This may work for you, it was just a speck of luck for me."

TO GET THE GAME TO RUN YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR INSTALLED DIABLO 2 PROGRAM FILE AND DRAG game.exe ONTO YOUR DESKTOP AND REPLACE IT WITH THE ONE IN REDLIONIII'S TORRENT FILE. all you have to do is click and drag it over. also the right cd-key is

,MagicalJoe,2008-03-21T00:28Z,"Lost your legit LOD cdkey??

Okay guys I did some work for Blizzard North back in the day and I know how their serial system works. With that.. I also know its flaws.
In beta testing for LOD the test team I was on was having huge problems with our keys being recognized by bnet so what the developers of the online portion did was link the D2 classic cd key to the LOD key when it was entered on bnet for debugging purposes, they also made an automated email service where you send in your DII classic cd key in a specific format and it sends you your LOD cdkey that corresponds to your DII classic key.

Okay now on to the business end

I doesn't matter what email you use to send for the key.. as far as I know because my buddies all have hotmail and that worked for them and I used an old aol account and they all worked so I'm just assuming the others (live, yahoo, gmail etc.) work too...

so first off make a new email to:

blizzard.north.battle.net@gmail.com

long story as to how blizzard.north.battle.net went to gmail (used to be blizzard.north.battle.net@bnet1g.com)

with this in the subject field:

%hg_seri%confi_em1

^copy and paste that!! VERY important

then in the main body paste:

%hg_loas/%termin3;6
%lordod*diab_x2%recev
%(your diabloII cdkey here)
%tmit_rsendr% hed1

so it should look something like this:

%hg_loas/%termin3;6
%lordod*diab_x2%recev
%6PNPD7P1HZ8MPZNP
%tmit_rsendr% hed1

REMEMBER!! do NOT but dashes in the cdkey! the program cannot read the key with dashes in it!!

usually it comes back within 2 minutes but it took one of the guys in my team 2 days as I recall.

it will come back with both your DII key and your LOD key It could have my name in it somewheres because that's my personal code for the return loop.. anyways have fun and do it quick because if they see that ""I'm"" trying to get my lod key 350 times in a couple days it will get shut down so hurry!!"

,xXForgedWarXx,2008-04-28T05:58Z,Well I am a bit new to this. And I have never used MagicIso before. So do I need an actual blank cd to burn it on to? Or do I just somehow burn it to my computer?

,Redlionlll,2008-04-30T04:25Z,ohhh ya one more thing the cd crack is not that great and only works if you mount the iso and use the cd key otherwise not gonna work and u can burn the iso to disc to and use the crack that should work as well

Download Daemon Tools and use it to mount the install disc iso file. Then install with the following CD key *GG97 - R76C - W9EP - BPGJ*. After you are finished installing, run the patch that is provided for you. After running the patch swap the Game.exe file that is provided for you with the one in the folder that you installed the game to, it will most likely be C:\Program Files\Diablo II. When finished, use Daemon tools to mount the play disc iso file, run the game and it should work. If it doesn't you most likely messed up, in which case you should take the Game.exe out of the file, uninstall and try again, if you do it again and it still doesn't work and you are positive you did everything just right then... Something is fucked up and I can't help you with it."

,mikkel89,2009-10-04T02:35Z,"for anyone trying this on Vista:
for Diablo II original: 
- patch it to the latest version(1.11 or summin) 
- right-click the .exe file(or desktop shortcut) 
- select properties, then compatibility
- select run in 256 colors(or summin)[no compatibility mode needed]
- run the file you ""modded"" and ignore the compatibility warning, you just fixed it!

For expansion: the same without the patching part

NOTE: i used original CD install, no crack or anything. so it might not work on this one!"

(just did), didn't work. i have vista, i installed properly using the correct key, i even tried changing compatibility to 256 colors and using another system other than xp or 2000, but no luck.  something is wrong with the fog.dll or game.exe file, the patch said i was properly updated, so i couldn't even tell you the problem. i suppose i gotta just play lame ass games like fallout. but hey, if you find a fix, email me @ frnnkdlxx@yahoo.com. that's my throwaway email. thanks."

,tds20,2010-09-28T02:08Z,"Ok I'll make things easy and very interesting this is what you all need and required.
1st The Name of the cd is your own name now the serial to the product is 22WT-RT4G-VWC7-W27E ok now what you need is roxio program to do this with by downloading that torrent or use that came with your pc place a blank cd and be sure you label the cd. Once you burn the install cd to one disc the play cd in another disc and the cinematic is on the last empty disc. 

Please to be sure if your going to play on battle.net make sure you run it off the cd not on a image loader. The image loader will not work during online game play I tried that already that is the best solution that i will give you considering i give my respects to the owner of this program that lets us users to download and to seed on.. please do seed and continue your game play but once you are able to load it all on the cd's 1st run your installation cd then your play cd and your cinematic cd then the play cd but it all depends how it's installed... Happy Gaming and Good Luck. "
,tds20,2010-09-28T02:10Z,Burn all three to each cd then run the installation then use the key provided 22WT-RT4G-VWC7-W27E then type in your own name and plus a note cd imager isn't a good idea to be played on since it has no networking capability to play online please refer it on the cd and run the internet game there
,mojadmr,2010-09-30T21:12Z,"need more seeders...
please seed.."
,A_Sly_Fox,2010-10-04T12:02Z,"Okay, so. I've read through all these comments, and I can't find one that's gonna help me - so at least I know I'm not repeating what everyone else has said. 
I've done everything properly, although when I go to play it, everything flickers for a second, and then it comes up with, ''Diablo 2 critical error - Error 22: An error has occured while intializing DirectDraw"".
Help?"

,durmitor,2011-04-19T18:44Z,"I used this CD key instead of the one provided by uploader:

22WT-RT4G-VWC7-W27E

Everything else worked perfectly. At first I thought I would just check out the game since I only played first diablo and the graphics are really outdated, but the game is really good and it makes up for the graphics. I will definitely keep playing till I finish. Thanx for the upload."
