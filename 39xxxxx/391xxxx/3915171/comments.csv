,seeder77,2008-09-08T03:45Z,"He played a bad guy twice, but damned if I can remember the name of the movie.
We all know he played ""shady characters"" many times.
But.
The reason he almost walked away from filming this one, in Jane's word's, were, he had to kill a kid.
I'm willing to bet he was probably a decent man in rl.

Thanks for the u/l, I bought this but lost it in the fire.
Cheers dude/dudette.

,whraglynx,2011-06-02T04:54Z,"Hey WeeKnighT, thx for this one and all your great uls!

@seeder77, @testytest1;
Doesn't Fonda's role as prison warden Woodward W. Lopeman, alongside Kirk Douglas as inmate Paris Pitman, Jr., in the 1970 film 'There Was A Crooked Man' qualify as a thoroughly bad man? ;-)"
