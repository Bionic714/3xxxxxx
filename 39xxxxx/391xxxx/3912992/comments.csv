,MFJ-DK-NJ,2008-01-02T22:09Z,Please seed - I've been stuck for about a week now...
,Tigge81,2008-01-05T15:08Z,Please seed!
,earthdragon72,2008-01-06T20:19Z,"Please can you stay on for two more days.
I am at 45% and I will take over for the seeds
I really need this"
,nastasia1,2008-01-11T19:26Z,I will stay as long as you need.
,bjstrng,2008-01-16T23:54Z,I've always thought this was the greatest series. My wife and I enjoy watching them immensely. I'd like to have them on disk. Thanks Natasia!!
,ImtooDizzy,2008-01-23T22:43Z,"@Nastasia1, Could you please seed this torrent as this one has only 1 seeder and over 150 waiting. This is by far the most wanted release by you... thanks in advance"
,tm1503,2008-02-03T08:53Z,Seed please! 
,tm1503,2008-02-08T20:15Z,Seed please! I started downloading season 1 series two weeks ago!  
,madeye-cat,2008-02-12T12:54Z,"Please seed. Im giving almost 500 kb/s and only reciving 0,8 kb/s. Pleeeeeeease !!!  "
,MFJ-DK-NJ,2008-02-14T22:44Z,"Hey there,

Is there a better seed status on it now? Or is it a wasted effort?"
,davilles,2008-02-15T13:59Z,seed guys i got 30% of kings left before I can fully seed
,davilles,2008-02-16T14:46Z,i need like 15% of 1 left and got like .2 max in 2days comeon seed 
,ottnal,2008-02-18T23:25Z,"nastasia1 can you please seed!
I started to download this torrent in december and are now on 27%..... "
,MFJ-DK-NJ,2008-02-19T23:50Z,"This really is not funny at all..... I have gone from 19,9% to 21,2% in 5 days. Nastasia, please seed. I think I'm right in saying that a lot of us, will keep seeding for a long time, once we have got the torrent. It must have taken a huge effort putting this torrent together, it's a shame if it will never come into play because of missing seed.

Please seed........."
,nastasia1,2008-02-25T16:41Z,I do my best guys. But i'm the only one who seed yet. And I have upload limits. But anyway still going to seed.
,miss-marple,2008-02-25T21:12Z,"hi, 
I'm a great fan of midsomer murders, but I see it is only in English.
Can I find somewhere Dutch subscriptions for this serie? "
,Bundis,2008-02-28T13:20Z,"nastasia, it doesn't matter if the seed is proceeding slowly. But, please, don't stop seeding completely. We're getting worried that you've maybe left us, since you've not been around for a couple of days"
,Round2it,2008-02-29T03:34Z,"nastasia1 over 250 of us are holding at 29.7% and wanting seed, I have seen at least 7 seeds but only 1 will share. Many of us will continue the seed but we have to get it first.. "
,Bundis,2008-02-29T20:57Z,"...and it's ticking in bytes again! :-) Thanks, tasha!

It will take LONG time to download ALL the files as it's a HUGE torrent - maybe until October 2008, but it doesn't matter. The quality is good and I like the widescreen"
,tm1503,2008-03-04T22:43Z,"Does someone, by chance, have the torrents previously uploaded by Lilsella? Can someone please reseed episodes 3, 4, 5 and 6 from season 4?
Thanks in advance"
,Ponkes,2008-03-07T19:05Z,Stuck at 44.7% - please seed!!
,pinguloo,2008-03-13T14:34Z,"nastasia, thanks a lot for seeding this so much wanted torrent. may i ask if you are uploading other stuff at the same time? if there is a way you could allocate more bandwidth to this torrent that would make a lot and a lot of people very happy! "
,katy_weasley,2008-04-15T02:39Z,"Pleese seed, I am stuck at 88%.  Will seed once I am done downloading.  Thanks a lot Nastasia for this wonderful upload, I hope I can finish downloading.  I love this series.
Katy"
,Bundis,2008-04-22T23:21Z,"Whooo hooo !!! 95,3% With current speed the torrent will be completed in just a couple of days!!! :-)))  Wondering how much Nastasia has uploaded during these months !? 258 GB up here ...so far
"
,katy_weasley,2008-04-27T02:07Z,"Pleese seed, we are all stuck at 99.8%! Thanks"
,vmelia,2008-04-27T17:24Z,"Hoorah - Just finished downloading.
How come Azereus now claims there's 142 seeds? It was 2 or 3 yesterday. Did we all finish at the same time?"
,katy_weasley,2008-04-27T18:08Z,"Yay, finished downloading, thanks Natasha. Seeding now........"
,vmelia,2008-04-29T00:11Z,"I forgot...
Thanks to Nastasia and the other 'early' seeders."
,ReggaeMaster5000,2008-07-06T13:50Z,"im at 0.74%... my estimated time is jumping about between 9 days and about 30 days... the highest speed ive seen it get was 90kbps... its a frustrating torrent but one i'm willing to hang in with just because i love midsomer murders.

,mhale622,2008-11-29T04:25Z,"I'm happy to find this highly recommended series; it's rare to find well done police procedurals.
Thanks nastasia1"
,wigik,2009-01-05T17:10Z,"No english subtitles for this great series?english is not my native language and i would like to apreciate midsomer murders but without subtitles is very hard. 
Someone has to have it, please upload in some server so i can make the download. Please i bag it, thousands of times. By the way, thanks nastasia for the uploading."

,natedawg6t9,2009-11-29T23:33Z,Big Thanks Nastasia1! I was tempted to buy the sets for my grandma until I realized how over priced they are out in the US. Not to mention the sets aren't even full seasons. I am only downloading season by season to spare my harddrive the pain. But I am seeding as best as I can to keep this torrent alive! Also I give this torrent a 10/10. Great picture and audio. I look forward to your season 11 and 12 once I get that far!

,bil_gr7,2011-07-17T17:03Z,"rbourke1 you must be a real psycho. It's funny how you go from ""Kindly Convert From Avi To MP4"" to ""YourÃ© Dead Fuckin Cunt "" only because the uploader doesnt convert 62GBs(!) of avi into mp4 so you can watch it in your fucking phone. Quit bitching and convert them yourself asshole! You can use pocketdivxencoder, google it. Most of the people will watch it on their laptop and don't give a crap about mp4, stop being a psychobitch and either do the same or fucking convert them yourself. And don't quit your medication, obviously you need it."
