,Furberg,2007-12-23T00:29Z,"Hei! Har et lite spørsmål ang. nedlasting:
Bruker Azerius!

Ved nedlasting står det f.eks 21(150) Dette betyr at det er 21 jeg er tilkoblet og 150 i svermen... hva kan jeg gjøre for å bli tilkoblet flere av de 150?:S 

When I download a torrent I have f. eks 21 on-line and 150 in swarm... What can I do to get more on-line?

På forhånd takk:D
Thx:D"

,Madya,2008-02-20T10:31Z,"Yeah it's not working, what should i do?"
,BlizBob,2008-02-21T15:11Z,"Marmeladi
The files are ""rar"" files. You need a program like winrar to open them.
First you install winrar (or other) then double click the first rar-file. You should see a window where there is a file called ""sub-tsm.sefi.img"".
Press ""extract to"" and select the folder where you want the bin-file to go.
Then you can mount the image file to a virtual cd/dvd-drive like daemon tools or burn it to a disc. Remember to use ""burn image to disc"" function when you burn it. If you just burn the img-file to disc you won't be able to play it in your dvd-player."
