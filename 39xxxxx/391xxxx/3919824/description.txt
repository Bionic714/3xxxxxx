Around 600 eBooks about esoteric stuff in German (High Magick, Druids, Runes, Astrology, Reiki and Usw). This is the reason why I'm learning German! Enjoy and Share, Cheers.

PS: If someone can share the Edred Thorson eBooks about The World Tree, Rune Magick and Seidr, I'd really be thankful.

Cheers
