                       Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This week, we present Brian's interview with writer Philip Winslow about his 
controversial memoir of three years spent on the West Bank with the Israelis 
and the Palestinians...and Don Murray takes us into the archives with a 
documentary about the diplomats who first conceived of a state that became 
Israel.

The struggle between Israelis and Palestinians over the hotly disputed land 
that both regard as their own has been called famously a "Clash of Two Rights". 
It has been a flashpoint for international conflict for generations.

What would it be like to work in the middle of the conflict, where Israeli 
troops and Palestians cilivians meet daily on the West Bank? Someone who 
learned first hand is Philip Winslow, a former United Nations relief worker. 
He spent almost three years from 2001 and 2004, during the second Palestinian 
intifada, trying to mediate the daily disputes at military checkpoints and 
refugee camps. His job was to escort Palestinians and aid through the 
checkpoints.

Winslow, who is an American, wrote a book about the experience. The book's 
title is: Victory For Us is to See you Suffer: In the West Bank with the 
Palestinians and the Israelis . It's a controversial look at two societies 
locked in a destructive struggle. Brian met Winslow many years ago when they 
were both young reporters. Winslow had a long career working as both a 
television and radio foreign correspondent before becoming a relief worker.

History, as usual, is the key to understanding the conflict in the Middle East. 
We also present a documentary, rich with archival footage, by the CBC's Don 
Murray about how Britain's Balfour Declaration in 1917 first conceived of a 
state, now called Israel, inside territory long regarded, in the Middle East, 
as Palestinian.
