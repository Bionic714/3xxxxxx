This DVD is a tribute to LARRY SCOTT, the first ever Mr Olympia Champion in 1965 and 1966. Larry is not only a great champion who is still in top shape today, he is also a great motivator and teacher.

The main part of the DVD is his inspirational seminar given at the 2006 FitExpo in California (43 mins).

Other early years posing highlights include Larry winning the 65 and 66 Olympia titles, guest posing in 1965 and his posing at the 1964 IFBB Mr Universe.
