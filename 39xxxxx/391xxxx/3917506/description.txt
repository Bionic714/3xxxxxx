It's not easy to shock and disturb. You can hold a piece of poop in front of someone and make him or her say yuck, sure that's easy. However, to truly shock and disturb, to really get into someone's head, is not so easy. August Underground does this, and does it well. August Underground succeeds in showing us what serial killers are exactly. Sick and depraved minds that are not to be taken lightly. If you are a casual fan of horror, Screams, Urban Legends, and I Know What You Did Last Summers, then stay away from this film. However, if you are a fan of intense horror from the 70's through today (I'm talking the Fulci's, D'Amato's, Argento's, Guniea Pig Series, etc.) and you have a strong stomach (and conscience) then you owe it to yourself to take a look at Absu Film's August Underground. It's guaranteed to shock, sicken and disturb you
