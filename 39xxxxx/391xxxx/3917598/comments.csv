sukidayo: 

I just downloaded your copy of Zero Limits, wondering why the total size, 67.68MiB, was so small.  Thinking that everything was even more condensed, I found out that your upload is only 3  CD's.  There are a total of 6!  FYI, there are a total of 6 CD's."

,Sfinx_P,2010-10-02T08:24Z,"I listened to this with an open mind and I'm trying to use the method. It seems that if you can get past the fact that Joe Vitale is advertising other projects, Zero Limits works. For a better understanding i suggest watching Dr. Hew Len's interview on youtube. Thanks for the upload"
