,dwood1,2009-03-25T06:06Z,"No what hit?!
What is the deal there?
Otherwise good torrent!"
,Hal440,2009-03-31T01:06Z,"iRobert- you seed automatically

if you move the file or delete the torrent then you stop seeding. if everyone did this then no one can download!

I recommend to seed to at least 2.0 ratio, but the higher the better
