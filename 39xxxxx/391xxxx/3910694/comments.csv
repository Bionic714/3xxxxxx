[T],dreadpirate491,2007-11-27T21:10Z,"Actually don't download anything from there. Every post was made on the same day, so it's probably full of trojans and other bad stuff."

,lordquilton,2008-05-23T15:17Z,"Thanks for the Torrent!
For those with questions regarding the TCommander, here's what I did-
1.After opening TCommander, navigate the left panel to the folder you have downloaded (Adobe Illustrator CS3).
2.Navigate the right-hand panel into Program Files/Adobe (or create a folder with that name first if you don't have Adobe on your machine)
3.Drag the folder in the left panel (Adobe Illustrator CS3), over to the right panel.
4. Sit back and marvel as TCommander does it's thang...

 It all seems to work now, it saves, the saved files have Illustrator icons on them and so forth.
Still not getting Help to come up though. "
,glooper,2008-05-30T11:26Z,"Thanks a lot pirate. Great programme. 

One problem - the help doesn't work. 

Anyone got any answers? Can I just patch this or do I need to download a whole other version?"

,chrome121,2009-04-05T23:50Z,"Great download, works perfectly fine.  Follow the directions on how to use the Tcommand and you must install the .dll files into the same folder that the Adobe Illustrator icon lives.  Thanks again!!!"
,samatirut,2009-04-20T00:17Z,"Thanks a lot! It works perfectly, though when I launch the program it says that ExtendScript.dll file is missing. But I don't mind because it works. And this portable version much smaller and starts and works more faster than that of the giant version.

And it CAN save! :)"
,DeadlockRadium,2009-05-27T17:51Z,"The difference between Adobe Photoshop and Illustratoor can be read here:

http://www.webproworld.com/submit-your-logo-review/40089-making-logo-photoshop-vs-illustrator.html

The thread at the link may be old, but the difference between Illustrator CS3 and PS CS3 is probably about the same though."
,sh0nuff,2009-06-11T11:19Z,"Tcommander doesn't seem to function under Windows 7 64bit (the version included in this torrent is the 32 bit one, and I cannot find a 64 bit anywhere)  Even attempting to copy the files manually to the program files adobe folder, none of the apps (tcommander or AI CS3) will launch."
,dilbertgeg,2009-10-17T13:05Z,"My DL gave me the Illustrator.exe and other files in ""Program Data"" that goes into %App Data% in Windows and such.  That would be %username% and ""Application Data"" for noobs.

Anyhow, I had already installed Photoshop and Flash, so that %App Data% stuff was already present.  I only needed to use Illustrator.exe.

NOTE:  The instructions to copy Illustrator.exe to ""Program Files\Adobe"" seem not correct.  Warnings of missing DLLs.

Instead I could create a new folder under \Adobe and copy the needed DLLs into it, one at a time --- OR --- I just put Illustrator.exe inside the ""Adobe Flash CS3"" folder, where it could feast on whatever DLLs it wants. Seems OK. "

HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!


IT also WONT load any of the fonts my computer has. why?? they don't show in the drop drown menu.. 

It seems like the program is not fully installed on the pc, can I fix this?

DONT ignore this question please i signed up just to ask..

thanks."
,signmaker4474,2009-12-05T05:27Z,"Everything seems to work.  Although, when opening files and changing the directory to the location of the desired file, it seems to take a long time.  And, when saving files, I have to hit save twice and then the screen flickers a few times before it saves.  Not huge issues but in those instances it runs slowly.  However, it could be my antiquated computer.  Also, you have confused everyone with the Tcommander program.  It is not necessary whatsoever.  Simply move and/orcopy the illustrator icon and program data folder to the program files/adobe folder on your hard drive.  And drop the dll files in the same folder.  I appreciate the download but in the future you need to explain things step by step and leave out the Tcommander part."
,BFR67,2010-01-28T23:49Z,"As said above , It works perfectly with the missing files from latrina_100

Many Thanks!!"
