Recorded live at Indiana University, Jeff Foxworthy delivers rapid-fire, joke-after-joke anecdotes about the pitfalls of family life. Foxworthy's in-laws, wife, and kids are a source of endless problems and amusement, creating familiar scenarios everyone can laugh at whether they have a Southern background or not. The huge gulf between male and female methods of communication ("I know what women want, they want to talk"), the dangers of taking the kids down the cereal aisle at the supermarket, and the ever-lurking toilet paper shortage are but a few of the "joys" of married life he good-naturedly skewers. Foxworthy also does a few virtuoso vocal bits on language, mimicking the typical stock-car driver's unintelligible remarks after a race (in "Jeff Gordon Enunciates") and, of course, a few more examples of what it takes to be a redneck, his most famous routine. --Wally Shoup
