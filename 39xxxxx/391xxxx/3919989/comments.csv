,D0gSoldi3r,2008-03-11T00:04Z,Thanks for the torrent if it works :/ 66 megs seems kind small for application like this but i need dreamweaver 8 cause the new Adobe dreamweaver sucks really bad.
,kitcer,2008-03-12T01:03Z,"Don't worry, works perfectly.
Not quite sure how I got it that small, but I downloaded it straight from Adobe so ^_^"

,floydxt,2008-06-13T19:15Z,"Ok so I downloaded it. The trial installed correctly... but when I press ""buy"" it takes me to the registration website and gives me a ""404"" error.

 Is there another way to register this product?"
,kennypashel,2008-07-11T17:39Z,"When I click ""buy"" to register with the key it takes me to a dead link, 404 error.  Any other way I can register this?  They must've just done this because I don't see any one else having any other problems before this month...lucky me."
,meatcage,2008-08-30T04:35Z,"Crashed Windows explorer.exe and failed to install anything (except possibly a virus).

Don't bother."
,kitcer,2008-09-13T05:17Z,"Meatcage, I don't think 13 people would be seeding it if it had a virus. Use your head."
,dimepÃ¥se,2008-12-04T15:43Z,Works just fine! Thanx a bunch Arox!
,sasko99,2009-01-05T09:31Z,Thanks
,kitcer,2009-03-10T23:47Z,"Sorry meatcage, but its never given me any problems, or anyone else for that matter.

I recommend you scan your computer for other viruses or spyware."
,rathya06,2009-06-17T08:09Z,"Hi
