,myshadowie,2007-12-11T12:51Z,DOWNLOAD VERY SLOW
,BioHaZZarD99,2007-12-18T01:05Z,"I don't know about the other 380 or so people, but I don't like the slow-ass download speeds... GET RID OF THE 5kB/S UPLOAD, AT LEAST UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE COMPLETES IT"
,JJ-Swe,2007-12-18T17:09Z,"I've been stuck on 83,4% for 2 days now, is there anyone that actually managed to download it all? And if there is, SEED! "
,JJ-Swe,2007-12-18T17:40Z,"The 1st episode in here isnt from season 2. It's the 1st episode of season 3, I hope the rest are the right ones, or I've just wasted two days on this torrent."
,BioHaZZarD99,2007-12-18T19:52Z,"You've not been stuck at 83.4%, the torrent only just got there.. Episodes 2 and 3 are good, but I'm watching in order so I've not checked 19 and 22, even though they are done.

It seems the only seeder has a REALLY slow upload speed, but once someone else manages to get the whole thing, everyone should get it at about the same time.. Just hang in there, shouldn't take more than a few days.. If you don't want to wait, drive to the store and buy it. :D"
,phyrewall,2007-12-19T18:30Z,"Episode 1 is named correctly, ""The Titan on the Tracks"", but it is actually Episode 1 of Season 3 ""The Widow's Son in the Windshield"""
,phyrewall,2007-12-19T18:32Z,"Ah, maybe I should read all the comments before posting. The rest of the episodes seem correct so far."
,BioHaZZarD99,2007-12-20T05:18Z,"Episode 19 is actually the last episode, it was just numbered wrong.. other than that the names check out..

Torrent's at 96.2% for me and about 100 others at the time of this posting... should be done in the next 24 hours or so.... remember to SEED after you're done downloading, no matter HOW long it took"
,Malinkenskaftet,2007-12-20T18:31Z,"All Done. I'll seed for four days, thats how long it took me to get it. "
,BioHaZZarD99,2007-12-20T19:35Z,"No matter how long it took for me to download it, I'll seed until I get a ratio of at least 2.5 :)"
,BioHaZZarD99,2007-12-21T01:22Z,"Well, seems like already about 50-75 people have dropped the torrent after fully downloading it..


THANKS A WHOLE LOT GUYS!!! *sarcasm*

I'm gonna be seeding for a long time, but I only have 22kB/s standard upload, 28kB max if I don't want to download anything, but most is currently being used by another torrent, so it's a little slow coming from my end.... I'll keep it active though. :)"
,sergeprotector,2007-12-23T11:52Z,"Is this a DVD Rip? As far as I understand, ""/Bones.2x19.Player Under Pressure.avi"" wasn't aired due to VTech Massacre. Somebody posted that 2x19 is actually the last episode, so what is 2x22, because my understanding is, only 21 episodes were aired in season 2."
,DC_DJ,2007-12-24T03:27Z,"This torrent can blow a great white for all i care, viewed all eps now and they arenÂ´t in a straigth line. And ep 21 and 22 are the same ep. And the first ep seems to be the first of s3 as far as i can tell, or its just a wierd storyline but i can imagien.

Merry Xmas."
,DC_DJ,2007-12-24T03:30Z,"After viewing s3 first ep, yes the s2 ep1 in this torrent is idd s3 ep1. Someone screwed up bigtime."
,Tommi109,2008-02-17T10:40Z,took me 1 and 1/2 day to dl this so i will seed for the same time
,rc71,2008-04-24T11:12Z,Ep 19 is titled from an episode in s3.  Is the title wrong or is the episode missing in this torrent like ep 1 was missing.
,MadSkull0409,2008-05-17T10:11Z,"Several items (1 and 19-20) are out of place.
* 2.01 (Titan on the Tracks) is 3.01 (The Widow's Son in the Windshield)
* 2.19 (Bones.2x19.Player Under Pressure.avi) is (2.19 - Spaceman in a Crater)
* 2.20 (Bones.2x20.Spaceman In A Crater.avi) is (2.20 The Glowing Bones in 'The Old Stone House')
* 2.21 (Bones.2x21.The Glowing Bones In The Old Stone House.avi) is (2.21Stargazer In A Puddle)
* 2.22 (Bones.2x22.Stargazer In A Puddle.avi) is  (2.21Stargazer In A Puddle)


I would recommend not downloading:
Bones.2x22.Stargazer In A Puddle.avi

And finding a torrent for:
Bones.2x01.The Titan On The Tracks.avi"
,sunflower363,2008-08-24T18:26Z,"What a MESS!

I'll seed but beware the episodes are out of order and/or named incorrectly."
,Sneb_Goupter,2008-12-16T13:31Z,"Hi Geeli.....
Thanks for the great torrent.. Excellent Quality and for the mix-up in the list, who cares they are easily sorted. so thanks again....."
