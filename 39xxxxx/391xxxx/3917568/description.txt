1. Playfull Day
2. Only Star
3. Orange
4. My Blue Plane (soto version)
oto! now back with an "s", to make "soto". a slightly more poppy, yet, more experimental outing here. texture. colors. voice. computers. instruments. did i say texture. oh what a lovely texture it is. a tapestry? it's up to you i suppose. i won't tell anyone. so work with me here.. imagine this, sawako, meets shugo tokumaru. top glitchtography, and soft japanese folk styling's will keep you and everyone charmed for days and days. prefect for hanging out in front of the fire this winter. top your holiday list with a donation to these fine people for their top gear work.
