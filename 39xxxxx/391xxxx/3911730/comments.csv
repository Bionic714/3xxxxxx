I have a different theory....

The sound is only stereo...and it actually seems like all the dialog you cant hear...but see subtitled...are spoken ""off camera""...as in could be in the surround sound...witch isnt included in this release :D"

its more likely that the subs were based off the version of the disney rip that actually includes these ""funny"" comments. The subs probably include these parts but the audio doesn't. Hard to find to the one with the funny dialogue."
