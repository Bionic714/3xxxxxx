If anyone get the error ""GameName.RWG"" or any kind of[it was my tiny mistake when i made installer] than here is the solution.

Point to the shortcut on the desktop and right clik it and go to properties and click on ""find target"" this option will take u to the program direcotry. now point to ""Gamename.exe"" and again right clikc it and send to the desktop [creat shortcut] now u can play from desktop icon.
