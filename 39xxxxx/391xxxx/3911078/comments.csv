,Sovikos,2007-11-29T07:30Z,"Yeah I gotta say this was one set of torrents that definitely got me hooked when I saw then (I think around #78)!  I really enjoy listening to how other artist interpret and sing covers of songs.  I specially love the slow ones getting a bit of a kick & a higher tempo.  And love the slower renditions of some of the high paced songs.

Great stuff!  Without a doubt probably one my favorite downloads."

A helpful fellow named Quickless has put up a compilation of many (1-191) compilations so far, weighing ~10 GB and worth every minute of waiting ;)

Here is the link:
http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3870505/Metal-Hard_Rock_Covers_1_-_191.3870505.TPB.torrent


On other news:
I have noted that you provide us with 320kbit/sec VBR quality - keep it up, Biomechanical! :)


And, finally:
A question I would really like to see answered, because it's going round my head all the time:
What is your method, Bio? I mean: How do you come up with so many different bands, so many different songs... some so rare I have never heard of them, yet they exist!
How do you come up with all that sheer genius?
Or short: What is your method?


Thanks@all
Keep seeding, so everyone can enjoy _good_ music!"
