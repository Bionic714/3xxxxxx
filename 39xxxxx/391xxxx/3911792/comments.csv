,ianwilly,2007-12-02T19:35Z,there you go it gets 1 star from me ;)
,GetSeeding,2007-12-02T21:45Z,"TRUE REVIEW: This is actually a really good quality cam. There was only one scene where things were too dark to tell what was happening but from the sounds, it wasn't anything important. The camera doesn't shake and there are no annoying heads in the way. The sound quality is about a 7 out of a 10 because it is a cam. As for the movie itself, I personally enjoyed it for the action, T&A and mild, dark humor. I look forward to a sequel."
,peterm12345,2007-12-02T23:59Z,"mr potato head you must be some kind of moron
how the fuck are you ment to get a dvd rip when the dvd isnt out , if you dont like CAM's dont fucking download it "

All the 'do not distribute' or movies with the fuzzy area that had the time index, those are all just such DVDs.

,thisme,2007-12-10T00:25Z,"Why is everybody bashing the uploaders? They're making a great effort getting you what you want, for free!

,anarhije,2007-12-11T00:51Z,It's a very bad film. I don't know if this is the DL I watched. Sound/etc was great. But the film is crap. Really. Bad. Very bad. Avoid.
,thimiesama,2007-12-11T01:17Z,"Shouldnt been that guy as 47. He looks like a fag :S. Vin disel should have gotten the roll, as the rumour was told -.-. but will see the film after all but not from cam"
,ravi000,2007-12-11T04:54Z,"You all dont know to appreciate anything. Why the fuck does the movie have to be same as the video-games? the filmmakers have experimented on some things to make the film look a bit different from the games. Vin diesel doesnt even look like 47. Look at his face. On the other hand, Timothy looks exactly like how agent 47 looked in Hitman 'Contracts'."

The actor they chose, in my opinion, looks pretty much like the guy in the videogame."
