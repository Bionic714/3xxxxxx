And I have to type 'A' for every file I want to extract! Thanks for fonts, but I hope you die in a painful way, windoze lamer."
,anonymousdelivers,2008-12-05T15:26Z,"FUCK, there are only about twenty fonts in ttf and not the one I was looking for. Wonderful waste of time, thx."
,anonymousdelivers,2008-12-05T15:29Z,"oh well, it works at last, nvm."
,hughl,2010-01-27T08:54Z,Font files inside a rar file inside a zip file inside a rar file? GO FUCK YOURSELF.
,djmuggs,2011-02-05T19:10Z,"@anonymousdelivers & hughl - These are 0-Day scene Releases (clearly obvious from there filenames), which if new any thing about, you would be fully aware that this is how they package their files and you would'nt have download them in the first place, its no my doing, I've simply uploaded them, untouched in there orignal first hand state. All you've gotta do is a batch extract using winRar on the hole lot, simple job done, So you go fuck yourself, maybe you should think about uploading your own torrents instead whining like a little bitch just because you don't known how to use a computer."
