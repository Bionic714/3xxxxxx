LUMA presents: 

Arma Armed Assault DVD:

Armed Assault aims to replicate the realism of combat in a highly intense, brand new campaign, all of which takes place on
 islands that may measure up to 400 square kilometers (about 250 sq miles): four times larger than the islands of Everon 
and Malden featured in Operation Flashpoint.

The campaign in Armed Assault takes place on the fictional Atlantic island of Sahrani, a nation which is divided into a 
northern communist regime (called Democratic Republic of Sahrani - DRS) and an oil rich southern democracy called Kingdom
 of South Sahrani. The narrative begins with US forces, after a few months of training in the south, leaving. The northern 

leader uses this moment of weakness to attack the rest of the island. The player takes on the role of one soldier in one of the platoons not rotated off the island before the conflict began. The platoons aids the Royal Army Corps of Sahrani (RACS) in fending off the larger and more powerful neighbourâ??s offensive being spearheaded by the Sahrani Liberation Army (SLA, referred to as "slags" as slang by soldiers in the game).

The campaign follows a linear storyline. However, each level in the campaign will have a multitude of options for the player on how to progress through the mission. The playerâ??s in-game performance and choices determine how the storyline progresses and ultimately will have a bearing on the war itself. For example, a mission to seize a crucial town can have a substantial effect on the story depending on the player's level of success or failure. Failure to successfully complete an objective does not result in the game ending but merely becomes another thread in the tapestry. Hostile squads act independently of the player's actions so that they may be engaging in an activity dictated by the game AI that does not necessarily involve the player. This implies that the game has high replay value as no two games will be identical.

Online Game Queen's Gambit is going to be introduced in September as a followup to the original storyline and will add second event afterward.

The content of the original OFP game is currently being converted to ArmA format and standards, and will be released, at a yet unspecified date, as a free addon, titled "Cold War Rearmed". This addon will contain the original islands, models as well as the campaign and missions.
