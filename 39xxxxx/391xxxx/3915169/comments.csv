,FreeMayk,2008-01-26T17:18Z,"ok, I installed it, cracked it and played it.
BUT when I try to install the 1.05 and 1.08 Patches I get a huge ""INVALID CD KEY"" sing that breaks my heart.... and really irritates me. Any suggestions? anyone, please I need those updates to play with friends online???"
,ogoid,2008-02-05T23:08Z,"To everyone who can't update to version 1.08 because of the ""INVALID CD KEY"" error:

I successfully updated mine game by patching the patch itself. (these are the instructions only for ArmA_InternationalUpdate105_108.exe version (972.517.376 bytes)):

open the file with any HEX editor (search google if you don't have) and set the 6 bytes starting at offset 0x000369EE all to 0x90. I.E.:

they are 0F 84 EF 02 00 00, but after editing become 90 90 90 90 90 90.

this will disable the cd key check."
,thisisborin9,2008-03-14T00:51Z,"... when i try to start it up, there's a error message that pops up and says ""insert the original cd/dvd in. you are using a backup cd"" or sumthing. anyone know how to fix it???"

I had the same problem and renaming luma-AAA.mdf to luma-AAA-AAA.mdf made it work fine. However the torrent becomes unable to seed it because of the name change. So why the uploader chose to do this is far beyond me."
,tomislavvidakovic,2009-04-04T12:14Z,can somebody help me how to patch this game to 1.05 than 1.08 and etc to 1.15??please help with instructions because when I try to install patch 1.05 it writes CD KEY INVALID and it is irritating!please help 
,MrButterBiscuitz,2009-04-12T17:07Z,"When he said change the .mds file to .mdf he was wrong... The simple way to make it mount is to change all .mdf files to .mds, Daemon will only read the .mds file... Once you have done that simply mount the 2.9gb .mds file labeled Arma.AAA and it will work :D enjoy!"

The only games you can pirate and play online are games without cdkeys. If you wanna play online you HAVE TO BUY IT. Period. There is no way around this, there never has been. The only thing you can do is use programs like himachi, and they suck moose cock because noone ever uses it, and it can fuck with your winsock registry entries."
