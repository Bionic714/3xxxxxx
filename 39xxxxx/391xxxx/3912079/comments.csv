,dende5416,2007-11-28T03:51Z,looks like Marvel's been stripped from the DCP collection.
,paulhite,2007-11-28T07:52Z,"First things first:  Thanks for the upload!

dende5416, even ignoring ""Captain Marvel"", I still count 2 comics with ""Marvel"" in the title.  And then X-Men, Avengers, Ghost Rider... How did you take a list like this and develop a conclusion like ""looks like Marvel's been stripped from the DCP collection""?  "
,Deznaj,2007-11-28T11:06Z,"Marvel hasn't been stripped yet. From what I could gather from the Z-Cult FM forum, it seems that the DCP uploaders are having doubts what to do.

They either will strip the Marvel comics and stay on the Z-Cult FM tracker, or they will move to another tracker where they can post ALL comics. They even might do both!

We'll see what they did in about a week. Then the Z-Cult FM tracker will be free of Marvel comics."
,dende5416,2007-11-28T11:08Z,"they're all from the 11/14 release date for comics. Go to the z-cult website, where DCP releases most of their downloads from. They announced all Marvel comics will be down in 7 days. ALL of them."
,dende5416,2007-11-28T11:14Z,"Deznaj -  The release groups still had this weeks comics uploaded way before the DCP release. It looks much more like they just momitted the new Marvel releases for this week. Z-cult wasn't the only comic site hit by Marvel, either, so the tension for them is kinda high."
,processcolour,2007-11-28T14:03Z,"There's been cease and desists from both of the big two to the trackers, and one scanner is being actively pursued on criminal charges. The Pirate Bay, yet again, has stepped up to the plate. 

In terms of comics preservation, DC is not planning to digitally release back issues at all, making the ""digital comics preservation"" part of DCP still too legit to quit on the DC front, I reckon. 

The Marvel subscription offer is? interesting. I still think it's worth digitally preserving Marvel issues and releasing them into the wild, where their chances of long-term survival are better. 
I think the crippled viewing program (proprietary software? You don't get to keep any downloads, anyway) brings it back to a borderline decision. I may keep preserving via torrents as well as subscribe. 

I'd be interested to hear what others think.

All Hail the Scanners!"
,goblin1,2007-11-28T15:52Z,"Unfortunately, unless it's a tracker the likes of Thepiratebay, we will never see Marvel comics again.
Our only hope is that scanners, like TheDarkrlf, won't be intimidated and continue to scan and use a different tracker than Zcultfm to post their packs.
The cult is not to blame, they have rules and they're following them."
,Geno79,2007-11-28T17:29Z,"I was going to beg for the scanners to release their Marvel stuff on the PirateBay tracker, but after reading one of the comments that a scanner is being pursued on criminal charges...maybe it's a good idea to quit the Marvel scans. Preserving Marvel Comics in digital form isn't worth going to jail for. 

And really...Criminal charges? Isn't that a little much? "
,dende5416,2007-11-28T19:55Z,"Yeah, but you know? Theres ALWAYS been chances of jail time for most of the rest of what we download, especially including Warez and MP3, since both are either copied or cracked illegaly. This might change the face of how things move, but come-on: if the RIA can't stop it, how in the world do you think Marvel will?"
,StraightEdge89,2007-11-28T21:29Z,"I hope DCP continues to provide Marvel comics for the masses and doesn't stop due to the pressure. I mean with the recent removal of Marvel comics completely from Zcult and the closure of demonoid I hope they can stick with The Pirate Bay and release complete DCP Packs and not stripped versions without Marvel. I mean how else are many of us gonna get our fix without buying them from the comic store.

 Oh SENSATIONAL SPIDER-MAN #41 where are you?"
,OpusDeiPenguin,2007-11-28T21:49Z,"Just announced at Z-Cult, they've been told by both DC & Top Cow not to host their comics anymore. Looks like DCP packs will have to find a new home now."
,brega10,2007-11-29T05:36Z,"DarkElf... thanks for this up!  With the Demon gone, and now Z-Cult... this seems to be the final haven left.  Please continue to post the DCP stuff as you find it.  And post any news you might have about the DCP."
,Pirate2227,2007-12-03T04:18Z,"Thank you Darkelf!

Great upload like ever!!!"
,lord_checha,2007-12-03T21:01Z,"Thank you Darkelf, I love the Marvel Comics, but they do not sell them in my country so DCP is my only choice. Thanks.
"
,tazman44,2007-12-12T20:22Z,Thank you very very much for the time and effort you put into this.
,Leemantheman,2008-01-07T01:36Z,thx dark elf keep up the good work
,F4R207,2008-02-07T10:53Z,Thank you! To bad about Mrvl and KL :\
,sjg100,2008-03-27T01:00Z,How long before Marvel finally decide to release NEW comics digitally!
