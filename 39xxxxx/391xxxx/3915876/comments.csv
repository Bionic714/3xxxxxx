This is really very funny! And that's coming from somebody who normally doesn't like fan made stuff."
,siegieda,2007-12-03T18:01Z,"why do you think i put it up here? it sure wasn't for my sake, i just wanted to share this comic with everyone who wants it. all credits go to the creator, Christopher C Livingston for bringing a bit more joy to the world."
,elextro,2007-12-03T20:43Z,"Thanks for this but It's very slow. Like every other.
what client should I use?

Dante(George),"
,siegieda,2007-12-04T18:00Z,"i cant do anything about the speed, we are using eclipse who throttle bit torrents. as for the client, i happen to know you are using vista, and my experience doesn't go that far (i.e. i never got it because it is s**t). any suggestions from other users would be helpful though"
,siegieda,2007-12-11T22:40Z,"elextro, i also happen to know you are using an internet provider who heavily limit torrents, i'm suprised you can download anything"
,siegieda,2007-12-11T22:42Z,i also suggest that anyone downloading this leave their computer downloading over night. midnight to midday my connection isn't limited so you can download from me pretty quickly
