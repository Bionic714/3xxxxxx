Well, I would be very interested if there were more subs, at least English, which one way or another is a global must?"
,babycharles,2007-11-30T12:46Z,"Sorry, this is a nordic release..."
,xyz901,2007-11-30T16:55Z,"Just curious.
In my country, DVD releases include (apart from native language) almost every major European. 
Your country releases include only Nordic ?"
,ursule,2007-12-01T10:10Z,"xyz901, if you only find releases with several subtitles in your country then it means that you find only international dvd releases and that no company is actually producing dvds just for your market... "
[T],Artleo,2007-12-01T16:38Z," babycharles, please write the French title or give IMDB link. Tusen takk!"
,NofinnishsubsthankU,2007-12-02T00:43Z,"Artleo: babycharles provided you with the production year. How many movies did Jacues Tati in 1953?
He did one, according to IMDb. So why ask?

Vacances de Monsieur Hulot, Les (1953)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046487/

I can agree with xyz901 and add som more IQ to his statement: every release in every country should include english and original language subtitles. Before that happens, you have to do like me, make the effort to learn swedish. Once you know it you won't forget it. "

Well, maybe someday uploads will come with no name at all, just with a year of production or the name of director's cat or mother-in-law ( these will be called  ""high IQ uploads""). For example, everybody knows that in 1953 Tati had a cat named Archibald. So why ask? In formal logic it is called reductio ad absurdum.
But now the original title or IMDB is mandatory. And being able to speak swedish doesn't help when the swedish title is not a literal translation, while 1953 can be just a misprint (alas it happens sometimes), can?t it?
Cheers.

,NofinnishsubsthankU,2007-12-03T02:18Z,"Artleo: Cheers 2 U 4 the funny answer. But please learn that there are many good movies named after the director's cat:
Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958),
Gatto a nove code, Il (1971) a.k.a. The Cat o' Nine Tails,
the segment ""The Black Cat"" from the movie Due occhi diabolici (1990), just to name a few.

There is even a TV-series named after the cat Jacques Tati had in 1953:

Actually, Artleo, I agree with you. There are so many movies and so little time, with original title or IMDb link it's easier to find the pearls.
Thanks 2 babycharles, anyway, the uploaders have done more than their share, that's why I provided the link and the original title."

,LIONED,2011-05-21T22:12Z,"thanks a lot for the all 5 movies, great to find them. Would anyone know where I could find proper english subs for this movies?"
