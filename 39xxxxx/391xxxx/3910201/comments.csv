,canucrackit,2007-11-26T19:13Z,thanks for the comment. glad you like it. and yes its unique! absolutely clean.
,canucrackit,2007-11-27T08:26Z,i can guarantee its not a virus. its only that its compressed. but pressing ctl+alt+deleete there is only one process and thats the pc tools keygens AIO.exe nothing else. I built it with autoplay media studio 6.0 mlook at the certificate by right clicking and then properties then details.
,canucrackit,2007-11-27T08:28Z,Why are there always lamers who try to destroy the life of torrents here? Never seen anything like it. But i now know why you cant scan it. Scan with anti virus before you open it do a full system scan then scan after again with a full system scan. Thats the best proof.
,canucrackit,2007-11-27T17:50Z,kayali thanks for the praise. its a nice torrent and i dont want it to stop aswell. next time i shall make it into an iso so it can be scanned.
,canucrackit,2007-11-28T08:49Z,h33t.com is a good aio source. very clean they make the same aios as me with the same program
,canucrackit,2007-11-30T16:23Z,Ryan is lying. THIS IS 500% CLEAN! I MADE IT MYSELF. IF YOU KNOW WHAT AIOS ARE THEN YOU KNOW THEY ALL SELF EXTRACT AFTER YOU CLICK THEM. THEY ARE ONE .EXE FILE. NONE CAN BE SCANNED. THEY ARE CLEAN. TSRh RELEASES ARE CLEAN. THEY ARE ALL TSRh'S OFFICIAL RELEASES. YOU NOOB!
,canucrackit,2007-11-30T16:25Z,"CAN YOU READ? SCAN BEFORE USE. THEN SCAN AFTER. THAT MEANS ITS 100% CLEAN. APART FROM THE AIO ""INFECTED FILE"" BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE SCANNED BECAUSE IT NEEDS EXTRACTING LIKE A RAR OR ZIP FILE. NOOB."
,eugene0527,2007-12-01T04:16Z,It is 100% infected my antivirus found a Trojan horse Generic5.JEG this is shit for yah
,jpt_3operamailcom,2007-12-01T15:05Z,I scanned it with avast! 4.7 server edition I found no viruses

,Wapinabe,2007-12-30T02:30Z,The Serial Number on ThreatFire doesn't work. I tried it numerous time but no avail. Please help
,Bojan_RnR,2008-01-27T18:36Z,Fucking IDIOTS  Avast PRO found Win32:Dialer-gen[Trj]    DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS SHIT
,Onyl_Ryan,2008-01-29T06:59Z,"Hi Guys,

This is to confirm that there's NO Virus inside the AIO.
This Keygens are safe to use.
Malware is found but it's not harmful.
The Keygen just uses the same script. dont worry it's nothing that would harm the system.

Yes, there are just noobs.
If i were them, if they dont know what their saying just STFU..


Again thanks for this keygens."
,canucrackit,2008-02-07T09:00Z,is packed which means u cant scan it. it is a self-sextracting AIO. im sure might have seen one like this before. you cant scan it but its clean. anything happen to your pc after? NO. then dont assume its a virus. serials are valid but updates wont work so patch it. PLEASE SEED.

,pstterminator4,2008-02-23T17:22Z,AV Scan [INFECTED]
,IIIlllIII,2008-03-09T17:26Z,"Bojan_RnR, and pstterminator4 they are fucking keygens u noobs, keygens almost always get recognized as generic viruses because the script they use ""looks"" like malware to the dumb AV scanner. or do you think that keygens are legal registered programs?? go read IT for dummies... 

No viruses here feel free to download :) unless ur a N0oO0oB!!!"
,robotis1975,2008-04-08T12:28Z,Thank you ronny 500.Registration is ok!!!
,Djvik,2008-04-11T08:06Z,this shit has a virus. my avast pro has detected it .long live avast pro
,cheva-nova,2008-06-11T15:16Z,seeed stuck on 23.5%
,ascari_nations,2008-10-19T16:16Z,"well i found out that virus is a hoax. Norton, kaspersky, mcafee, avg, comodo, pc tools and 1 care found nothn"
,TechWizard86,2008-10-25T10:24Z,"III is right...Keygens are always recognized as viruses because of the kind of code they produce...which is quite random. I have got the same virus ""Dialer-gen"" on hundreds of other keygen torrents. Unless your system malfunctions from a torrent don't come and scare away people...especially if you are noobs."
,TechWizard86,2008-10-25T10:28Z,Random as in one computer may see the keygen as clean and another computer see that very same keygen just happen to generate the same code as a virus IE Win32 Dialer-gen..this download is quite  harmless and you all should try to check up on your technological programming skills. Seems you really don't know what the hell you are talking about.
,TechWizard86,2008-10-25T10:33Z,Or you can approach the situation differently and LOOK AT RONNY'S POST! It worked for me...ronny you are the man! Registration was successful and I now have ThreatFire Pro now.
,chadzkyplo,2012-01-25T04:01Z,TO TSRH TEAM - Thank you very much for helping. I have dl'd DOSPRN cracked by TSRH and it worked fine. May your tribe increase!
